__label__Oncology __label__Chest The IASLC (International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer) 8th edition lung cancer staging system was introduced in 2016 and supersedes the IASLC 7th edition. Standard-of-care lung cancer staging ideally should be performed in a multidisciplinary meeting using the information provided both from CT and FDG-PET/CT with further inputs from the histopathologic findings (pathologic staging). The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines recommend that FDG-PET/CT should be offered to all patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and that PET-positive findings for mediastinal nodes or distant disease need histopathologic or other radiologic confirmation 4. TNM systemT: primary tumor  Tx: primary tumor cannot be assessed or tumor proven by the presence of malignant cells in sputum or bronchial washings but not visualized by imaging or bronchoscopy  T0: no evidence of a primary tumor  Tis: carcinoma in situ - tumor measuring 3 cm or less and has no invasive component at histopathology  T1:  tumor measuring 3 cm or less in greatest dimension surrounded by lung or visceral pleura without bronchoscopic evidence of invasion more proximal than the lobar bronchus (i.e. not in the main bronchus)  T1a(mi): minimally invasive adenocarcinomatumor has an invasive component measuring 5 mm or less at histopathology   T1a ss: superficial spreading tumor in central airways (spreading tumor of any size but confined to the tracheal or bronchial wall)  T1a: tumor ≤1 cm in greatest dimension  T1b: tumor >1 cm but ≤2 cm in greatest dimension  T1c: tumor >2 cm but ≤3 cm in greatest dimension    T2: tumor >3 cm but ≤5 cm or tumor with any of the following features: involves the main bronchus regardless of distance from the carina but without the involvement of the carina invades visceral pleura associated with atelectasis or obstructive pneumonitis that extends to the hilar region involving part or all of the lung  T2a: tumor >3 cm but ≤4 cm in greatest dimension  T2b: tumor >4 cm but ≤5 cm in greatest dimension    T3: tumor >5 cm but ≤7 cm in greatest dimension or associated with separate tumor nodule(s) in the same lobe as the primary tumor or directly invades any of the following structures: chest wall (including the parietal pleura and superior sulcus) phrenic nerve parietal pericardium    T4: tumor >7 cm in greatest dimension or associated with separate tumor nodule(s) in a different ipsilateral lobe than that of the primary tumor or invades any of the following structures diaphragm mediastinum heart great vessels trachea recurrent laryngeal nerve esophagus vertebral body carina   It is recommended that solid and non-solid lesions should be measured on the image that shows the greatest tumor dimension (on axial, coronal, or sagittal planes). Although those lesions that are part solid should be measured on both their largest average diameter and the largest diameter of the solid component, only the solid component measurement is to be used for staging directions 3. Also, the solid component of subsolid lesions should be performed on a lung or intermediate window rather than mediastinal window 3. For those centrally located lung tumors associated with peripheral post-obstructive atelectasis, FDG-PET/CT is useful in further delineating the tumor real size and, therefore, leads to a more precise T staging and, if it is the case, to a smaller targeted volume in radiation treatment planning. N: regional lymph node involvement  Nx: regional lymph nodes cannot be assessed  N0: no regional lymph node metastasis  N1: metastasis in ipsilateral peribronchial and/or ipsilateral hilar lymph nodes and intrapulmonary nodes, including involvement by direct extension  N2: metastasis in ipsilateral mediastinal and/or subcarinal lymph node(s)  N3: metastasis in contralateral mediastinal, contralateral hilar, ipsilateral or contralateral scalene, or supraclavicular lymph node(s) Please note that has been no changes in the nodal involvement staging since the 7th edition of the IASLC.PET-CT plays an important role in staging nodal disease. FDG uptake higher than the blood pool is suspicious, and uptake higher than the liver it is highly concerning for nodal metastases. Endobronchial biopsy of an FDG-avid node is recommended to confirm the disease highest pathologic stage 4.  M: distant metastasis  M0: no distant metastasis  M1: distant metastasis present  M1a: separate tumor nodule(s) in a contralateral lobe; tumor with pleural or pericardial nodule(s) or malignant pleural or pericardial effusions  M1b: single extrathoracic metastasis, involving a single organ or a single distant (nonregional) nodea single extrathoracic metastasis has a better survival and different treatment choices, reason why it has now been staged separately   M1c: multiple extrathoracic metastases in one or more organs   NB: The MX category is no longer used, it was removed in the 6th edition of the TNM system, if presence of metastases is not known the cancer is assigned M0 5.There is a recommendation that the number of metastatic lesions, the larger diameter of individual metastatic deposits, and the number of involved organs should be stated in the radiological report 3. But, please note, that the site of the metastasis by itself is not a prognostic factor 4. FDG PET/CT has a higher diagnostic value for the diagnosis of bone metastases compared to other methods. Therefore, bone scintigraphy is not recommended for staging purposes 4. It is recommended histologic diagnosis when the adrenal gland is the only site of metastatic disease, given the risk of a false-positive 4. Stage groupings  stage 0TNM equivalent: Tis, N0, M0   stage Ia TNM equivalent: T1, N0, M0 5-year survival: up to 92%    stage Ib TNM equivalent: T2a, N0, M0 5-year survival: 68%    stage IIa TNM equivalent: T2b, N0, M0 5-year survival: 60%    stage IIb TNM equivalent: T1/T2, N1, M0 or T3, N0, M0 5-year survival: 53%    stage IIIa TNM equivalent: T1/T2, N2, M0 or T3/T4, N1, M0 or T4, N0, M0 5-year survival: 36%    stage IIIb TNM equivalent: T1/T2, N3, M0 or T3/T4, N2, M0 5-year survival: 26%    stage IIIc TNM equivalent: T3/T4, N3, M0 5-year survival: 13%    stage IVa TNM equivalent: any T, any N with M1a/M1b 5-year survival: 10%    stage IVb TNM equivalent: any T, any N with M1c 5-year survival: 0%   
__label__Chest This is a basic article for medical students and non-radiologistsLung cancer is the most common cancer worldwide and refers to malignancy originating in the airways or pulmonary parenchyma. On this page:  Article: Clinical presentation Pathology Radiographic features Treatment and prognosis Related articles   Clinical presentationPatients may be asymptomatic until locally advanced or metastatic disease. The most common presenting symptoms include cough, hemoptysis, dyspnea and chest pain. Systemic symptoms may also be present such as weight loss, fatigue and clubbing.A locally advanced tumor may cause wheeze and stridor on respiratory examination. A pancoast tumor results in Horner's syndrome, atrophy of hand muscles and shoulder pain.PathologySmoking is the primary risk factor to developing lung cancer. Other risk factors include radiation, asbestos, air pollution, pulmonary fibrosis and genetic factors.There are four major histological subtypes of lung cancer. These are adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, large cell carcinoma and small cell carcinoma. However broadly they are divided as non small cell carcinoma and small cell carcinoma.Radiographic featuresPlain radiographFeatures on chest x ray include new or enalrged focal lesion, widened mediastinum suggestive of lymph node involvement, pleural effusion, atelectasis and consolidation.CTA solitary pulmonary nodule is suggestive of malignancy when its borders are irregular/spiculated, located in the upper lobe, thick wall cavitation, solid component within ground glass lesion and growth on follow up imaging. Contrast enhanced CT chest can aid in determining extent of invasion and lymph node involvement.Pulmonary metastasis is strongly suspected in findings of multiple nodules with known extrathoracic malignancy.Whole body PETUsed for radiographic staging for potential metastatic disease. However should additional lesions be found, further imaging may be required at the specific site to further characterize the lesion.Treatment and prognosisFor non small cell carcinoma, staging is required to determine optimum treatment. Surgical resection with curative intent is reserved in patients with early stage disease. Concurrent chemoradiotherapy is used for more extensive disease.In patients with small cell carcinoma, disseminated disease is present in most patients and thus require systemic chemotherapy. Radiotherapy may also be used in combination.Prognosis is dependent on the stage of disease at presentation.

__label__Chest __label__Oncology Lung carcinomas of the salivary gland type are also known as salivary gland–type tumors of the lung (SGTTLs) or bronchial gland neoplasms. The usual consignation to the group of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) may be unfortunate because the clinical behavior of SGTTLs can be quite different from that of conventional lung cancers 5.EpidemiologySGTTLs are thought to account for 0.1-2% of all lung carcinomas. PathologyThese tumors occur primarily in the central airways and are thought to originate from submucosal glands 5:  mucoepidermoid carcinoma (MEC) of the lung: most common type  adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC) of the lung: second most common type  acinic cell carcinoma of the lung (Fechner tumor)  epithelial-myoepithelial carcinoma of the lung: one of the most unusual primary tumors of the lung Only a few cases of the latter two lesions have been reported in the literature.

It is often classified as a subtype of sarcomatoid tumors of the lung.  On this page:  Article: Epidemiology Pathology Treatment and prognosis See also Related articles References   EpidemiologyIt is rare and thought to account for <1% of all lung cancers. There may be a greater male predilection with tumor generally occurring heavy smokers with peak a occurrence between the 5th to 8th decades of life 1.PathologyIt is defined by coexisting histologic elements of carcinomatous and sarcomatous components.Treatment and prognosisOverall prognosis is generally considered poor 1.

__label__Chest A lung decortication is a cardiothoracic surgical procedure usually performed for situations such as a chronic thoracic empyema or a chronic hemothorax where a diseased, often chronically infected, pleura is debrided from the adjacent lung and removed. It is also sometimes performed in selected cases of pleural mesothelioma 6. This can be performed either as an open surgical procedure or using video assisted thoracoscopic surgical (VATS) technique. 
__label__Chest Lung entrapment is a term given to non-expandable lung due to active pleural inflammation, malignancy, or hemothorax.The term is similar but not entirely synonymous with trapped lung, which is due to pleural inflammation from remote disease resulting in fibrous thickening of the pleura.Radiographic featuresPlain radiographFeatures of lung entrapment include contralateral mediastinal shift, whereas trapped lung there is no mediastinal shift 3.
__label__Chest Lung fissures are a double-fold of visceral pleura that either completely or incompletely invaginate lung parenchyma to form the lung lobes. Each lung has an oblique fissure separating the upper lobes from the lower lobes and the right lung has a horizontal fissure that separates the right upper lobe from the middle lobe. There are numerous accessory fissures that are common anatomical variants. See alsocrossing lung fissures
__label__Chest The lung hila or roots are found on the medial aspect of each lung. The left and right lung roots are similar but not identical.Gross anatomyLeft hilumIn the left hilum the left pulmonary artery occupies the upper part. Below this is the left main bronchus. There are two pulmonary veins, one lies in front, and the other lies below the left main bronchus.Right hilumIn the right hilum the bronchus of the upper lobe and the branch of the right pulmonary artery to the upper lobe originate prior to entering the hilum. Thus, the upper lobe bronchus and artery are found above the level of the right main bronchus and right pulmonary artery. The arteries lie in front of their respective bronchi. The two pulmonary veins are similar to that of the left side, one in front and one below the right main bronchus.The structures of the lung hilum are enclosed in a sleeve of pleura continuous below with the pulmonary ligament.In addition to the structures described above, each root contains bronchial vessels, autonomic nerves, lymph nodes and lymphatic channels.
__label__Chest Lung hyperinflation is a common feature of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). It is also linked to aging and other chronic diseases that cause airflow obstruction.PathologyThe airflow limitation during expiration is produced by two factors: destruction of the lung parenchyma in healthy subjects, the volume reached by the lungs after exhalation is determined by the balance of forces between the inward elastic recoil pressure of the lung and the outward recoil pressure of the chest wall aging or pulmonary parenchymal destruction from other causes (e.g. emphysema) results in a displacement of this point of equilibrium to a higher volume   airway defectssuch as mucosal edema, remodelling of airway mucus or impaction. In these cases, the expiratory airflow limitation is increased during exercise  The diseases that limit expiratory airflow produce lung hyperinflation. The most characteristic is chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Other diseases that cause an obstructive airflow pattern are: asthma cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis bronchiolitis some interstitial diseases such as Langerhans cell histiocytosis  lymphangioleiomyomatosis the early stages of these two diseases, advanced stages show a restrictive pattern    Radiographic featuresPlain radiographObservable features include: flattened hemidiaphragmatic contours considered one of the most sensitive indicators of hyperinflation and interobserver variability is small best seen on the lateral chest radiograph and consists of a loss of height of the convexity of the hemidiaphragm to measure, it is possible to draw a line connecting the sternophrenic angle and the posterior costophrenic angle this arch height should be greater than or equal to 2.5 cm it is considered clearly pathological when measures less than 1.5 cm   minor measures correlate well with the functional importance of airflow obstruction     retrosternal space measurementa horizontal line is drawn from a point allocated 3 cm below the junction between the manubrium and sternal body, on the posterior cortex of the sternum, and the ascending aorta point; in cases of increased retrosternal space, this distance is equal or greater than 2.5 cm   air trapping: when comparing two radiographs acquired in maximal inspiration and maximal expiration, the vertical movement of the diaphragm is less than 3 cm appearance of the ribs: more than 6 anterior or 10 posterior ribs above the diaphragm level on the midclavicular line horizontalisation of ribs   presence of air below the heart increased anteroposterior diameter of the chest, also called barrel chest hyperlucent lungs (i.e. less bronchovascular markings per unit area) CTObservable features include:  air trapping: best seen in expiration measuring the length of the anterior junctional linethis is a measurement of the retrosternal space more reproducible than in the chest radiograph   saber-sheath trachea a pathognomonic finding of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)  it refers to a decrease in the diameter of the trachea in the coronal plane and increase in the sagittal plane it can be also seen on the chest radiograph comparing the posteroanterior and lateral projections   vascular changes an indirect sign of destruction of the lung parenchyma emphysema causes destruction of the lung parenchyma and pulmonary arterial hypertension    
__label__Chest Lung parenchyma is the portion of the lung involved in gas transfer - the alveoli, alveolar ducts and respiratory bronchioles. However, some authors include other structures and tissues within the definition.Related pathologyparenchymal lung diseaseSee alsoparenchyma
__label__Trauma __label__Chest The lung point sign is a highly specific ultrasound sign of pneumothorax. It involves visualizing the point where the visceral pleura (lung) begins to separate from the parietal pleural (chest wall) at the margin of a pneumothorax. In the absence of pneumothorax, the two pleural layers slide along each other creating a series of comet tail artefacts on ultrasound referred to as the sliding sign. However when air sits in the pleural space and separates the two pleural layers no sliding is seen, referred to as absent sliding sign.The junction between sliding lung and absent sliding is known as the lung point and identification of this is near 100% specific for pneumothorax and also gives an indication of pneumothorax size by its location. It is not able to be found in all pneumothorax cases (sensitivity is around 65%) especially large pneumothoraces where the lung is collapsed and there is globally absent sliding. 
__label__Chest Lung-RADSTM (or lung imaging reporting and data system) is a classification proposed to aid with findings in low-dose CT screening exams for lung cancer. The goal of the classification system is to standardize follow-up and management decisions. The system is similar to the Fleischner criteria but designed for the subset of patients intended for low-dose screening studies.

It was the American surgeon, Evarts Ambrose Graham (1883-1957) who introduced pneumonectomy as a curative treatment for bronchogenic carcinoma in 1932 2,3.
__label__Chest Lung torsion is the rotation of a lung or lung lobe about its bronchovascular pedicle and resulting in ischemia. It is very rare and typically occurs in the setting of lobectomy or pneumonectomy. It has also been reported as a rare complication of less invasive procedures such as video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) 11, following large-volume thoracentesis 15, or even spontaneously in the native lung. On this page:  Article: Epidemiology Pathology Radiographic features Treatment and prognosis Differential diagnosis References   Images:Cases and figures  EpidemiologyIt has a reported incidence of 0.09-0.4% 12.PathologyTorsion results from rotation of a lobe (or entire lung) around hilar structures. The degree of rotation is variable, ranging from 90° to 360° (most commonly 180°).The torted lung creates a trifold compromise of the airways, arterial blood supply and the venous-lymphatic drainage 13 due to luminal kinking.  The affected lobe often shows hemorrhagic infarction or necrosis.Risk factorsDescribed predisposing factors include 7 : presence of a pneumothorax and/or pleural effusion existence of a free and long vascular pedicle to the lung existence of a non-ventilated lobe LocationIn the setting of a prior lobectomy this has been classically described affecting the middle lobe where there has been a right upper lobe resection 18.Radiographic featuresPlain radiographOn plain film, it can be suspected when a collapsed/consolidated lobe is seen in an unusual position especially in the context of a recent pneumonectomy 4. The affected lobe is often opacified 5. Rapid opacification of the lung following trauma/surgery or marked change in position of the opacified lobe on short interval serial radiographs or an unusual position of a collapsed lobe can aid to the diagnosis. Other radiographic findings include inappropriate hilar displacement and a reticular pattern from venous congestion.CTFindings are often non-specific and the involved lung may simply appear atelectatic. A high index of suspicion, particularly in the post-surgical setting, is required. CT angiography, especially with maximum intensity projection (MIP) reconstruction, is particularly useful in demonstrating a twisted pulmonary artery morphology 16. bronchovascular findings tapered obliteration of the proximal pulmonary artery and accompanying bronchus (may appear similar to mucus plugging 16)  antler sign: abnormal curved orientation of the main pulmonary artery with branch vessels appearing to originate from a single side (versus normally-distributed arborisation) 16  amorphous soft-tissue attenuation at the hilum   pulmonary parenchymal findings loss of normal parenchymal enhancement poorly-enhancing consolidation with increased volume ground-glass attenuation interlobular septal thickening intralobular linear attenuation   abnormal appearance of the fissure post-lobectomy "neofissure" can appear to bulge, with unusual orientation change or unexpected position of lobectomy surgical staples may also provide evidence for abnormal rotation 17    Treatment and prognosisLung torsion is considered a medical emergency. The optimal therapeutic approach remains controversial 14. The decision for detorsion or lobectomy usually depends on the viability of the torted lung which is better appreciated after open thoracotomy. Detorsion offers lung salvage but if inappropriate, it may lead to thoracotomy and lobectomy. Differential diagnosisOther early or late post lobectomy complications (pneumonia, vascular occlusion) with similar clinical presentation.
__label__Chest Lung transplant complications can occur at variable time intervals following transplantation. It is essential for radiologists to be aware of specific complications as chest imaging is routinely used in the post-transplant assessment.When reporting a postoperative chest radiograph or CT, it is mandatory to check the time interval since the transplantation and the indication for the transplantation.These include:  immediate and early postoperative period (first 24 hours to first week) malpositioned tubes and lines mechanical problems due to size mismatching between the donor lung and the recipient thoracic cage  primary graft dysfunction - pulmonary edema following lung transplantation (reimplantation response) corresponds to a transient ischemic/reperfusion injury that appears as a pulmonary edema in almost every patient during the first three days post-surgery 12    acute lung transplant rejectioncommon process in the first 2 weeks after transplant with good prognosis   hyperacute lung transplant rejectionfulminant syndrome that occurs immediately after the transplant and has a poor prognosis 9   pleural complications 9 pneumothorax hemothorax pleural effusion pleural fistula       intermediate period (1 week to 4 months) acute lung transplant rejection anastomotic (airway) dehiscence airway stenosis  Candida infection: first 3 months 9   CMV infection: between 1 and 6 months 9   Aspergillus infection: between 1 and 6 months 9​​  pulmonary artery stenosis    late periods (after 4 months)​ Mycobacterial Infection RSV infection  chronic lung allograft dysfunction (CLAD)  bronchiolitis obliterans is probably due to chronic rejection 2 - see post-lung transplant bronchiolitis obliterans   upper lobe fibrosis is probably due to rejection 8,9    post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder   
__label__Chest Lung volume reduction surgery (LVRS) is an emerging promising palliative treatment option for select patients with severe, debilitating pulmonary emphysema. It usually involves bilateral wedge resection of 20-30% of the most diseased lung through a median sternotomy.  It has been proposed that LVRS reduces size mismatching between the hyperinflated lungs and chest cavity, which in turn restores outward circumferential pull on bronchioles (increasing elastic recoil) and improving expiratory airflow dynamics.Assessing suitabilityPre-operative suitability is often assessed with a thoracic CT scan. This should also be complimented by relevant clinical factors (e.g presence of severe ischemic heart disease etc) and respiratory function assessment.Radiographic parameters used in assessing suitabilityFactors that are generally thought to be favourable factors for LVRS include heterogenous pattern of emphysema - patients with large upper lobe lesions: respond better to LVRS than patients with small uniformly distributed disease 3. higher percentage of normal and mildly emphysematous lung at CT 6. younger age 8  Factors that are considered relative contraindications to LVRS include clinically significant bronchiectasis 7  presence of pleural disease 7  presence of unsuspected interstitial disease 7  presence of an increapulmonary mass or concerning nodule. presence of pulmonary hypertension 8  presence of severe airways disease 8  presence of a profound thoraic wall deformity such as a a severe kyphosis 8

__label__Vascular Lymph (also known as lymphatic fluid) is the name given to the interstitial fluid once it has passed into the lymphatic vessels.FormationAs blood passes through capillary beds a significant proportion of the plasma is filtered into the extracellular space. Most of this filtered tissue fluid (a.k.a. interstitial fluid) passes into lymphatic capillaries and is returned by the lymphatics to the systemic circulation. ConstituentsAn accurate composition of the lymph has only been elucidated since the early 2000s. This was primarily due to the difficulty in accessing the tiny lymphatic vessels and obtaining enough lymphatic fluid to examine, but these practical obstacles have now been largely resolved 4.The water, glucose and electrolyte concentrations of the lymph in the initial lymphatics are broadly similar to the plasma; however the concentrations of sodium, potassium, calcium and magnesium ions are mildly decreased, whilst chloride and bicarbonate ions are mildly elevated 5. Clotting factors are present, hence lymph will coagulate when in vitro. In general, it also has a significant protein content, which represents those plasma proteins that cross the capillary walls and are returned to the systemic circulation by the lymphatics. The quantity of lymphatic protein is less than that in the plasma and is dependent on location 1:  liver: 6.2 g/dL  heart: 4.4 g/dL  GI tract: 4.1 g/dL  lungs: 4 g/dL  skin: 2 g/dL  skeletal muscle: 2 g/dL  ciliary body: 0 g/dL ﻿In the postprandial state, aqueous-insoluble fats pass from the gut into their lymphatics, thus this lymph takes on a milky coloration due to its high fat concentration, and is known as chyle.The predominant cellular component of the lymph are lymphocytes, which reach the systemic circulation via the thoracic or right lymphatic ducts.
__label__Musculoskeletal __label__Chest __label__Urogenital Lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) is a rare multi-system disorder that can occur either sporadically or in association with the tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) and is often considered a forme fruste of TSC.​ On this page:  Article: Epidemiology Clinical presentation Pathology Radiographic features Treatment and prognosis Differential diagnosis References   Images: Cases and figures Imaging differential diagnosis   EpidemiologyIt almost exclusively affects women of childbearing age 7. The estimated incidence is 1:400,000 4.Clinical presentationPatients usually present with exertional dyspnea and recurrent episodes of pneumothorax are common 8.In 2011, the European Respiratory Society published guidelines for the diagnosis and management of lymphangioleiomyomatosis, which has established the following diagnostic criteria 9:  definite LAM characteristic or compatible lung HRCT and lung biopsy fitting the pathological criteria for LAM or characteristic lung HRCT and any of the following renal angiomyolipoma thoracic or abdominal chylous effusion lymphangioleiomyoma or lymph-node involved by LAM definite or probable tuberous sclerosis     probable LAM characteristic HRCT and compatible clinical history or compatible HRCT and any of following renal angiomyolipoma thoracic or abdominal chylous effusion     possible LAMcharacteristic or compatible HRCT  In 2016, the American Thoracic Society and the Japanese Respiratory Society published clinical practice guidelines that state a definitive diagnosis of LAM can be established if the patient 10:  has a compatible clinical history: young to middle-aged, female, presenting with worsening dyspnea and/or pneumothorax/chylothorax in the absence of features suggestive of other cystic lung diseases has a characteristic HRCT of the chest has one or more of the following features tuberous sclerosis renal angiomyolipoma elevated serum VEGF-D > 800 pg/ml thoracic or abdominal chylous effusion lymphangiomyomas demonstration of LAM cells or LAM cell clusters on cytological examination of effusions or lymph nodes histopathological confirmation of LAM by lung biopsy or biopsy of retroperitoneal or pelvic masses   PathologyThe disease is characterized by the persistence of dilated lymphatics and interstitial proliferation of abnormal smooth muscle that in turn can obstruct venules, lymphatics, and small airways.In the chest, there are two phases of proliferation in lymphangioleiomyomatosis. The early phase is characterized by proliferation of immature muscle cells that cover alveolar walls, bronchioles, pleura and vessels, including lymphatic routes. In the late phase, there is a development of cystic spaces and wider proliferation of muscle cells throughout the lung.Radiographic featuresLymphangioleiomyomatosis is a multi-system disorder and can affect many organs.ChestMultiple thin-walled cysts throughout the lungs, usually with a uniform distribution. These are present in nearly all cases. If the cysts are small, they may be seen as diffuse coarse interstitial markings on plain films.  general/radiograph  chylothorax: chylous pleural effusion evidence of hyperinflation diffuse bilateral reticulonodular densities recurrent pneumothoraces in complicated cases    HRCT thin-walled cysts of variable sizes surrounded by normal lung parenchyma can be seen throughout the lung interlobular septal thickening may show a dilated thoracic duct hemorrhages may be seen as areas of increased attenuation   Abdomen and pelvis  renal angiomyolipomas: most common abdominal finding 2,3  splenic cysts chylous ascites  lymphangioleiomyomas  uterine fibroids 2  abdominal lymphadenopathy 3  Neckcystic hygromaBoneMay show massive osteolysis with little or no periosteal reaction.

On this page:  Article: Epidemiology Clinical presentation Pathology Radiographic features Treatment and prognosis References   EpidemiologyIt affects females more than males, as it is commonly associated with post-mastectomy lymphedema. Clinical presentationChronic lymphedema with skin and soft tissue tumor in the involved limb. A history of previous radical mastectomy for breast cancer is supportive in cases of upper limb lymphangiosarcoma.PathologyIt is an aggressive malignant tumor that arises from vascular channels of soft tissues in limbs with chronic lymphedema. The pathogenesis is still unclear. Hypothesizes suggest chronic lymphedema may act as carcinogens or cause local immunodeficiency.EtiologyMost commonly this occurs in upper limbs after chronic lymphedema (called Steward-Treves syndrome). Other causes include primary congenital lymphedema, trauma or filarial lymphedema.Radiographic featuresOften, it is radiologically difficult to identify the extent of the tumor. Distant metastasis usually goes to the lung.MRIEnhancing vascular nodular soft issue tumor involves soft tissue and skin of the involved limbs associated with signs of edema within subcutaneous tissues. It is best evaluated by MRI and seen as intermediate T1 signal and low T2 signal masses with post-contrast enhancement.Nuclear medicineThe tumor shows avid uptake on PET/CT.Treatment and prognosisThis is a poor prognostic tumor, the mean survival rate is 2.5 years. The treatment is aggressive surgical resection and amputation of limbs is frequently recommended, even though the recurrence rate still high.
__label__Chest __label__Oncology Lymphangitic carcinomatosis, or lymphangitis carcinomatosa, is the term given to tumor spread through the lymphatics of the lung and is most commonly seen secondary to adenocarcinoma. On this page:  Article: Epidemiology Clinical presentation Pathology Radiographic features Treatment and prognosis Differential diagnosis References   Images: Cases and figures Imaging differential diagnosis   EpidemiologyThe demographics will reflect that of the underlying malignancy (see below).Clinical presentationClinical presentation is variable. Some patients experience dyspnea and abnormal pulmonary function tests early in the course of the disease, well before any radiographic abnormalities are evident, whereas others remain asymptomatic until much later 4.PathologyLymphangitic carcinomatosis is most commonly seen secondary to adenocarcinomas such as 5:  breast cancer: most common 3   lung cancer ( adenocarcinoma in situ) colon cancer stomach cancer prostate cancer cervical cancer thyroid cancer It can also be seen in numerous other primary cancers, e.g. laryngeal cancer, pancreatic cancer, etc. A helpful mnemonic for lymphangitic carcinomatosis is sometimes used for its common causes.MechanismSpread into the lymphatics in most cases (except in bronchogenic adenocarcinoma) usually occurs following haematogenous seeding of the lungs, with subsequent lymphatic involvement 1,3. It may also occur by retrograde spread into the lymphatics from the mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes.Both the peripheral lymphatics coursing in the interlobular septa and beneath the pleura, and the central lymphatics coursing in the bronchovascular interstitium are involved 2.Histologically tumor is seen both within lymphatics and in the adjacent interstitium, with associated edema and desmoplasia 3,4.Radiographic featuresRadiographic appearances can most easily be divided into those due to the involvement of the peripheral (interlobular septa) and central lymphatic system. Involvement may be diffusely of both, or predominantly of one compartment or the other 4. Distribution of changes is variable, but most are asymmetric and patchy 3. It is usually bilateral but may be unilateral, especially in cases of lung and breast cancer.Plain radiographUnfortunately up to a quarter of patients with subsequently established lymphangitic carcinomatosis have normal chest x-rays 2. When abnormal, the most common finding is a reticulonodular pattern, with thickening of the interlobular septa which may resemble septal (Kerley B) lines.CTCT, especially HRCT, is excellent at demonstrating both peripheral and central changes.Typically the appearance is that of interlobular septal thickening, most often nodular and irregular, although smooth thickening may also sometimes be seen 1-4. This results in a prominent definition of the secondary pulmonary lobules, manifesting as tessellating polygons.There could also be an alveolar filling pattern blending into more reticulation 5.Thickening of the bronchovascular interstitium is usually irregular and nodular, with changes seen extending towards the hilum 4. The combination may give a characteristic "dot in box" appearance.Additional HRCT findings include 2,4: subpleural nodules, and thickening of the interlobar fissures  pleural effusion(s): pleural carcinomatosis  hilar and mediastinal nodal enlargement (40-50%) relatively little destruction of overall lung architecture A helpful sign is that the overall lung and lobular architecture is preserved 1. In most cases, lymphangitic carcinomatosis progresses rapidly and patients deteriorate (see treatment and prognosis below), however in some cases changes may remain stable over considerable time 3. As such a 'stable' appearance when compared to previous imaging does not necessarily exclude the diagnosis.Nuclear medicineFDG PET-CTincreased avidity within the nodular interlobular septal thickeningPET-CT has a sensitivity of 86% and specificity of 100% 7  Treatment and prognosisTreatment is determined by the histology of the primary tumor, but in general, relies on systemic chemotherapy.Prognosis of patients with lymphangitic carcinomatosis is poor, with approximately half of patients succumbing to their illness within a year of diagnosis 2,3. Occasionally, long-term survival is encountered 3.Differential diagnosisConsiderations include a differential for that of thickened interlobular septa, with common entities comprising of 1,3: sarcoidosis viral pneumonia  pulmonary edema: commonly bilateral and often have a gravitational distribution radiation pneumonitis lymphocytic interstitial pneumonitis (LIP) See also mnemonic for lymphangitic carcinomatosis ​

__label__Breast Lymphatic drainage of breast originates from breast lobules and flows through intramammary nodes and channels into a subareolar plexus, called Sappey’s plexus. From this plexus, lymphatic drainage takes place through three main routes that parallel venous tributaries. Lymphatics from the left breast ultimately terminate in the thoracic duct and the left subclavian vein, and from the right breast in the right subclavian vein.   axillary or lateral pathway dominant pathway (receives >75% of lymph from breasts) drains lateral quadrants of breast either directly or via Sappey's plexus to axillary nodes  either runs around inferior border of pectoralis major to reach the pectoral group of lymph nodes or pass directly to the subscapular group few channels from superior breast to the apical group sometimes interrupted by the infraclavicular group of lymph nodes     internal mammary pathway originates from both the medial and lateral quadrants of the breast passes through the intercostal spaces and pectoralis major into parasternal/internal mammary lymph nodes connections may lead across the median plane and hence to the contralateral breast    retromammary pathway comes from the deeper portion of the breast drains to the subclavicular plexus   Other pathways occur when usual channels are blocked in disease. Lymph may pass to the contralateral breast, cervical nodes, peritoneal cavity and liver through the diaphragm or through the rectus sheath.Axillary lymph nodes can be divided into surgical levels: level 1: lying below pectoralis minor level 2: lying behind pectoralis minor level 3: lying between the upper border of pectoralis minor and lower border of the clavicle 
__label__Musculoskeletal Lymphatic drainage of the upper limb is via series of deep and superficial channels that ultimately drain into the axillary lymph nodes. Gross anatomyLymph from the hand and forearm drain from lymphatic plexuses via superficial channels that accompany the basilic and cephalic veins to a series of nodes around the elbow: superficial and deep cubital lymph nodes   epi/supratrochlear lymph node(s) one-to-five nodes lying medial to the brachial vein, just superior to the medial epicondyle of the humerus   There are also deep channels that accompany the arteries and drain via the occasional deep lymph node accompanying arteries in the forearm to the axillary nodes. Lymph then drains up the arm, passing through a few deep brachial lymph nodes and deltopectoral lymph node(s) with the cephalic vein at the deltopectoral groove, before draining into:  infraclavicular lymph nodes: predominantly lateral upper limb and lateral two digits  axillary lymph nodes: predominantly medial upper limb and medial three digits 
__label__Vascular __label__Paediatrics Lymphatic malformations are benign lesions of vascular origin that show lymphatic differentiation. It is considered the lymphatic equivalent of a hemangioma of blood vessels. This article focuses on the general features of lymphatic malformations. For a specific discussion in other locations, please refer to: head and neck: cystic hygroma (cystic or nuchal lymphangioma)  hepatic lymphangioma splenic lymphangioma pancreatic lymphangioma renal lymphangioma retroperitoneal lymphatic malformation  On this page:  Article: Terminology Epidemiology Clinical presentation Pathology Radiographic features Treatment and prognosis  Differential diagnosis   References   Images:Cases and figures  TerminologyThese malformations were formerly called lymphangiomas. This expression is out-of-date according to the 2018 ISSVA classification 5.EpidemiologyThey can present at any age but most often occur in the pediatric population (~90% in those less than 2 years old 3). The worldwide incidence of lymphangiomas is 1:6000-16000 live births. Males and females are equally affected.Clinical presentationGenerally, the presentation may be with symptoms related to local mass effect and/or hemorrhage. For example, a lymphatic malformation within the orbit may present with progressive proptosis with acute deterioration in symptoms, the mass effect resulting in compressive optic neuropathy, diplopia/ocular muscle weakness and orbital bruising.The clinical examination may reveal soft, non-tender masses on palpation with a doughy consistency.PathologyTypically comprised of thin-walled cystic masses and can be classified according to the size of the cystic lesions 6:  macrocystic lymphatic malformation previously known as cystic hygroma / cystic lymphangioma, although a term still commonly used when large in the cervical region mean diameter of cystic lesions >1 cm    microcystic lymphatic malformation  ​previously known as cavernous lymphangioma mean diameter of cystic lesions <1 cm    mixed type lymphatic malformation: both macroscopic and microscopic features Their wall consists of connective tissue, smooth muscle, fat, blood vessels, nerve, and/or lymphatic tissue. LocationThey can occur at almost any location: marked predilection in the head and neck: 95% in the neck and axillary regionscystic hygroma (cystic or nuchal lymphangioma)  mesentery, retroperitoneum, abdominal viscera, lung, and mediastinum: ~5% hepatic lymphangioma splenic lymphangioma pancreatic lymphangioma renal lymphangioma retroperitoneal lymphangioma   Associations lymphangiomyomatosis Noonan syndrome Turner syndrome trisomies 13, 18 and 21  Radiographic features Lymphatic malformations may cross more than one compartment. For instance, in the head and neck region, larger lesions tend to occupy more than one deep space, sandwiching between normal structures.Ultrasound multilocular cystic masses internal septa of varying thickness cystic contents: usually anechoic, hyperechoic if debris, high lipid concentration, infection or hemorrhage wide variations exist: solid areas, or mostly solid with cystic foci color Doppler: +/- arterial or venous flow in the septa CTMost  lymphatic malformations appear homogeneous and cystic on CT, but some appear inhomogeneous because of the presence of proteinaceous, fluid, blood, or fat components within the lesion. It is rare for CT to demonstrate intrinsic septations. There is only minimal or no displacement/compression of adjacent structures.MRIFluid-fluid levels may be seen if complicated by hemorrhage. Signal characteristics include:  T1: can be variable especially dependent on protein content  T2: usually high signal Treatment and prognosis Surgical excision or interventional sclerotherapy (with interferon, OK-432, or bleomycin) is often necessary 3. Other possible treatment methods include steroid therapy, laser treatment, aspiration, radiofrequency ablation, or cautery.Differential diagnosisDifferentials will depend on which compartment or viscera is considered. Possible imaging differential considerations include: hemangioma  venous malformation: demonstrate internal blood flow and central enhancement other cystic neck masses teratoma: demonstrate fat or calcification   
__label__Vascular __label__Haematology The lymphatic system (also known as the lymphoid system or systema lymphoideum in Terminologia Anatomica) is the collective term given to the lymphatic vessels and lymphoid tissues in the body 1,4. On this page:  Article: Terminology Lymphatic vessels Alymphatic organs Functions Radiographic features History and etymology Related pathology Related articles References   TerminologyOccasionally the lymphatic system is considered with the reticuloendothelial system (RES), with the combined whole termed the lymphoreticular system.Lymphatic vesselsA portion of the blood entering any tissue capillary bed does not return via the veins but instead forms interstitial fluid in the extracellular space, which is returned to the circulation via the lymphatic vessels (a.k.a. lymphatics), which form the lymph vascular system. When the fluid is in the lymphatic system it is known as lymph. It is known as chyle when the lymph draining the gut also contains chylomicrons from a meal.The lymphatics start as lymphatic capillaries, which coalesce to form larger precollectors and then collector lymphatic vessels. These collecting vessels merge to form lymphatic trunks, before draining into the two largest trunks a.k.a. the lymphatic ducts: thoracic duct and right lymphatic duct, on the left and right sides of the body respectively 10.Overall lymph flow is estimated to be 2-4 liters per day 3.Lymphatic capillariesThe lymphatic capillaries (a.k.a. initial lymphatics or, less commonly, terminal lymphatics) are the smallest vessels in the system and arise in the tissue capillary beds as blind-ending single layer endothelial tubes. Compared to capillaries, the lymphatic capillaries are relatively dilated with greater variability in caliber. Dynamic collapse of the capillaries is prevented by anchoring filaments binding their walls to the surrounding structural tissues 5.Ultrastructurally, the lymphatic endothelium of the capillaries lacks fenestrations with a rather sparse/absent basal lamina. Tight junctions are absent between individual cells of the endothelium 3,4. These cytological features allow larger macromolecules to pass with ease from the extracellular space to the lymphatics, which includes proteins, cellular debris and microorganisms.Precollecting and collecting lymphaticsThe lymphatic capillaries converge to form the collecting lymphatics (or collectors) which have both valves and smooth muscle, with walls similar to veins, although unlike the venous wall, the various tunica layers are harder to distinguish. The number of valves is much greater than in veins.In some lymphatic networks, the capillaries merge to form precollector lymphatics first, which are like the capillaries in that they have a simple single-layer endothelial wall, but are distinguished from them by the presence of valves, but no smooth muscle layer. Smooth muscle in the walls of the collectors creates peristaltic waves ensuring unidirectional flow of the lymph 3,10. A segment of lymphatic vessel between two valves is termed a lymphangion (plural: lymphangia), a contractile unit that ensures the lymph moves to the next lymphangion through their shared interposing valve.This one-way flow is also supported by skeletal muscle action, the inspiratory decrease in intrathoracic pressure and a pressure gradient towards the veins into which the largest lymphatics drain (due to the suction effect formed as the veins continuously drain towards the heart) 3.The collecting lymphatics then pass into the cortex of local lymph nodes as the afferent lymphatics (prenodal collecting lymphatics). The efferent lymphatics (postnodal collecting lymphatics) leave the nodes, either passing to further nodes in the chain or merging with other efferent lymphatic vessels to form the lymphatic trunks.Lymphatic trunksThere are nine named lymphatic trunks in total, comprising four paired sets (one trunk for each side of the body) and the unpaired central intestinal trunk:  jugular trunks: drain the neck  subclavian trunks: drain the upper limbs  bronchomediastinal trunks: drain the chest lumbar trunks  intestinal trunk: drains the gut Finally, the lymph returns to the main systemic circulation via the thoracic duct on the left, and on the other side of the body, the right lymphatic duct.For the most part, subcutaneous lymphatic vessels accompany veins, whilst deeper lymphatics accompany arteries 2-4. The initial lymphatics in the microvilli of the gut wall are specially named - due to their unique function in absorbing and transporting fats - and are called lacteals.Alymphatic organsLymphatic vessels are present throughout the body with the following exceptions: cartilage bone marrow  bone * placenta cornea  brain ** teeth * the presence of lymphatic vessels in the bone is contentious, and if present is much sparser than other body tissues 2,6.** recent work demonstrates that the brain has a lymphatic system, the glymphatic pathway, however, no true lymphatic vessels have been found.The meninges do have a lymphatic system 8.For many years there was controversy surrounding the presence of a lymphatic drainage system in the eye. More recently the presence of lymphatics in the eye seems to have become accepted, although, many of the details remain unknown 7.FunctionsThe primary function of the lymphatic system is to return exuded capillary fluid and protein to the systemic circulation. Approximately 25-50% of the plasma proteins re-enter the central veins every day from the lymph 3. In the GI tract, the draining lymphatics have a key role in transporting cholesterol and long-chain fatty acids (as chylomicrons) to the liver.Radiographic featuresVisualization of the lymphatic system by medical imaging has lagged behind radiology of many other body systems due to the small caliber of many of the lymphatics 9. Methods employed:  direct radiographic lymphangiographyextremity lymphangiography   lymphoscintigraphyextremity lymphoscintigraphy  indocyanine green lymphangiography MR lymphangiography (MRL) History and etymologyThe written historical record likely first describes lymphatics in Classical Greece, when both Hippocrates (c.460-c.370 BCE) and Aristotle (c.384-c.322 BCE) wrote about channels that were likely lymphatic in nature 1. In ancient Egypt, Erasistratus (c.304- c.250 BCE) detailed "milky arteries" in the mesenteric fat 1. In 1622, the Italian anatomist Gaspare Aselli (1581–1625) was the first to describe lymphatics in the modern era. He was actually researching the recurrent laryngeal nerves in canines when he noted some new white cords in the mesentery that filled after dogs had been fed 10,11. Thomas Bartholin (1616–1680), the Danish anatomist, coined the term "vasae lymphaticae", translated as lymphatics, for these vessels, and was the first to distinguish between the chyle-carrying lymphatics draining the GI tract and the systemic lymphatics draining everything else 11. By the end of the 18th century the general arrangement of the lymphatics had been elucidated 10,11.Related pathologylymphedema

On this page:  Article: Terminology Pathology Radiographic features See also References   Images:Cases and figures  TerminologyLymphadenopathy (or adenopathy) is, if anything, a broader term, referring to any pathology of lymph nodes, not necessarily resulting in increased size; this includes abnormal number of nodes, or derangement of internal architecture (e.g. cystic or necrotic nodes). In addition, increase in size is not always pathologic; some nodes are bigger than others normally (e.g compare jugulodigastric nodes to mesenteric nodes), and reactive nodes are a healthy response and do not imply pathology of the node itself.There are approximately 600 lymph nodes, of which only some are available to direct palpation. Only some nodes (including neck, axilla and groin) should ever be palpable and these should be soft and non-tender.PathologyEtiologyThere are many (many) causes of lymph node enlargement which include: infective (acute suppurative) reactive follicular hyperplasia paracortical hyperplasia  sinus histiocytosis granulomatous   neoplastic drug-induced, e.g. cyclosporin, phenytoin, methotrexate lipid storage diseases  IgG4-related sclerosing disease 7  Radiographic featuresThe upper limit in size of a normal node varies with location, and of course the size cut-off used depends on the desired sensitivity and specificity. Cervical lymph nodesSee the separate article: cervical lymph node metastasis (radiologic criteria).Mediastinal lymph nodesIn general 10 mm is considered the upper limit for normal nodes (short axis diameter) 3-5. This does not, of course, take into consideration the fact that all nodal metastases must start at microscopic size, and thus using only size criteria will miss micrometastases. In the setting of lung cancer staging a sensitivity of 0.83 and a specificity of 0.82 are quoted for CT 5.See the separate article: mediastinal lymph node enlargement.Mesenteric lymph nodesMesenteric nodes are increasingly visualized as a result of multidetector volume acquisition and are most easily seen on coronal reformats. Although 3 mm has previously been used as the upper limit for the short axis diameter of mesenteric lymph nodes, up to 39% of healthy normal patients have larger nodes than this. As such a figure of 5 mm is considered normal 6. See the separate article: normal mesenteric lymph nodes.See also differential diagnosis of high attenuation lymphadenopathy differential diagnosis of low attenuation lymphadenopathy

The following is a synthesis of radiologically useful boundaries for each level.Level I: submental and submandibular superiorly: mylohyoid muscle and mandible  inferiorly: inferior border of the hyoid bone  anteriorly: platysma muscle  posteriorly: posterior border of the submandibular gland  ​There are two sublevels:  level Ia (submental nodes): anteromedial between the anterior bellies of both digastric muscles   level Ib (submandibular nodes): posterolateral to the anterior belly of the digastric muscles Level II: upper internal jugular (deep cervical) chain superiorly: base of the skull at the jugular fossa  inferiorly: inferior border of the hyoid bone anteriorly: posterior border of the submandibular gland posterolaterally: posterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle  medially: medial border of the internal carotid artery  ​There are two sublevels:  level IIa: inseparable from or anterior to the posterior edge of the internal jugular vein; includes jugulodigastric nodal group   level IIb: posterior to and separable by a fat plane from the internal jugular vein Level III: middle internal jugular (deep cervical) chain superiorly: inferior border of the hyoid bone inferiorly: inferior border of the cricoid cartilage  anteriorly: anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle posterolaterally: posterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle medially: medial border of the common carotid artery  Level IV: lower internal jugular (deep cervical) chain superiorly: inferior border of the cricoid cartilage inferiorly: level of the clavicle  anteriorly: anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle posterolaterally: oblique line drawn through the posterolateral edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle and the lateral edge of the anterior scalene muscle 2  medially: medial border of the common carotid artery includes medial supraclavicular nodes including Virchow node 1  Level V: posterior triangle superiorly: skull base at the apex of the convergence of sternocleidomastoid and trapezius muscles inferiorly: level of the clavicle anteromedially: posterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle posterolaterally: anterior border of the trapezius muscle  ​There are two sublevels:  level Va: superior half, superior to inferior border of the cricoid cartilage (posterior to levels II and III); includes spinal accessory nodes  level Vb: inferior half, inferior to inferior border of the cricoid cartilage (posterior to level IV); includes lateral supraclavicular nodes 1  Level VI: central (anterior) compartment superiorly: inferior border of hyoid bone  inferiorly: superior border of manubrium (suprasternal notch) anteriorly: platysma muscle 8  posteriorly: trachea (medially) and prevertebral space (laterally) 8  laterally: medial borders of both common carotid arteries (medial to levels III and IV) includes anterior jugular, pretracheal, paratracheal, prelaryngeal/precricoid (Delphian), and perithyroidal nodes Variant anatomic boundariesMinor variations to the above anatomic boundaries have been described.For example, head and neck surgeons may use different intraoperative landmarks 1,4:  levels IIa and IIb are separated by the vertical plane defined by the spinal accessory nerve  the medial border of levels III and IV and lateral border of level VI is defined by the lateral border of the sternohyoid muscle  the posterior border of levels II through IV and anterior border of level V may also be defined by the plane of sensory branches of the cervical plexus In addition, radiologists may describe supraclavicular nodes separately from levels IV and V using the transverse level of the clavicle as the border 9.Additional neck levelsThe above classification is not inclusive of several important nodal groups in the head and neck: superior mediastinal nodes retropharyngeal nodes parotid nodes occipital nodes posterior auricular (mastoid) nodes facial nodes Other classification systems include some of these regions, but a consensus approach has not been reached. For example, with respect to "level VII," radiologists may apply this label to superior mediastinal nodes 2, radiation oncologists may apply this label to "prevertebral nodes" 3, and head and neck surgeons omit this level from their nomenclature altogether 1. Thus, it is best to name lymph node groups outside of the established levels I-VI. If "level VII" is used for superior mediastinal lymph nodes, it should refer to the extension of the paratracheal chain below the suprasternal notch but above the level of the brachiocephalic artery 4.See also cervical lymph node staging cervical lymph node groups 
__label__Haematology The lymph nodes (commonly shortened to nodes, and known as nodus lymphoideus in TA 4) collectively form one of the secondary lymphoid organs.Macroscopically, a normal lymph node is a small ellipsoid structure, approximately 0.1 to 2.5 cm in maximal length 2,3. Nodes often possess a reniform morphology, due to an indentation in their sides named the hilum, where their blood vessels pass in and out, as well as the draining efferent lymphatic vessel 1-3. Nodes lie in clusters adjacent to the lymphatic vessels throughout the body, which both feed and drain the nodes 3.Each node is macroscopically divided into a peripheral cortex and central medulla.The prenodal collecting or afferent lymphatics pass into the node through its capsule, and not at its hilum, and drain into the subcapsular sinus, a contiguous space extending around the periphery of the node (only interrupted by the hilum). From here, the lymph drains via the radially-arranged cortical sinuses into the central medullary sinuses (lymphatic cords), which then coalesce to emerge at the hilum as the postnodal collecting or efferent lymphatic vessel(s).HistologyIn general, a lymph node comprises a predominantly cellular peripheral cortex in which lie the spherical lymphoid follicles (or nodules). The follicle consists of a ball of lymphocytes, with an inner paler germinal center. Centrally within each node is the medulla. Additional non-follicular lymphocytes are located in both paracortical and medullary regions. The B cells are in the follicles and medulla, conversely T cells are concentrated in the paracortical and interfollicular cortical areas 1.
__label__Vascular Lymphoceles are collections of lymphatic fluid that happen most frequently in the postoperative setting. Although they can occur in potentially any part of the body where lymphatic tissue is resected (e.g. lymphadenectomy) or injured in trauma, they are most commonly seen in the retroperitoneum.The collections are usually simple, containing creatinine, urea, and electrolytes in similar serum concentrations. There are no epithelial lined walls, which are made mostly of dense fibrotic tissue. Therefore, on imaging, lymphoceles present as thin-walled simple fluid collections with possible minimal wall enhancement.  head and neck lymphocele lymphocele of the thoracic duct retroperitoneal lymphocele perirenal lymphocele: related to transplanted kidneys in the extraperitoneal space in the pelvis  
__label__Gastrointestinal __label__Chest __label__Vascular Lymphoceles of the thoracic duct, also known as thoracic duct cysts, are lymph-filled collections/dilatations that can arise from any portion of the thoracic duct.The clinical significance of a thoracic duct cyst lies in its misidentification as a pathological lesion at radiological assessment, which can ultimately lead to inappropriate management. On this page:  Article: Clinical presentation Pathology Radiographic features Treatment and prognosis References   Images:Cases and figures  Clinical presentationThey are usually asymptomatic or less commonly may present as a left supraclavicular fossa mass 1.PathologyThe thoracic duct is the main collecting vessel of the lymphatic system. It drains three-quarters of the lymph in the body into the venous bloodstream. The abdominal confluence of lymph trunks gives rise to the caudal origin of the thoracic duct. The abdominal confluence, or the true cisterna chyli when present, extends from the caudal beginning of the thoracic duct to the right of the first and second lumbar vertebrae, lying immediately to the right of the abdominal aorta. The thoracic duct terminates by descending anterior to the first part of the subclavian artery and draining into the junction of the left subclavian vein and the internal jugular vein 1,3.Numerous theories have been suggested to explain the etiology of lymphocele of the terminal thoracic duct. Both congenital weakness in the thoracic duct wall and acquired degenerative process from inflammation have been proposed as causative mechanisms. Trauma has also been suggested as the underlying etiology 1,4,5.Radiographic featuresThe dilated thoracic duct will appear as a non-enhancing, tubular/multicystic, multi-compartmental, water density structure starting caudally from the level of the renal hila in the abdomen extending cranially towards the mediastinum till its insertion with areas of more focal dilatation mounting to cyst formation with attenuation slightly lower than the arteries and veins in attenuation 6.Treatment and prognosisConservative management is generally advocated for lymphoceles of the thoracic duct 1.

It is closely related to other inflammatory conditions in the region, namely orbital pseudotumor and Tolosa-Hunt syndrome. On this page:  Article: Epidemiology Clinical presentation Pathology Radiographic features Treatment and prognosis Differential diagnosis Related articles References   Images: Cases and figures Imaging differential diagnosis   EpidemiologyLymphocytic hypophysitis is seen most frequently in women, with a F:M of ~ 9:1, and often in the postpartum period or the third trimester of pregnancy.Clinical presentationClinical presentation is varied depends on the part of the pituitary affected and the size of the lesion. Lymphocytic hypophysitis can thus be classified as: anterior pituitary: lymphocytic adenohypophysitis most common mimics a pituitary adenoma  endocrine hormone deficits are common, including hypopituitarism  mass effects on adjacent structures (e.g. optic chiasm)   posterior pituitary: lymphocytic infundibular neurohypophysitis rare diabetes insipidus   both anterior and posterior pituitary: lymphocytic infundibular panhypophysitis PathologyIt is characterized by infiltration of the pituitary stalk with lymphocytes, as the name would suggest. Importantly, there is a paucity of plasma cells or granulomas, differentiating it from IgG4-related hypophysitis and granulomatous hypophysitis (e.g. due to neurosarcoidosis) respectively.Associations autoimmune conditions such as autoimmune thyroiditis pernicious anemia   ipilimumab: monoclonal antibody drug Radiographic featuresCTCoronal CT and multiplanar reconstructions can visualize the pituitary region reasonably well. Lymphocytic hypophysitis appears as an enhancing soft tissue mass involving the pituitary and extending into the suprasellar region.MRIMRI, as is the case with other pituitary lesions, is the best modality for assessing this condition which appears as a pituitary region mass.

__label__Chest Lymphocytic interstitial pneumonitis is a benign lymphoproliferative disorder characterized by lymphocyte predominant infiltration of the lungs. It is classified as a subtype of interstitial lung disease. It also falls under the umbrella of non-lymphomatous pulmonary lymphoid disorders. On this page:  Article: Epidemiology Clinical presentation Pathology  Radiographic features Treatment and prognosis  Differential diagnosis See also Related articles References   Images: Cases and figures Imaging differential diagnosis   EpidemiologyLymphocytic interstitial pneumonitis can occur at any age. However, most of the patients are adults with a mean age of 50 years. If a child presents with lymphocytic interstitial pneumonitis, this can be indicative of AIDS.There is a recognized female predilection most likely attributable to the fact that lymphocytic interstitial pneumonitis occurs in patients with autoimmune disease such as Sjögren syndrome, which is by far more common in women 8.Clinical presentationThe main clinical symptoms are a gradual onset of dyspnea and cough with approximately six months duration. Less frequently, patients may have systemic symptoms such as fever, night sweat, arthralgia, and weight loss. If the disease progresses to the end-stage respiratory failure cyanosis and clubbing may develop. Hypertrophy of the salivary glands observed in 20% of patients 11. Pathology There is diffuse infiltration of the interstitium and alveolar spaces by lymphocytes and plasma cells.Associations  Sjögren syndrome: can occur in up to 25% of those with lymphocytic interstitial pneumonitis 6   AIDS: particularly if it occurs in the young 9  autoimmune thyroid disease systemic lupus erythematosus Castleman disease  common variable immune deficiency 10  rheumatoid arthritis pulmonary amyloidosis MarkersIn about 80% of patients polyclonal or IgM monoclonal gammopathy is found 8.Radiographic featuresPlain radiographFeatures can be non-specific, but may include: lower-zone predominant bilateral reticular opacification  chronic bilateral airspace opacification CTThe following features may be seen with lymphocytic interstitial pneumonitis on HRCT, but the findings are not exclusive to its diagnosis: features tend to be diffuse with mid to lower lobe predominance  thickening of bronchovascular bundles  interstitial thickening along lymph channels 2  small but variable sized pulmonary nodules (can be centrilobular or subpleural, and are often ill-defined) ground-glass changes scattered thin-walled cysts usually deep within the lung parenchyma typically abut vessels (i.e. is perivascular or subpleural) size range between 1-30 mm (useful for differentiation from lymphoma of the lung 1)   mediastinal lymphadenopathy Treatment and prognosis The natural history is variable, from near-complete resolution to progressive disease. More than 30% of patients will develop the end-stage disease and honeycombing despite treatment.Transformation to lymphoma can occur, particularly in a patient with monoclonal gammopathy or hypogammaglobulinemia 8. Corticosteroids have been successfully trialled 1.Differential diagnosisGeneral imaging differential considerations include:  pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) cystic changes (pneumatoceles) seen in advanced disease can be difficult to differentiate particularly in those with AIDS     lymphangioleiomyomatosis occur in younger females cysts are generally uniformly distributed throughout the lungs    Langerhans cell histiocytosis smokers bizarre cysts that spare the costophrenic angles  upper lung zone predominant   See also pulmonary lymphoproliferative disease cystic lung disease

__label__Haematology __label__Oncology Lymphoma (historically lymphosarcoma was used for diffuse forms of the disease) is a malignancy arising from lymphocytes or lymphoblasts. Lymphoma can be restricted to the lymphatic system or can arise as extranodal disease. This, along with variable aggressiveness results in a diverse imaging appearance. On this page:  Article: Epidemiology Clinical presentation Pathology Radiographic features Treatment and prognosis Related articles References   Images:Cases and figures  EpidemiologyLymphoma accounts for ~4% of all cancers 4. They are more common in developed countries.In children, lymphoma accounts for 10-15% of all cancers, being the third most common form of malignancy 5.Clinical presentationLymphoma can present as nodal or extranodal disease. Hodgkin lymphoma and low-grade non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) classically present as nodal disease, whereas high-grade NHL can present with complications from mass effect such as superior vena cava obstruction, cauda equina syndrome, etc. Extranodal disease can affect any organ. Lymphoma can often present with B symptoms (fever, night sweats and weight loss). PathologyLymphomas are a malignancy that arise from mature lymphocytes. The etiology is unknown but potential lymphomatogenic risk factors include 4: viral infection, e.g. EBV, HTLV-1, HIV, HCV, HSV bacterial infection, e.g. Helicobacter pylori  chronic immunosuppression, e.g. post-transplantation prior chemotherapy (especially alkalising agents) and drug therapy, e.g. digoxin ClassificationLymphomas are currently classified according to the 2008 WHO classification of tumors of hematopoietic and lymphoid tissues. The main division is into:  Hodgkin lymphoma (Hodgkin disease) (40%)  non-Hodgkin lymphoma (60%) mature B-cell lymphoma mature T-cell and NK-cell lymphoma post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorders   The majority (85%) of lymphomas are B-cell with the remainder (15%) being T-cell 4.LocationAdditionally it is worth, especially for radiologists, dividing extranodal lymphomas according to the location: central nervous system (CNS)  CNS lymphoma  primary CNS lymphoma primary dural lymphoma intravascular lymphoma   secondary CNS lymphoma   pituitary lymphoma lymphoma of the spinal cord   head and neck lymphoma orbital lymphoma sinonasal lymphoma thyroid lymphoma   thoracic lymphoma breast lymphoma cardiac lymphoma  mediastinal lymphomaprimary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma   pulmonary lymphoma primary pulmonary lymphoma secondary pulmonary lymphoma BALT lymphoma AIDS-related pulmonary lymphoma    pleural lymphoma primary pleural lymphoma secondary pleural lymphoma     gastrointestinal lymphoma gastric lymphoma small bowel lymphoma large bowel lymphoma   hepatobiliary lymphoma  hepatic lymphoma primary hepatic lymphoma secondary hepatic lymphoma   splenic lymphoma pancreatic lymphoma   musculoskeletal lymphoma primary bone lymphoma secondary bone lymphoma muscle lymphoma   cutaneous lymphoma mycosis fungoides Sezary syndrome   genitourinary lymphoma renal lymphoma  uterine lymphomacervical lymphoma  vaginal lymphoma testicular lymphoma   multi-regionalMALT lymphoma  Radiographic featuresImaging characteristics will depend on the location and subtype of lymphoma. CT is the workhorse of imaging in lymphoma and plays a crucial role in staging (see main article: lymphoma staging). US and MRI are also used; for example, when assessing cervical lymph nodes (US) or CNS lymphoma (MRI). FDG-PET is used for staging and re-staging of lymphoma.Treatment and prognosisLymphoma cure rates are comparatively high (up to 90%) compared to many other malignancies. Prognosis depends not only on histological subtype and grade but also on stage, hence why imaging plays a pivotal role in treatment. Aggressive lymphomas (e.g. Burkitt lymphoma) typically have a prognosis of weeks without treatment.
__label__Spine __label__Central __label__Nervous __label__System __label__Haematology __label__Oncology Lymphoma of the spinal cord is an uncommon manifestation of lymphoma. Although lymphoma more commonly involves the vertebral body (vertebral body tumors) or epidural compartment, intramedullary lymphoma may rarely occur.  Apparent intramedullary spinal cord lymphoma may often, in fact, represent a secondary invasion of the spinal cord by leptomeningeal disease 8. On this page:  Article: Epidemiology Clinical presentation Pathology Radiographic features Treatment and prognosis Differential diagnosis Related articles References   Images:Cases and figures  EpidemiologyIntramedullary spinal lymphoma accounts for 3.3% of all CNS lymphoma, which constitutes only 1% of all lymphomas in the body 1.The mean age at presentation is 47 years. Females are more commonly affected than males.Risk factorsRisk factors for developing CNS lymphoma include:  AIDS transplant recipients congenital immunodeficiency Epstein-Barr virus infection Clinical presentationClinical presentation is similar to that of other intramedullary spinal tumors, with common symptoms being pain, weakness, and sensory changes.PathologyPrimary lymphoma of the spinal cord is most often predominantly histiocytic or mixed histiocytic and lymphocytic 2. 85% are non-Hodgkin lymphomas 2.The principal microscopic feature is a dense, perivascular, mononuclear infiltrate composed predominantly of large lymphocytes with prominent nucleoli. Most tumors are B-cell derivatives 3.Radiographic featuresThe most common intramedullary location is the cervical cord, followed by the thoracic cord then the lumbar cord 7. Most are solitary lesions, however, there may be multiple lesions throughout the spinal cord.MRIAlthough spinal cord expansion is usually present, in some patients there is relatively minimal enlargement of the cord 4. The lesions are generally poorly defined and tumoral cysts are generally not a feature and secondary syringomyelia is rare 4. Lymphoma usually does not have a hemorrhagic component 8.Reported signal characteristics include:  T1: isointense to spinal cord  T2: hyperintense (this is in contrast to the characteristic low T2 signal intensity that is seen in intracranial lesions)  T1 C+ (Gd): usually solid and homogeneous enhancement 4  Treatment and prognosisRadiotherapy is the primary therapy for potential preservation of neurologic function and extension of survival. Minimal data are available on the role of chemotherapy for primary spinal cord lymphoma 9.The prognosis for patients with intramedullary spinal lymphoma is poor. The survival rate at 2.5 years is less than 50% 3.Differential diagnosisGeneral imaging differential considerations include:  spinal astrocytomatumoral cysts are more common   spinal ependymoma tumoral cysts are more common hemorrhage is more common    spinal intramedullary metastasesusually more sharply circumscribed   transverse myelitis variable contrast enhancement rapidly progressive clinical course    spinal cord contusionappropriate history is usually present   spondylotic myelopathylacks enhancement   multiple sclerosis with spinal involvement most have brain lesions typically located eccentrically enlargement of the cord is uncommon may not demonstrate contrast enhancement   
__label__Gynaecology __label__Haematology __label__Oncology Lymphoma of the uterine cervix is generally uncommon and when it does occur tends to present as cervical involvement with added background multi-organ disease rather than isolated primary cervical lymphoma 1. It is often considered part of the spectrum of uterine lymphoma. On this page:  Article: Epidemiology Clinical presentation Pathology Radiographic features Treatment and prognosis  Related articles References   Images:Cases and figures  EpidemiologyIn the western world, cervical lymphoma is thought to account for 0.008% of primary cervical tumors and 1-2% of extranodal lymphoma 2,3. It is, however, the most common site of lymphoma (primary or secondary) in the female genital tract.While the age at presentation ranges widely can from 20-80 years, the median age is closer to 40-60 years 1.Clinical presentationCommon symptoms include vaginal bleeding, perineal discomfort and/or vaginal discharge. Patients may also present with an asymptomatic pelvic mass.PathologyCervical cytology is often normal as these tumors arise from the cervical stroma, and the squamous epithelial lining is preserved initially. A deep cervical biopsy is essential for diagnosis.Radiographic featuresGeneralDiffuse uterine enlargement is the most common appearance. Less commonly, there may be a polypoidal or multinodular mass or a submucosal mass mimicking leiomyoma. In patients with multiorgan disease, the pattern of change may be typical of lymphoma, allowing a confident pre-biopsy diagnosis.CTConsidered non-specific on CT and can have similar findings to other pelvic malignancies 6. CT may have a place in assessing the extent of disease within the abdomen, pelvis and beyond.MRIAs with uterine lymphoma in general MR imaging features non-specific and can at times closely resemble that of adenocarcinoma of the cervix.Lesions can be large while signal within the tumor is thought to be relatively homogeneous.It has been reported that cervical lymphoma is best defined on T2 weighted images or contrast-enhanced T1 weighted images.Signal characteristics include:  T1: generally tends to be hypointense 2   T2: generally tends to be hyperintense 2  MR imaging findings of a preserved cervical epithelium in the presence of extensive involvement of the cervical stroma may also be a suggestive feature 2.Treatment and prognosis Cervical lymphoma is usually treated with chemotherapy alone or in combination with irradiation or surgery. Prognosis generally tends to be favourable (especially compared with other cervical malignancies).
__label__Haematology The Lymphoma Response to Immunomodulatory Therapy Criteria (LYRIC) represents an adaptation of the Lugano classification for the evaluation of lymphoma after immune-based treatment.During immunomodulatory agents (e.g. checkpoint inhibitors) therapy, imaging findings suggestive of progressive disease (PD) without clinical deterioration may instead represent flare or pseudo-progression, therefore the term “indeterminate response” was added to Lugano classification to address such lesions until confirmed as being true disease progression or not.Indeterminate response (IR)  IR(1): ≥ 50% increase in overall tumor burden (sum of the product of the perpendicular diameters (SPD) of up to six target measurable nodes and extranodal sites) occurred in the first 12 weeks of therapy and without clinical deterioration  IR(2): new lesions or ≥ 50% increase of existing lesion(s) without a ≥ 50% increase of overall tumor burden at any time during treatment.  IR(3): increased FDG uptake of one or more lesions without any increase in size or number of those lesions. If two patterns of IR are present at the same time, priority should be given to IR(1) or (2) over IR(3).After an IR, a biopsy or subsequent imaging within 12 weeks is recommended to confirm true progressive disease versus a flare or pseudoprogression.
__label__Haematology __label__Oncology Many lymphoma staging systems for both Hodgkin lymphoma and non-Hodgkin lymphoma have been developed.The most widely used currently is the Lugano staging classification, which also separately defines criteria for response to treatment assessed by PET-CT or by CT alone. Patients having undergone immunomodulatory therapy may also be assessed by a modification of the Lugano criteria called LYRIC, which introduces the new category of "indeterminate response."ClassificationsEvolution of lymphoma staging and treatment response evaluation criteria:  1950: Peters three part system 8   1966: Rye staging system 7   1971: Ann Arbor staging system   1989: Cotswolds modifications of the Ann Arbor staging system with introduction of the use of computed tomography (CT)  1999: International Working Group Response Criteria: five clinical response categories based on lesions sizes  2007: International Harmonization Project Criteria: CT evaluation with additional use of relative qualitative evaluation F-18 FDG PET-CT  2009: Deauville five-point scale: qualitative evaluation with graduation of F-18 FDG uptake on PET-CT  2014: Lugano classification   2016: lymphoma response to immunomodulatory therapy criteria (LYRIC)

__label__Central __label__Nervous __label__System Lymphoplasmacyte-rich meningiomas are rare histological variants of benign (WHO grade I) meningiomas, characterized by prominent lymphoplasmacytic infiltrates into the tumor, sometimes rendering the underlying meningothelial component inconspicuous. They also have an unusual clinical course (for meningiomas) which instead mimics an inflammatory process 1. Although reported numbers are few, and thus the features of these tumors have not been firmly established, they appear to differ from conventional meningiomas in a number of ways.  On this page:  Article: Epidemiology Clinical presentation Pathology Radiographic features Differential diagnosis Related articles References   Images:Cases and figures  EpidemiologyUnlike the usual meningiomas, lymphoplasmacyte-rich meningiomas are encountered more frequently in somewhat younger patients, without an obvious gender predilection 1. Clinical presentationAlthough the presenting symptom is similar to other intracranial masses (headache - most common, hemiparesis, seizure, dizziness, visual deficits), the course is more acute mimicking an intracranial inflammatory disease. Peripheral blood abnormalities are also detectable, including anemia and polyclonal gammopathy, which normalize following resection 2,4. PathologyAlthough currently considered a variant of meningioma, the exact pathogenesis remains unclear, and whether lymphoplasmacyte-rich meningiomas arise as tumors or inflammatory masses remains to be elucidated 2. In any case, these masses are characterized by meningothelial tumor cells (appearing similar/identical to a typical meningothelial meningioma) with abundant infiltrating lymphocytes and plasma cells 1,3. Importantly, and supporting the contention that these are actually meningiomas with inflammatory infiltrates is that the inflammatory cells are not monoclonal/neoplastic 3. Radiographic featuresDue to the relatively few cases reported it is difficult to make dogmatic statements about the imaging features of these tumors. In many instances they are solitary, resembling other variants of meningioma, but multiple masses have been reported, including involving the spine 4. They can have extensive relatively flat growth, similar to en plaque meningioma, and may have indistinct margins and vasogenic edema in the adjacent brain parenchyma 5. Differential diagnosisThe differential diagnosis for this rare entity includes: other histological variants of meningioma   hypertrophic pachymeningitis e.g. tuberculous pachymeningitis  meningeal metastases meningeal involvement with CNS lymphoma intracranial involvement with Erdheim Chester disease

Fine (25- or 27-gauge) needles are inserted nearly tangential to the skin, 5 to 10 mm from the lesion margin 1. Typically, two to four sites are injected. About 0.1-0.2 mL of tracer is deposited at each injection site, with a total activity of 7.4-37 MBq (200-1000 μCi) 1.To map drainage from the breast, multiple techniques are available, listed here in order of decreasing popularity 2: perilesional (intraparenchymal, peritumoral) injection: on the side of the lesion and generally around the lesion, whether superficial or deep; involving 3-4 mL containing 7.4-111 MBq (200-3000 μCi) cutaneous injection: intradermal or subcutaneous at the skin superficial to the lesion; involving 0.2-1 mL containing 5.55-74 MBq (150-2000 μCi) areolar region injection: injection at the areola rather than at or superficial to the lesion; involving similar volume and activity as the cutaneous injection method intralesional injection: palpation- or image-guided injection into the tumor Images are usually acquired with a planar gamma camera consisting of a large field-of-view detector, parallel-hole collimator, and energy setting appropriate for Tc-99m (140 keV). Dynamic and/or static acquisitions are performed until 45 minutes to an hour after injection, with the use of a cobalt-57 flood source as needed to outline the body 1. Alternatively, in regions of more complex anatomy such as the head and neck, SPECT-CT can be used for cross-sectional delineation.The patient is taken to surgery, during which the surgeon can use a handheld gamma probe to localize the nodes containing the highest activity.

On this page:  Article: Epidemiology Pathology Interpretation Causes of macroamylasemia History and etymology See also Related articles References   EpidemiologyMacroamylasemia is found in ~1% normoamylasaemic individuals and up to 2.5% in those with hyperamylasemia 4. It has been found more commonly in men and the middle-aged but this is based on limited datasets. PathologyMacroenzymes are not uncommon on laboratory assays of human blood. Many proteins self-polymerize or form complexes with other proteins, which are normal constituents of blood, e.g. globulins, carrier molecules, etc 5. The normal amylase molecule has a molecular weight of 45 kDa, but in macroamylasemia the amylase forms a complex with globulin forming a much larger macromolecule ~200 kDa. Normal non-complexed amylase is freely filtered at the renal glomerulus and although most is reabsorbed in the tubules ~25% is excreted in the urine. However, in macroamylasemia the molecule is too large to be filtered by the kidney resulting in a normal urinary amylase despite an elevated serum amylase 3. InterpretationThis condition can be confused with other causes of raised serum amylase (e.g. acute pancreatitis). Macroamylasemia is accompanied by normal serum lipase and urinary amylase levels.  By contradistinction, in pancreatic disease the serum lipase will usually be elevated as well 2.Causes of macroamylasemia liver disease diabetes mellitus malignancy malabsorption autoimmune disorders infusion of hydroxyethyl starch (HES) History and etymologyMacroamylase was first described in 1964 by Wilding.

__label__Musculoskeletal __label__Spine __label__Trauma The Magerl classification, one of many thoracolumbar spinal fracture classification systems, was adopted as the original AO classification in 1994 but has since then been superseded: see the current AO classification of thoracolumbar injuries.UsageAlthough the Magerl classification is based on the three-column concept by Denis and the McAfee classification it has largely been superseded by more modern classification systems (particularly the current AO classification of thoracolumbar injuries and the thoracolumbar injury classification and severity score) whereas the terminology introduced by Denis and McAfee continue to be used in everyday clinical practice. ClassificationThe Magerl classification relies exclusively on CT findings.A: compression injuries  A1: impaction fractures  A1.1: endplate impaction  A1.2: wedge impaction  A1.3: vertebral body collapse    A2: split fractures  A2.1: frontal split fracture  A2.2: sagittal split fracture  A2.3: pincer fracture    A3: burst fractures  A3.1: incomplete burst fracture  A3.2: burst split fracture  A3.3: complete burst fracture  A3.3.1: pincer  A3.3.2: flexion  A3.3.3: axial     B: distraction injuries  B1: predominantly transligamentous flexion-distraction injury  B1.1: with transverse disc disruption  B1.1.1: flexion subluxation  B1.1.2: anterior dislocation  B1.1.3: B1.1.1 or B1.1.2 the with fractures of the articular processes    B1.2: with type A vertebral body fracture    B2: predominantly osseous flexion-distraction injury  B2.1: transverse bi column fracture  B2.2: posterior osseous disruption with transverse disc disruption  B2.2.1: through the pedicles  B2.2.2: through the interarticular portions (flexion spondylolysis)    B2.3: with type A vertebral body fracture  B2.3.1: through the pedicles  B2.3.2: through the isthmus      B3: anterior disruption through the disc  B3.1: hyperextension-subluxation  B3.2: hyperextension-spondylolysis  B3.3: posterior dislocation   C: torsion injuries  C1: rotation-compression injury  C1.1: impaction  C1.2: split  C1.3: burst    C2: rotation-distraction injury  C2.1: with transligamentous flexion-distraction  C2.2: with transosseous flexion-distraction  C2.3: with hyperextension-distraction    C3: rotational shear injury 
__label__Musculoskeletal The magic angle is an MRI artifact which occurs on sequences with a short TE (less than 32ms; T1W sequences, PD sequences and gradient echo sequences). It is confined to regions of tightly bound collagen at 54.74° from the main magnetic field (B0), and appears hyperintense, thus potentially being mistaken for tendinopathy.NormalIn tightly-bound collagen, water molecules are restricted usually causing very short T2 times, accounting for the lack of signal.ArtifactWhen molecules lie at 54.74°, there is lengthening of T2 times with corresponding increase in signal. Thus in short TE sequences, the T2 signal does not decay significantly before the scanner picks up the signal. On the other hand, in long TE sequences (like T2WI), by the time the scanner picks up the signal, T2 signal has already decayed. The reason for this change is due to quantum mechanics: in the set of equations that describe the interaction of spins (their Hamiltonian), there are several terms that are orientation-dependent. Normally, these orientations are averaged over as protons tumble around thermally, but in sites with long-range order these terms can be important. In the case of structured collagen, lots of water binds to the outside of the protein, and therefore exhibits an orientation-dependent effect.Typical sites include: proximal part of the posterior cruciate ligament (PCL)  infrapatellar tendon at the tibial insertion peroneal tendons as they hook around the lateral malleolus cartilage can be affected, e.g. femoral condyles supraspinatus tendon  triangular fibrocartilage complex (if the patient is imaged with the arm elevated) It appears that at 3.0T the effects are reduced.Other non-pathologic causes of high signal within tendons include near tendon insertions, and/or where the tendon normally fans out or merges with other tendons.RemedyTends to occur only on short TE sequences (e.g. T1, GRE, PD), sequences with a longer TE (e.g. T2 including FSE T2) can be used to avoid this artifact.
__label__Hepatobiliary __label__Gastrointestinal Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) is a non-invasive imaging technique to visualize the intra and extrahepatic biliary tree and pancreatic ductal system.It can provide the diagnostic range equivalent to the ERCP and so it can replace the ERCP in high risk patients to avoid significant morbidity. On this page:  Article: Indications Physics Technique and protocols Practical points Related articles References   Images:Cases and figures  IndicationsMRCP can be used to evaluate various conditions of the pancreaticobiliary ductal system, some of which are: identification of congenital anomalies of the cystic and hepatic ducts post-surgical biliary anatomy and complications pancreas divisum anomalous pancreaticobiliary junction choledocholithiasis biliary strictures chronic pancreatitis pancreatic cystic lesions trauma to biliary system PhysicsThe technique exploits the fluid which is present in the biliary and pancreatic ducts as an intrinsic contrast medium by acquiring the images using heavily T2 weighted sequences. Since the fluid-filled structures in the abdomen have a long T2 relaxation time as compared to the surrounding soft tissue, these structures appear hyperintense against the surrounding non-fluid-containing tissues on a heavily T2 weighted sequence and can easily be distinguished.Technique and protocolsNo exogenous contrast medium is administered to the patient.Fasting for 4 hours prior to the examination is required to reduce gastroduodenal secretions, reduce bowel peristalsis (and related motion artifact) and to promote distension of the gallbladder. MRCP is performed on a 1.5 T or superior MRI system, using a phased-array body coil.All protocols obtain heavily T2-weighted sequences. Most commonly obtained sequences are:  RARE: rapid acquisition and relaxation enhancement  FRFSE: fast-recovery fast spin-echo coronal oblique 3D respiratory triggered  HASTE: half-Fourier acquisition single shot turbo spin echo-axial 2D breath hold sequence which provide superior images and can be performed in single breath hold (<20 s) and a fat-suppressed sequence additional sequence which can be acquired to evaluate the duct wall is a fat suppressed T1 GRE sequence For optimal visualization of ducts, acquired images are reformatted in different planes using multiplanar reconstruction (MPR) and maximum intensity projection (MIP).The advantage of FRFSE, as a 3D technique, is the ability to perform multiplanar reconstructions. However, despite respiratory triggering, this sequence is often prone to motion artifact.Technical modificationsWith the evolution of MRCP, modified techniques came into existence. Commonly applied modified MRCP techniques are: secretin-stimulated MRCPsecretin (administered intravenously) causes exocrine secretion of the pancreas, dilating the pancreatic duct and improving its visualization; indications include 1: ​detection/characterization of pancreatic duct anomalies or strictures characterizing communications between the pancreatic duct and pseudocysts/fistulas characterizing pancreatic and sphincter of Oddi dysfunction     functional MRCPintravenous administration of MR lipophilic paramagnetic contrast agents which are then excreted by the hepatobiliary system  negative oral contrast to 'null' the duodenum commercially available agents natural products which are rich in manganese (e.g. pineapple or blueberry juice) shorten the T2 relaxation time   Practical pointsArtifacts related to technique and reconstruction, and motion or susceptibility artifacts due to metal clips and gas, may give rise to poor spatial resolution and limited interpretation.
__label__Oncology __label__Haematology Magnetic resonance lymphangiography (MRL) is an imaging technique used to visualize and map the lymphatic vessels. The technique is used for treatment planning in supermicrosurgical procedures, including lymphaticovenous anastomosis, lymphaticolymphatic bypass and vascularized lymph node transfers. The technique requires an MRI with a field strength of 1.5 T or greater and access to a multielement coil. Both phased-array peripheral vascular coils and body array coils are reported to provide good signal-to-noise ratios 1. A 0.1 mmol/kg body weight dose mixture of gadobenate dimeglumine and 1% lidocaine is injected intradermally or subcutaneously in the region of interest. The patient is subsequently imaged using a 3D fast spoiled gradient-echo T1-weighted sequence with a fat-saturation technique to facilitate visualization of the lymphatics. Subtraction of a precontrast study from a post-contrast study has also been reported in literature as a method to increase the apparent contrast in the examination 1.
__label__Musculoskeletal __label__Spine Magnetic resonance neurography (MRN) is a relatively new non-invasive imaging technique for dedicated assessment of peripheral nerves.It is used to assess peripheral nerve entrapments and impingements as well as localization and grading of nerve injuries and lesions.Dedicated high-resolution MR sequences are utilized to optimally increase the conspicuity of nerve tissue signal. Exact parameters, planes and reconstructions will vary according to anatomical location, scanner constraints and local preference. Commonly used imaging protocols include 1-4: axial T1-weighted axial fat-suppressed T2-weighted 3D STIR (short tau inversion-recovery) 3D PSIF (reversed fast imaging in steady state precession) Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and high-resolution balanced steady-state sequences (e.g. 3D CISS) may also be useful 4. Use of intravenous gadolinium contrast is usually restricted for assessment of infection, perineural involvement by tumor of to further assess mass lesions.
__label__Central __label__Nervous __label__System Magnetic resonance parkinsonism index (MRPI) can be used in MRI studies to predict the presence of progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) in patients with clinically unclassifiable parkinsonism.MRPI is calculated by measuring the width of the superior cerebellar peduncle in the coronal plane, the middle cerebellar peduncle in the sagittal plane and the area of the midbrain and pons in the midsagittal plane. It is calculated by multiplying the pons area to midbrain area ratio by the middle cerebellar peduncle width to superior cerebellar peduncle width ratio 1-2:(P / M) x (MCP / SCP) MCP = width of middle cerebellar peduncle SCP = width of superior cerebellar peduncle P = area of pons in midsagittal plane M = area of midbrain in midsagittal plane A value of more than 13.55 indicates an abnormal result, and strongly suggests that these patients will go on to develop PSP. One study found that 78.5% of patients with clinically unclassifiable parkinsonism who had abnormal MRPI went on to fulfill criteria for PSP at two years following that measurement 2. NB: midbrain to pons area ratio has also been used to help in the diagnosis of PSP.  
__label__Breast A magnification view in mammography is performed to evaluate and count microcalcifications and its extension (as well the assessment of the borders and the tissue structures of a suspicious area or a mass) by using a magnification device which brings the breast away from the film plate and closer to the x-ray source. This allows the acquisition of magnified images (1.5x to 2x magnification) of the region of interest.

__label__Urogenital A maiden waist deformity is a name given to the appearance when there is medial deviation of both ureters. This typically occurs in retroperitoneal fibrosis. In this condition, there is medial indrawing of the ureters due to deposition of fibrous tissue in the retroperitoneum at the level of the lumbosacral junction. Due to involvement of both ureters, the course of the medially-drawn ureters is said to have the appearance of the narrow waist of a maiden, thus giving it its name.

__label__Musculoskeletal __label__Trauma Maisonneuve fracture refers to a combination of a fracture of the proximal fibula together with an unstable ankle injury (widening of the ankle mortise on x-ray), often comprising ligamentous injury (distal tibiofibular syndesmosis, deltoid ligament) and/or fracture of the medial malleolus. It is caused by a pronation-external rotation mechanism. On this page:  Article: Radiographic features Treatment and prognosis History and etymology Related articles References   Images:Cases and figures  Radiographic featuresPlain radiographAnkle views may show a fracture of the medial malleolus or widening of the medial ankle joint space due to deltoid ligament injury, as well as widening of the distal tibiofibular syndesmosis.

__label__Central __label__Nervous __label__System Major depressive disorder (MDD) is the most common psychiatric disorder in both developed and developing countries. It is characterized by a persistently low mood and a reduced interest in previously pleasurable activities.  On this page:  Article: Epidemiology Clinical presentation Radiographic features Treatment and prognosis Practical points References   Images:Cases and figures  EpidemiologyThe 12-month prevalence of major depressive disorder in the general population is estimated at ~26%, while the lifetime prevalence is estimated at 24%. Risk factors family history of major depressive disorder 1  history of alcohol dependence 1  >65 years old 1  lower educational background 1  unmarried patients 1  Clinical presentationThe Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-V) recognizes the following criteria for the diagnosis of major depressive disorder (must be present for at least 2 weeks): low mood decreased interest in pleasurable activities (anhedonia) poor sleep poor appetite decreased energy  decreased libido difficulty in concentration psychomotor retardation thoughts of suicide thoughts around guilt or hopelessness These symptoms must not be attributable to an organic cause or substance use. In the elderly, major depressive disorder can mimic early dementia as it often presents with reduced memory and psychomotor retardation. This is often termed pseudodementia. In young children, angry outbursts and poor performance in school may be the first signs of major depression 2. Laboratory tests elevated inflammatory markers e.g. C-reactive protein (CRP), IL-6, TNF 7 Radiographic featuresAlthough the diagnosis of major depressive disorder is made clinically, there are a number of imaging findings observed in brain imaging. CT and MRIImaging reveals lower thalamic volumes in patients presenting with the first episode of major depressive disorder. This trend was consistent with patients presenting with multiple episodes. Younger patients tend to also have lower hippocampal volumes in conjunction with lower thalamic volumes. This is an important finding as it demonstrates the negative effect of high glucocorticoid concentrations (which are elevated in MDD) on the hippocampus. However, it is important to note that studies have not been able to demonstrate any association between thalamic and hippocampal volumes and severity of MDD 3,4. Some studies have shown an increase in the size of the amygdala in patients with MDD. There appears to be a correlation between the size of the amygdala and the severity of symptoms 5. fMRISeveral studies have shown increased activity in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), which is predominantly implicated in allostasis. There appears to be reduced communication between the ACC and the amygdala, the pallidostriatum and the medial thalamus, suggesting a decreased regulatory effect of the ACC over the mood-regulating limbic areas. There is a reduction in communication between the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) and the caudate which could suggest abnormalities in the reward pathway 6. Treatment and prognosisThe treatment of depression depends on the severity of the disease, but broadly involves the use of antidepressants and psychotherapy; electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is usually reserved for cases refractory to pharmacological agents. Recent work suggests that NSAIDs may be a useful adjunct therapy for major depressive disorder 7.Currently, imaging findings are not used to guide treatment/prognosis. Practical points depression is the most common psychiatric disorder worldwide with the rise of individualized medicine, functional imaging of the brain may become important in the future for evaluating the severity of the disease and potential treatment options for patients

Other risk factors include immunosuppression, AIDs and diabetes mellitus. Clinical presentationPresenting symptoms depend on the region involved.In the most common setting, when the bladder is the site of diseases, patients present with gross hematuria, lower urinary tract symptoms and recurrent urinary tract infection (most commonly with Escherichia coli ). Papules, plaques and ulceration on direct visualization during flexible cystoscopy have been described 5. PathologyIn the urinary system, although infection with E. coli is very often observed, impaired host bactericidal defenses and defective phagocytosis are considered an important part of the pathogenesis 1. HistologyVon Hansemann cells (ovoid histiocytes) which contain calcific Michaelis-Gutmann bodies are a histologic hallmark 2,5. Identification may require special stains.LocationThe urinary bladder is the most frequently affected organ (40% of patients with malacoplakia).Radiographic featuresImaging characteristics of malacoplakia are varied and depend on the region involved.Urinary systemMalacoplakia is most commonly observed within the bladder, although plaques may also occur in the ureters.It may present as multiple, polypoid, vascular, solid masses or as circumferential wall thickening, associated with vesicoureteral reflux and dilatation of the upper urinary tract. These masses vary in size from a few millimeters to several centimeters. Occasionally, malacoplakia can be locally aggressive and invades surrounding structures even causing bone erosions 1.  Treatment and prognosisAlthough malacoplakia may be extremely aggressive, invading the adjacent spaces and even causing bone destruction, non-surgical medical management is the mainstay of treatment. As such, biopsy for accurate diagnosis is essential. Treatment of urinary involvement usually includes antibiotics, ascorbic acid, and a cholinergic agonist 1.History and etymologyThe term derives from "μαλακία" (malakia: "soft") and "μαλακία" (plakia: "slab/plaque").The terms "malaco"plakia and "malako"plakia are used interchangeably as latinisations of "μαλακία".The term was first used by Von Hansseman, but the condition was first described by Michaelis and Gutmann in 1902 1.Differential diagnosisThe differential will vary greatly depending on the location of involvement. Urinary system transitional cell carcinoma  tuberculous urethritis multifocal or long-segment strictures calcification is commonly seen    leukoplakia squamous metaplasia of the urothelium more common in bladder    ureteritis cysticareactive proliferative changes of the urothelium causing multiple small subepithelial cysts

On this page:  Article: Clinical presentation Pathology Radiographic features History and etymology See also Related articles References   Images:Cases and figures  Clinical presentationOne of the clinical features is shortening of the leg on the affected side.PathologyIt comprises of two ipsilateral pelvic ring fractures, which are vertically oriented: anterior to the acetabulum posterior to the acetabulum Most commonly there is disruption of the ipsilateral superior and inferior pubic rami and sacroiliac joint. Common variants involve the ilium or sacral wing rather than the sacroiliac joint. This results in an unstable lateral fragment, which contains the acetabulum.AssociationsDiastasis of the pubic symphysis may coexist.Radiographic featuresPlain radiographAP radiograph of the pelvis will generally demonstrate this pattern of injury. Additional inlet and outlet views can be performed to further demonstrate displacement of the hemipelvis. There is commonly cephalad displacement of the hemipelvis.History and etymologyIt is named after Joseph-François Malgaigne (1806-1865), a French surgeon.See alsolower extremity fractures

It will identify biliary duct dilatation and be able to assess the level of obstruction.In many cases, it will be able to identify the obstructing lesion as a mass rather than a gallstone. CTCT with contrast will give more anatomic information than the ultrasound. It will help confirm the location of the mass lesion and identifying where the lesion has arisen. CT is very useful for mapping the vascular supply around tumors which is invaluable when planning surgical options. It may also be useful for local staging and potentially for identifying any metastatic disease.MRIMRI may be used to assess the level of obstruction (MRCP) and can be used to characterize liver lesions.PTC and drainageA percutaneous transhepatic cholangiogram allows a radiologist to access the dilated biliary tree from above the level of obstruction and decompress the system. Depending on the cause and completeness of obstruction, this may be considered as a temporising measure while the treatment plan is determined.

Most women are post-menopausal at the time of presentation and usually between their 6th to 8th decades of life.Clinical presentationPatients often present with an abdominal mass, ascites, and anemia. As with other ovarian tumors, the presentation can be vague.PathologyMMMT are histologically biphasic tumors with both carcinomatous (epithelial) and sarcomatous (stromal) elements.Radiographic featuresOn imaging, it is not possible to differentiate carcinosarcomas from other ovarian neoplasms and therefore the diagnosis is essentially based on histopathologic findings.

Approximately half of such tumors are seen in individuals with neurofibromatosis type I (NF1), in such cases arising from pre-existing neurofibromas.  On this page:  Article: Epidemiology Clinical presentation Pathology Radiographic features Treatment and prognosis References   Images:Cases and figures  EpidemiologyMalignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors are estimated to account for 5-10% of all soft-tissue sarcomas. They typically present in young and middle-aged adults 8. There is no recognized gender predilection. When seen in the setting of NF1, they tend to occur in younger patients 8. They are also encountered with greater frequency in individuals who have previously received radiotherapy 8. Clinical presentationClinical presentation varies dependent on location. PathologyMPNSTs can either arise de-novo or de-differentiate from an existing neurofibroma (most often plexiform neurofibromas in NF1) or rarely other neurogenic tumors (e.g schwannoma, ganglioneuroblastoma, ganglioneuroma, pheochromocytoma) 8. LocationMPNSTs usually arise from a large nerve, and thus usually occur close to a plexus (e.g. sacral plexus/brachial plexus). Cranial nerves are rarely involved, and on the rare occasions they are, then the MPNST has usually arisen from an underlying schwannoma rather than a neurofibroma 8.GeneticsMost MPNSTs demonstrate inactivation of a number of genes: NF1, CDKN2A and PRC2 8. Macroscopic appearanceThe macroscopic appearance depends both on location and on whether or not the MPNST has arisen from an underlying pre-existing tumor. They are often large (>5 cm) at diagnosis, and may demonstrate local infiltration into surrounding tissues 8. Microscopic appearanceThe microscopic appearance of MPNSTs is heterogeneous, varying in cellularity and growth pattern, generally including tightly packed spindle cells arranged in either a herringbone or interwoven fasciculated pattern 8. ImmunophenotypeImmunohistochemistry reflects their neurogenic origin, with the following immunoreactivity 8:   S100: positive in 50-70% - low in high-grade MPNSTs  p53 protein: positive in 75%  EGFR: positive in ~35% VariantsA number of histological variants are recognized 8: epithelioid MPNST MPNST with divergent differentiation (aka malignant triton tumor) MPNST with perineural differentiation (aka malignant perineurioma) Radiographic featuresImaging criteria are generally considered unreliable in differentiating from a more benign neurofibroma or schwannoma 4.

__label__Gastrointestinal __label__Oncology Malignant peritoneal mesothelioma is an uncommon primary tumor of the peritoneal lining. It shares epidemiological and pathological features with - but is less common than - its pleural counterpart, which is described in detail in the general article on mesothelioma. Other abdominal subtypes (also discussed separately) include: multicystic mesothelioma tunica vaginalis testis mesothelioma  On this page:  Article: Epidemiology Clinical presentation Pathology Radiographic features Treatment and prognosis Differential diagnosis See also References   Images: Cases and figures Imaging differential diagnosis   EpidemiologyApproximately 20-30% of all mesotheliomas arise from the peritoneal serosal lining. As with pleural mesothelioma, there is also a strong association with asbestos exposure (primarily the crocidolite variety), and this occupational hazard probably accounts for disease predominance in middle-aged to older males (most common age group is 50 to 70 years and it may also account for the slightly increased male predilection).Despite this, ~50% of cases have no history of exposure to asbestos, although prior radiation exposure, exposure to thorium, talc, erionite or mica, as well as in patients affected by familial Mediterranean fever and diffuse lymphocytic lymphoma have also been reported.The overall incidence is approximately 1-2 cases per million.Clinical presentationTypically patients present with weight loss, anorexia, abdominal pain and/or abdominal distension, pyrexia of unknown origin.There can be symptoms associated with hypercoagulability particularly due to a paraneoplastic syndrome associated with mesothelioma.There is a reported correlation between the clinical presentation and CT findings, with subgrouping into 2:  dry-painful type: presenting with abdominal pain, CT features of peritoneal mass(es) and little to no ascites   wet type: presenting with abdominal distension, CT findings of ascites and widespread nodules without a predominant mass  mixed type: both pain and ascites present PathologyAs with pleural mesothelioma, three histologic subtypes exist: epithelial (most frequent) sarcomatoid biphasic (mixed epithelial-sarcomatoid) Radiographic featuresUltrasound variable sonographic appearances, from sheet-like hypoechoic to echogenic masses 1,4  omental thickening ascites CTCT is useful for the detection, characterization, staging, and guiding biopsy of peritoneal masses.

A tumor diameter of 3 cm or greater has been generally reported to be associated with a higher likelihood of malignancy 3.Treatment and prognosisFewer than 20% of the malignant tumors metastasize. When metastatic disease does occur, the metastases usually spread haematogenously to the lungs, pleura, or bone. Surgery is the mainstay of treatment as they are not proven to be sensitive to radiotherapy or chemotherapy. Because lymphatic metastasis is rare, axillary nodal surgery is not indicated.
__label__Chest __label__Oncology Malignant pleural disease usually heralds a poor prognosis, whether it represents a primary pleural malignancy or metastatic involvement.  On this page:  Article: Clinical presentation Pathology Radiographic features Treatment and prognosis Differential diagnosis References   Images:Cases and figures  Clinical presentationClinical presentation is variable. Patients may be asymptomatic or have pleuritic pain. If associated with a sizeable pleural effusion, then respiratory compromise may be evident. If a tumor is from the chest wall, then musculoskeletal pain or even a palpable mass may be present.PathologyThe pleura can be involved by malignancy by three main mechanisms: direct extension from an adjacent tumor, e.g. bronchogenic carcinoma  a primary tumor, e.g. mesothelioma, primary pleural lymphoma  pleural metastases In each of these, the manifestation can be either solid disease or a malignant pleural effusion, or a combination of both. The relative etiology is 1,6:  metastatic carcinoma (e.g. primary lung): 58%  mesothelioma: 28%  non-Hodgkin lymphoma: 8% breast leukemia  metastatic melanoma  liposarcoma invasive thymoma  rare primary pleural malignancies 7 epithelioid angiosarcoma epithelioid hemangioendothelioma synovial sarcoma pleuropulmonary blastoma desmoplastic small round cell tumor of the pleura   Radiographic featuresConventional imaging is in general highly specific for the diagnosis of pleural malignancy but unfortunately lacks sensitivity 3. Plain radiographPlain films in the setting of malignant pleural effusion are insensitive at distinguishing it from a benign effusion. See malignant vs benign pleural effusionIn cases where multiple nodular regions or pleural thickening are present the diagnosis may be evident, especially if a primary tumor or other metastatic deposits are visible.CTCT is the work-horse of pleural imaging, able to achieve specificities of close to 100% 3. The portal-venous phase is optimal for demonstrating pleural enhancement, rather than arterial phase imaging used routine thoracic CT. A number of features are recognized, including 1,3: circumferential pleural thickening nodular pleural thickening parietal pleural thickening greater than 1 cm mediastinal pleural involvement  pleural calcification generally suggests a benign process In many cases the primary malignancy will be visible (e.g. breast cancer, bronchogenic cancer) and/or evidence of pulmonary or bony metastases will be visible. Nuclear medicineFDG-PET is far more sensitive than conventional imaging in diagnosing malignant pleural disease and distinguishing them from benign processes 3. Hypermetabolism can be seen in either the pleura or pleural effusion. Although both benign and malignant processes, benign processes rarely increase the SUV over 2.0 3. MRIMRI findings of high signal intensity on T2 in relation to intercostal muscles and/or contrast-enhanced on T1 images together with CT morphology has a 100% and a specificity of 93% in the detection of pleural malignancy 5.Treatment and prognosisBoth treatment and prognosis are dependent on the underlying type of malignancy. In the case of primary malignancies of the pleura (e.g. mesothelioma) resection may be a possibility in highly selected cases.Thoracentesis of malignant pleural effusions has limited effect with reaccumulation occurring, on average, at four days. In general, and certainly in the case of diffuse pleural metastatic disease, systemic therapies or radiotherapy are the only options. These are discussed separately as part of articles pertaining to individual malignancies: mesothelioma bronchogenic carcinoma breast carcinoma invasive thymoma lymphoma Differential diagnosisDifferential diagnosis depends on the predominant form the pleural disease takes: differential of nodular pleural thickening differential of a pleural effusion differential of a single pleural mass

__label__Musculoskeletal __label__Trauma Mallet finger refers to injuries of the extensor mechanism of the finger at the level of the distal interphalangeal joint (DIP). They are the most prevalent finger tendon injury in sport. They may represent an isolated tendinous injury or occur in combination with an avulsion fracture of the dorsal base of the distal phalanx. On this page:  Article: Clinical presentation Pathology Radiographic features Treatment and prognosis Related articles References   Images:Cases and figures  Clinical presentationIt is characterized by an inability to extend the finger at the distal interphalangeal (DIP) joint. There is slight flexion at this joint, which is where the term "mallet" comes from - the finger position resembles a mallet (for example, a piano key mallet).The injury classically occurs while playing sports where the DIP undergoes sudden flexion (extended finger is struck at the tip by an object, e.g. baseball, basketball), or a crush injury (slamming a door towards the distal interphalangeal joint) in the extensor direction. PathologyThe DIP joint is extended by combined pulling force of the terminal (lateral bands) of the extensor tendon, functioning together with the oblique retinacular ligament 7. Injury to these structures commonly results from direct axial or flexion loading of the DIP joint, as can occur by direct blow from a ball.The terminal extensor tendon inserts on the DIP joint capsule, and so injurious force may also result in intra-articular avulsion fracture of the base of the distal phalanx. This may represent an epiphyseal injury in skeletally-immature children 7.Radiographic featuresPlain radiographIf there is a bony avulsion, a plain film will classically show a triangular avulsion fragment at the insertion of the common extensor tendon on the dorsal aspect of the distal phalanx at the DIP joint.A high proportion of mallet finger injuries will present as isolated tendon injuries without any associated avulsions fractures known as a "mallet fracture" 5.UltrasoundThe findings on ultrasound include 6: loss of real-time movement of the tendon complete or partial extensor tendon tears fluid in the region of the extensor tendon insertion avulsion fracture Treatment and prognosisThe preferred treatment for closed mallet injuries is non operative treatment, using a splint to maintain the DIP joint in extension or slight hyperextension - the proximal interphalangeal joint (PIP) is kept mobile. This positioning causes approximation of the injured tendon ends, which usually heals by scarring over time and restores extension 7. Non operative treatment would usually involve 6 weeks of full time splinting followed by 6 weeks of night splinting 8. It is also important to note that the DIP joint should be kept in full extension for the entire first 6 week period including times of hygiene. It is uncommon for closed mallet finger injuries to require surgical intervention 5. Surgery is considered for avulsion fracture where the fragment is larger than 1/3 of the joint surface and there is more than 2 mm of displacement or there is volar subluxation of the distal phalanx which is not reducible in a splint.The fragment may be pinned with Kirschner wire (either percutaneously or following open reduction) or indirectly reduced by "door stop" technique with the DIP flexed and stabilizing Kirschner wire placed through the middle phalanx 7. Post-operative complications, e.g. infection or need for further surgery, are common. The alternative is for fixation with a screw or hook plate if the fragments size will accommodateOpen injuries are generally surgically explored to evaluate for additional tendinous injury.Complications the most common complication in mallet finger injuries are dorsal skin complications. This can include dorsal ulceration, nail deformities and maceration of the skin. These complications are prevalent in both operative and non operatively managed cases 8  extensor lag  untreated mallet finger or incomplete healing may progress to a swan neck deformity that will require surgical intervention 3,4,7  development of secondary osteoarthritic changes 4  
__label__Musculoskeletal A mallet toe is a form of foot deformity where there is an isolated flexion deformity of the distal interphalangeal joint (DIPJ).PathologyMallet toe is often attributed to tightness in shoes. There is flexion of the DIPJ initially as a result of direct pressure from the shoe but eventually the flexor digitorum longus (FDL) tendon tightens and contracts, causing the deformity to be more permanent.AssociationsThey may be associated with callosities on the tip of the toe and pressure on the nail.See also mallet finger hammer toe deformity  cross over toe deformity 
__label__Head __label__& __label__Neck The malleus (plural: mallei) is the most lateral middle ear ossicle, located between the tympanic membrane and the incus. On this page:  Article: Gross anatomy Radiographic appearance History and etymology Related articles References   Images:Cases and figures  Gross anatomyThe malleus has a head, neck, and three distinct processes (manubrium (handle), anterior and lateral processes).The head is oval in shape, and articulates posteriorly with the incus by a small facet joint. The facet for articulation with the incus is saddle-shaped, constricted near the middle, and consists of an upper larger and lower smaller part, which form nearly a right angle with each other.The neck is the narrow contracted part just beneath the head; below it, is a prominence to which the various processes are attached.The manubrium (handle) is connected by its lateral margin with the tympanic membrane. It is directed downward, medially, and backward; it decreases in size toward its free end, which is curved slightly forward, and flattened transversely. On its medial side, near its upper end, is a slight projection, into which the tendon of the tensor tympani muscle is inserted.The anterior process is a delicate spicule, which springs from the eminence below the neck and is directed forward to the petrotympanic fissure, to which it is connected by ligamentous fibers. The lateral process is a slight conical projection, which springs from the root of the manubrium; it is directed laterally, and is attached to the upper part of the tympanic membrane and, by means of the anterior and posterior malleolar folds, to the extremities of the notch of Rivinus.Radiographic appearanceCTIts appearance on axial CT is that of a ball of ice cream on a cone, representing the body and short crus of the incus (the ice cream cone sign). History and etymology"Malleus" is Latin for hammer.

__label__Central __label__Nervous __label__System MALT lymphomas of the dura (also known as extranodal marginal zone lymphoma of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue of the dura), are an uncommon form of CNS lymphoma, accounting for an even smaller proportion of dural masses. They are, however, the most common form of primary dural lymphoma. Unlike other CNS lymphomas that are of large B-cell lineage, primary dural lymphomas are related to mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT), and as a result, have an indolent course and far better prognosis. On imaging, they are difficult to diagnose pre-operatively as primary dural lymphomas share many similarities with meningiomas which are vastly more frequent.For a discussion of extracranial disease, see MALT lymphoma.  On this page:  Article: Epidemiology Clinical presentation Pathology Radiographic features Treatment and prognosis Differential diagnosis Related articles References   Images:Cases and figures  EpidemiologyMALT lymphomas of the dura are most often encountered in middle-aged individuals, more commonly in females.

__label__Paediatrics __label__Oncology The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), also known as mechanistic target of rapamycin, are two proteins that are involved in cell signaling pathways implicated in tumorigenesis.The mTOR proteins are serine/threonine protein kinases that combine with several other proteins to form two large complexes (mTORC1 and mTORC2) 1. Regulation of mTOR proteins occurs via a complex balance of stimulatory and inhibitory pathways, with activation resulting in protein translation, cell growth, proliferation, and survival via several signaling pathways 2.Loss of inhibition of mTOR is the basis for tumor formation in tuberous sclerosis. Normally, the hamartin (encoded by the TCS1 gene on chromosome 9q32-34) and hamartin (encoded by the TCS2 gene on chromosome 16p13.3) act as a complex which inactive the Rheb (Ras homologue enriched in brain) protein. In its active state Rheb stimulates mTORC1. Thus, a mutation in either the TSC1 or TSC2 tumor suppressor genes results in overactivation of the mTOR pathway 1.
__label__Breast Mammary duct ectasia is the abnormal widening of one or more breast ducts to greater than 2 mm diameter, or 3 mm at the ampulla. It can be due to benign or malignant processes. On this page:  Article: Terminology Epidemiology Clinical presentation Pathology Radiographic features History and etymology Differential diagnosis Practical points Related articles References   Images:Cases and figures  TerminologySome publications use this term synonymously with periductal mastitis 7 or plasma cell mastitis 10,11, while others suggest that they are distinct entities with a different pathogenesis 8,9 .EpidemiologyIt is more common in females in an age group of 50-60 years (i.e. postmenopausal). It is very rarely seen in males. It can occasionally be seen in children 14. Clinical presentationDuctal ectasia is often asymptomatic, especially when benign. However, patients with ductal ectasia may present with nonspecific breast symptoms: nipple discharge nipple retraction pain/tenderness palpable mass PathologyBenign duct ectasia is characterized by chronic inflammatory and fibrotic changes. Inspissation of debris and secretions within the dilated ducts and later calcification of these ductal contents occurs. There is a known association between ductal ectasia and smoking 12.Intraductal malignancy can also cause duct ectasia.Radiographic featuresMammography dilated linear branching densities in subareolar region variably present rod-like calcifications pointing towards the nipple Ultrasounddistended branching or tubular structures with anechoic contents measuring more than 2 mm diameterMRIOn T1 and T2 weighted images it appears as dilated increased signal intensity branching ducts converging towards the nipple without an overlying mass. Hyperintense signals are due to thick proteinaceous fluid or blood.History and etymologyIt was first described by Haagensen in the year 1951 3.Differential diagnosisFor dilated ducts see: differential diagnosis of dilated ducts on breast imaging.Practical pointsBilateral, subareolar findings of duct ectasia may confidently be assessed as benign (BI-RADS 1 or 2).A unilateral (asymmetric) mammographic finding of duct ectasia without demonstrated stability on prior studies warrants further evaluation with ultrasound 15. Features that on ultrasound should raise suspicion for malignancy include nonsubareolar location, hypoechoic intraluminal contents, ductal wall irregularity or indistinctness, or solid parenchymal mass 9,15.A solitary dilated duct, a rare type of asymmetric duct ectasia, is suspicious for malignancy and biopsy should be considered (BI-RADS 4) 15.

__label__Breast Mammography is a dedicated radiographic technique for imaging the breast.Types of mammographyIn general terms, there are two types of mammography: screening and diagnostic.Mammography differs significantly in many respects from the rest of diagnostic imaging.Screening mammography In general terms, screening mammography is performed on asymptomatic women to identify malignant breast pathology at an early, potentially curable stage. Regardless of confusing statistics in lay publications, the earlier breast cancer is picked up, all other factors being equal, the better the survival rate. Screening mammography is performed on clients, not patients.Diagnostic mammographyImaging performed on symptomatic patients, or to work-up an abnormality found on screening mammography. The objective is to use imaging to typify pathology and arrive at a diagnosis. This is important because different diagnoses have significantly different outcomes and survival rates. For instance, a diagnosis of a simple breast cyst has few implications and does not affect the patient's life expectancy. In contrast, a diagnosis of breast cancer has significant implications for the patient and her life expectancy.Differences between the screening and diagnostic environmentsScreening studies are well performed by trained sympathetic staff in environments that are not necessarily located in hospitals. Screening centers function very well as stand-alone locations without a physician on-site. The studies are usually read by breast radiologists and/or breast physicians in an isolated environment. In contrast to the rest of radiology, these studies are read in batches (boards) and in large volumes, and comparison to prior mammograms is vital. Where screening studies are read in environments where interruptions, phones and distractions are present, the risk of mistakes occurring is higher. In many countries, breast cancer screening programs require screening mammograms to be double-read (i.e. two independent breast imagers read the mammogram) with any discordance being referred to a third independent reader. The standard screening views performed are the craniocaudal (CC) and mediolateral oblique (MLO) views of each breast.Diagnostic studies are performed with a radiologist on-site, involved with every step of the imaging procedure. Standard views are supplemented with additional views(e.g. coned views, clevage view, compression view, lateral view, mediolateral view) to further assess the screening-detected abnormality.Why is a diagnosis of breast cancer significant?The diagnosis of breast cancer is significant for many obvious and perhaps less obvious reasons. The diagnosis not only affects the patient, but affects those around her e.g. her female relatives. The disease has a sinister reputation because of the debilitating cosmetic results traditionally associated with surgery and the invariably bad outcome for the patient traditionally associated with the disease.Why is mammography important?Until a cure for the disease is found, mammography is the best tool we have to find breast cancers early i.e. before they are palpable. The result of this is a potential cure for the patient and cosmetically acceptable surgery if required. In general terms, the earlier a cancer is found, the better the outcome. We luckily no longer live in a world of Halsted mastectomies.Why does a breast imager read mammograms?For some strange reason, not all radiologists are "wired" to read breast imaging. The reason for this is unclear. This has nothing to do with capability, intelligence or competency in other fields of imaging. Mammogram readers must have statistically proven, reproducible proficiency to allow them to qualify to read the images and to objectively and independently confirm their proficiency. This is important because of the emotive and potentially disturbing consequences of a significant finding on a mammogram. Unnecessary recalls cost money, do not add value and upset the patient and her physician.Why all the adverse publicity for mammography?It has become politically correct to question the value of mammography. Most of the adverse publicity has a single source out of The Cochrane Collaboration and from one author. The emotion around the disease and its appeal in the lay literature then fuels the publicity which detracts from the scientifically proven value of early diagnosis, improved survival and cosmetically acceptable treatment. A review of the ongoing debate in this regard is out of the scope of this website. Suffice to say that in many respects this is an unfortunate debate driven by people who are not breast imagers and it detracts time, money, effort and attention from the real issue - finding a cure. This debate has many features in common with the infamous debate surrounding autism and MMR vaccination.Criteria for image quality assessment all breast glandular tissue imaged image annotation date patient ID (name and URN or DOB) side markers radiographer ID cassette ID (ideally)   correct exposure - can "bright light" skin and nipple no movement artifact no skin folds symmetrical images Adequate craniocaudal (CC) views all glandular tissue identified nipple in profile nipple in the midline of image length of posterior nipple line (PNL) within one 1 cm in size c.f PNL on MLO images symmetric Adequate mediolateral oblique (MLO) views pectoral shadow is seen down to the level of the nipple or lower inframammary fold is well seen nipple in profile length of posterior nipple line (PNL) within one 1 cm in size c.f PNL on CC images symmetric 
__label__Breast There are numerous mammography views that can broadly be split into two groups standard views  supplementary views - additional information or problem solving Standard viewsStandard views are bilateral craniocaudal (CC) and mediolateral oblique (MLO) views, which comprise routine screening mammography. The views are usually used for all routine screening clients. That is, unless there is a contraindication, screening mammograms consist of these 4 views.Not all 4 views are always performed in all mammogram studies.  For instance, in clients under 40 only 2 MLO views may be done to limit radiation exposure, depending on local policy and the discretion of the radiologist.In cases of recent surgery limited imaging may also be appropriate. Where a patient has painful breast pathology or large lesions or an abscess, imaging should be tailored to specific cases and is usually only done after consultation with the radiologist. Common sense should prevail.MLO versus ML The reason is that a mammogram is a two dimensional representation of a 3 dimensional structure; by the same token a map is not an accurate representation of the earth's actual geography. The ML view loses significant tissue volume in the upper outer quadrant of the breast where statistically the most breast cancers are found. By doing an MLO view you get extra tissue without extra exposure. The downside of the MLO view is it is not 90 degrees to the cc view so localization of a lesion requires some thought. The two views are not orthogonal.  craniocaudal view (CC view)  mediolateral oblique view (MLO view) Additional (supplementary) viewsThese views are used in diagnostic breast workups in addition to the standard views.  true lateral view - 90º view   mediolateral view - ML view   lateromedial view - LM view     lateromedial oblique view - LMO view  late mediolateral view - late ML view step oblique views  spot view - spot compression view  double spot compression view magnification view(s)  exaggerated craniocaudal views - exaggerated CC views XCCL view XCCM view     axillary view - axillary tail view   cleavage view - valley view  tangential views caudocranial view - reversed CC view - 180° CC view bullseye CC view rolled CC view  elevated craniocaudal projection  caudal cranial projection  20° oblique projection  inferomedial superolateral oblique projection Eklund technique When to use which view As a general rule, parenchymal asymmetries are worked up with straight lateral (SL) and rolled CC (rolled) views. Calcifications are worked up with magnification views (mag views). The degree of roll does not have to be very significant in most cases. All you are trying to achieve with SL and rolled views is to separate summation shadows from each other. Very often a summation shadow seen on an MLO view will disappear if the very same view is immediately performed.In practice, additional views are always followed by ultrasound if there is a positive finding. The converse is true as well. When doing diagnostic work up on a breast do not be tempted to skip the additional views or the ultrasound. They each add value.

__label__Head __label__& __label__Neck __label__Oncology Mandibular lesions are myriad and common. The presence of teeth results in lesions that are specific to the mandible (and maxilla) and a useful classification that defines them as odontogenic or non-odontogenic. While it may often not be possible to make a diagnosis on imaging alone, this classification is helpful to narrow the differential.ClassificationAlthough a histological classification is probably the most scientifically sound, as radiologists, we are presented with an image, and therefore it is easier to classify lesions according to location in the mandible and their appearance. For a detailed classification of odontogenic tumors, many more than even the keenest neuro/head and neck radiologist can ever remember, please refer to the 2005 WHO histological classification of odontogenic tumors.Below the lesions are divided into cystic and solid. Cystic should not be confused with lytic as solid radiolucent lesions can also appear lytic (see: radiolucent lesions of the jaw).Cystic lesions  periapical cyst (or radicular cyst): common  dentigerous cyst (or follicular cyst of the mandible): common  odontogenic keratocyst (OKC): uncommon primordial cyst of the mandible  Stafne cyst (or static bone cavity): uncommon  solitary bone cyst of the mandible (or traumatic or haemorraghic bone cysts)  aneursymal bone cyst (ABC): rare in the mandible residual cyst of the mandible Solid lesionsOdontogenic  benign  odontoma: most common odontogenic tumor  ameloblastoma: relatively common  odontogenic myxoma (looks just like an ameloblastoma): rare  calcifying epithelial odontogenic tumor (or Pindborg tumor) (looks just like an ameloblastoma): rare  cementoblastoma: rare ameloblastic fibroma  adenomatoid odontogenic tumor: rare condensing osteitis of the mandible    malignant  odontogenic carcinoma (e.g. ameloblastic carcinoma): rare  odontogenic sarcoma: rare  odontogenic carcinosarcoma: rare   Non-odontogenic  benign  cemento-ossifying fibromajuvenile ossifying fibroma  exostosis (or torus mandibularis) osteoma fibrous dysplasia Paget disease  central giant cell lesion/granuloma (giant cell reparative cyst) eosinophilic granuloma neurofibroma schwannoma    malignant  squamous cell carcinoma of mandible: common osteosarcoma Ewing sarcoma chondrosarcoma metastasis  multiple myeloma/plasmacytoma   lymphoma/leukemia  fibrosarcoma  leiomyosarcoma

It may also be seen in inflammatory arthritis (e.g. ankylosing spondylitis).   It is best seen in sagittal and oblique coronal planes 1.
__label__Musculoskeletal __label__Chest The manubriosternal joint, sometimes referred to as the sternomanubrial joint, is the articulation between the upper two parts of the sternum, the manubrium and sternal body.  It is at the level of the sternal angle or angle of Louis, which is at the 2nd costal cartilage and the intervertebral disc of T4 and T5 1. This forms an important palpable landmark for clinical examinationGross anatomyThe manubriosternal joint is a type of secondary cartilaginous joint or symphysis, formed by the inferior border of the manubrium and the superior border of the sternal body. Both sides of the joint are irregular and undulating and covered with hyaline cartilage 2. However, it is not a typical secondary cartilaginous joint as the bones may ossify later in adult life 3.

__label__Musculoskeletal The manubrium is the superior part of the sternum lying at the level of T3-T4 vertebrae. It forms the superior wall of the anterior mediastinum and its superior border also contributes to the superior thoracic aperture (thoracic inlet). The upper border of the manubrium also serves as the apex for the anterior triangle of the neck. On this page:  Article: Gross anatomy Variant anatomy Related pathology Related articles References   Images:Cases and figures  Gross anatomyThe appearance of the manubrium has been described as trapezoidal, a necktie or even a handle. It is a four-sided, flat bone and is broad superiorly. Its width tapers down inferiorly. The concave superior border is called the jugular or suprasternal notch. The smooth anterior surface is transversely convex.ArticulationsThere are two angles on the superolateral corners, the clavicular notches, bilaterally beside the jugular notch. Clavicular notches form the sternoclavicular joints. Immediately inferior to the sternoclavicular joints lie the site for the attachment of the costal cartilages for the first ribs. Along the inferorlateral borders lie demifacets for the second ribs. These demifacets are shared with the body of the sternum.The manubrium articulates with the body of the sternum at the sternomanubrial joint through a secondary cartilaginous joint (symphysis).

__label__Central __label__Nervous __label__System A Marcus Gunn pupil, also known as a relative afferent pupillary defect (RAPD), is a non-specific sign on physical examination that indicates partial optic nerve dysfunction. It is mainly due to unilateral optic neuropathy (e.g. optic neuritis), or rarely optic chiasm or optic tract lesions.This sign is classically elicited on the swinging light test (or Marcus Gunn test). If light is shone into the normal eye both eyes constrict normally and equally. However, in response to light input to the affected eye, both pupils do not constrict to a normal extent, and may be seen to paradoxically dilate as the light moves quickly over it. This occurs because of a decrease in afferent input reaching the pretectal pathway responsible for the pupillary light response in the midbrain via a damaged optic nerve, but efferent fibers to the affected eye are delivered via cranial nerve III.  History and etymologyRobert Marcus Gunn (1850-1909), was a Scottish ophthalmologist 2.

Pylori is often indicated. Locoregional radiotherapy is often first line for low stage disease. If chemotherapy is indicated, rituximab, cyclophosphamide, vincristine and prednisolone (R-CVP) are used. 4See alsoMALT lymphoma 
__label__Chest Marijuana (cannabis or bong) lung refers to the presence of large apical bullae in patients who regularly smoke marijuana. A definite causative link between smoking marijuana and bullous lung disease has not been established, and the association may just be coincidental. PathologySmoking marijuana has been demonstrated to cause chronic bronchitis, airflow obstruction, impaired large airway function and hyperinflation. There is a dose-response relationship to marijuana's effect on the lungs, with one marijuana joint equivalent to 2.5-5 cigarettes, possibly due to different inhalation techniques and lack of filters 1. Macroscopic emphysema is rarely seen although large apical bullae in a paraseptal distribution have been described 1,2 with secondary spontaneous pneumothorax as a complication 3.

__label__Head __label__& __label__Neck Marine-Lenhart syndrome refers to a variant of Graves disease where there are coexistent autonomous thyroid nodules. It is better described as Graves disease with coexistent multinodular goiter or nodular Graves disease 1.  On this page:  Article: Epidemiology Pathology Radiographic features Treatment and prognosis History and etymology Differential diagnosis References   Images:Cases and figures  EpidemiologyThe syndrome is rare with reported prevalence somewhere between 1-4.1% in patients with Graves disease 5,7.PathologyOccurrence of Graves disease, with stimulatory autoantibodies to thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) receptor, with coexisting nodularity of the thyroid gland.Radiographic featuresUltrasoundDepicts both nodules and thyroiditis. Features suggesting thyroiditis are: diffusely enlarged gland diffusely hypoechoic parenchyma markedly increased vascularity, so-called "thyroid inferno" The ultrasound appearances are usually indistinguishable from Hashimoto or de Quervain thyroiditis, however, the clinical picture and blood samples usually make diagnosis straightforward.Nuclear medicineCan be done with Tc-99m pertechnetate or I-123 iodine. Imaging appearances are those of a generally high degree of uptake (as in Graves disease) together with one or more nodules lacking significant uptake i.e. cold nodules.In the course of therapy, along with normalization of TSH levels, these initially cold nodules may alternate their degree of uptake, not infrequently changing to hot nodules 8,9.Treatment and prognosisInitial therapy usually consists of antithyroid drugs. Once thyroid hormone levels are under control, definite therapy options comprise: radionuclide therapy (once malignancy is ruled out) and surgery (which some authors prefer for multiple nodules).  History and etymologyIt was first described in 1911 by the American surgeons David Marine and Carl H Lenhart in Cleveland, Ohio, on histopathological and iodine content studies of goiter. They encountered eight cases of synchronous goiter and adenoma 4,5.Differential diagnosisA list of differential diagnoses for cold nodules comprise both benign and malignant entities, which have been quantified in one larger single-center study 7: great majority comprising benign entities such as: autoimmune changes coexisting nodular goiter   incidence of thyroid malignancy in ~10% of all nodules Scintigraphically-cold nodules with sonographic features suspicious for malignancy are usually biopsied, especially before radioiodine therapy.

__label__Central __label__Nervous __label__System __label__Trauma The Marshall classification of traumatic brain injury is a CT scan derived metric using only a few features and has been shown to predict outcome in patients with traumatic brain injury. This system was first published in 1992 1 building on findings from a large cohort of head injury cases described in 1990 2, and at the time of writing (June 2016) remains one of the most commonly used systems for grading acute traumatic brain injury on the basis of CT findings. The Rotterdam score is a more recent system, which attempts to address some of the recognized limitations of the Marshall system, such as struggling to classify patients who have injuries of multiple types 3-5. It has been suggested that although both systems are valuable in predicting an outcome, as the newer Rotterdam score incorporates additional variable (e.g. subarachnoid hemorrhage) it may be a preferable measure 6. It may be that over the coming years the Marshall system will progressively fall out of favor. StructureThe Marshal system places patients into one of six categories (I to VI) of increasing severity on the basis of findings on non-contrast CT scan of the brain. Higher categories have worse prognosis and survival. It is primarily concerned with two features:  degree of swelling, as determined by midline shift and/or compression of basal cisterns   presence and size of contusions/hemorrhages referred to "high or mixed density lesions" Classification  diffuse injury I  (no visible pathology)no visible intracranial pathology   diffuse injury II midline shift of 0 to 5 mm basal cisterns remain visible no high or mixed density lesions >25 cm3     diffuse injury III (swelling) midline shift of 0 to 5 mm basal cisterns compressed or completely effaced no high or mixed density lesions >25 cm3     diffuse injury IV (shift) midline shift >5 mm no high or mixed density lesions >25 cm3     evacuated mass lesion Vany lesion evacuated surgically   non-evacuated mass lesion VI high or mixed density lesions >25 cm3  not surgically evacuated

Abnormal uterine bleeding, elevated androgens and abdominal distension can occasionally be seen.PathologyThe most probable cause is thought to be recurrent partial torsion of the mesovarium, with obstruction to the venous and lymphatic returns; on the other hand, the basic process may be stromal hyperplasia or hyperthecosis, while the edema is a secondary phenomenon, probably due to torsion of an abnormal, already enlarged organ.Associations Meig syndrome precocious puberty in infants due to MOO has been described in the literature 4  LocationIt is almost always unilateral and in approximately two-thirds of cases involve the right side.Radiographic featuresThe imaging features correspond to the degree of torsion and edema. As MOO is caused by chronic or intermittent torsion, imaging appearances will have some overlap with those of ovarian torsion. UltrasoundMay appear like a hypoechoic, hypovascular solid ovarian mass-like lesion; there is the presence of central increased ovarian stroma, and there are multiple follicles arranged in the peripheral cortex.MRIMRI may also demonstrate an enlarged ovarian mass-like lesion.

__label__Chest A massive pulmonary embolism (PE) represents the most severe manifestation of venous thromboembolic disease when classified on a continuum of hemodynamic derangement. It is usually characterized by an acute pulmonary embolism accompanied by one or more of the following 1,6 sustained systemic hypotension (systolic blood pressure <90 mm Hg) for at least 15 minutes or which requires inotropic supportwhich is not primarily due to another cause, such as left ventricular dysfunction, sepsis, hypovolemia or an arrhythmia  pulselessness persistent and profound bradycardia defined by the presence of a heart rate < 40 bpm associated with signs of end organ hypoperfusion  Massive pulmonary embolism carries a high mortality rate despite advances in diagnosis and therapy.Treatment and prognosisReversal of the associated hypotension and hypoxia with supplemental oxygen and inotropes/vasopressors should be performed to prevent circulatory collapse. As with other forms of venous thromboembolism, anticoagulation is usually initiated 8.Intravenous administration of systemic thrombolytics, such as recombinant tissue type plasminogen activator (rtPA), may be considered. Systemic administration may be preferable to catheter-directed thrombolysis, although this remains controversial. Thrombolytic administration may reduce the clot burden, resulting in an improvement in hemodynamics; however, there is an attendant risk of major arterial bleeding. Absolute contraindications to systemic thrombolytic administration include the following: 7 structural intracranial lesions history of intracranial hemorrhage  recent (within 3 months) ischemic stroke  active bleeding presence of a bleeding diathesis recent spine or brain surgery recent traumatic brain injury Failure of systemic thrombolytics to resolve hemodynamic instability may warrant surgical or catheter-assisted embolectomy. These may also be considered when thrombolytic administration is contraindicated due to an unacceptably high risk of bleeding.Differential diagnosis submassive pulmonary embolismacute pulmonary embolism with either right ventricular dysfunction or evidence of myocardial necrosis without systemic hypotension

__label__Hepatobiliary __label__Musculoskeletal __label__Chest Mastocytosis is characterized by excessive accumulation of mast cells in one or more organs. According to the World Health Organization classification, three clinical entities fall under the mastocytosis umbrella: cutaneous mastocytosis, systemic mastocytosis (with or without cutaneous manifestations), and mast cell sarcoma. This article deals primarily with systemic mastocytosis. On this page:  Article: Clinical presentation Pathology Radiographic features See also References   Images:Cases and figures  Clinical presentationThere is considerable heterogeneity in the presentation of mastocytosis, and in the rate of disease progression. Clinical features include: cutaneous manifestations flushing hypotension and syncope abdominal pain nausea, vomiting and diarrhea malabsorption bone pain and pathological fractures  associated hematological disorders 7  PathologyMast cells are bone marrow-derived cells that are widely distributed in tissues. They store various biologically active mediators, such as heparin and histamine. Mediator release from mast cells has a central role in the development of type 1 hypersensitivity 1. In systemic mastocytosis, abnormal proliferation and microscopic infiltration of mast cells involve the skin, bone marrow, gastrointestinal tract, liver and spleen. It is thought that the effects of mastocytosis relate at least in part to mediator release 7.ClassificationUnder the 2016 revision of the WHO classification of tumors of hematopoietic and lymphoid tissues, mastocytosis is no longer considered a type of myeloproliferative neoplasm due to unique clinical and pathologic features.There are multiple subtypes of systemic mastocytosis with varying clinical courses: indolent systemic mastocytosis (most common) smoldering systemic mastocytosis systemic mastocytosis with an associated hematological neoplasm aggressive systemic mastocytosis mast cell leukemia Radiographic featuresImaging findings are best categorized by the system rather than by modality. Most features are relatively non-specific but may suggest the diagnosis in the correct clinical setting.SkeletalBone involvement in mastocytosis can be either lytic, sclerotic or mixed 4,5.

__label__Head __label__& __label__Neck Mastoidectomy is a fairly frequent procedure performed for a variety of temporal bone pathologies including mastoiditis and cholesteatoma. It involves removing part of the bony wall of the mastoid to aid in drainage and surgical excision.Types of mastoidectomyA number of procedures have been described, commonly divided into "simple", "canal wall up" and "canal wall down" mastoidectomies.Simple mastoidectomyThe lateral wall of the mastoid is removed. The posterosuperior wall of the external acoustic meatus is preserved 1. This approach does not allow visualization of the ossicular chain. Canal wall up (closed) mastoidectomySimilar to a simple mastoidectomy in that the lateral wall of the mastoid is removed and the posterosuperior wall of the external acoustic meatus is preserved 1. Additionally, Koerner's septum is removed which grants access to the middle ear cavity and allows the ossicles to be seen1. Canal wall down (open) mastoidectomySimilar to a canal wall up mastoidectomy in that the lateral wall of the mastoid is removed and Koerner's septum is removed creating a communication with the middle ear cavity 1. The main difference is that the posterosuperior wall of the external acoustic meatus is also removed 1. The tympanic membrane is usually reconstructed. A modified canal wall down mastoidectomy is similar but does not manipulate the ossicular chain or the tympanic membrane. ComplicationsSome of the more common complications include:  infection which may extend to the membranous labyrinth (labyrinthitis)  labyrinthitis ossificans chronic infection recurrent/acquired cholesteatoma  perilymphatic fistula

__label__Obstetrics __label__Gynaecology Maternal hydronephrosis in pregnancy often results as a physiological phenomenon due to the presence of the fetus.  On this page:  Article: Epidemiology Pathology Radiographic features  Treatment and prognosis References   Images:Cases and figures  EpidemiologyIt is estimated that up to 90% of women have some degree of asymptomatic dilatation of the renal calyces, the renal pelves and the upper two-thirds of the ureters during pregnancy 3. It is thought to be most pronounced in primigravid females. PathologyAs the fetus grows, the dilatation usually develops during the second trimester. A mechanical compression of the ureter between the gravid uterus and iliopsoas muscle is generally thought to be the mechanism 5,6,8. Very rarely other entities such as urinary tract calculi can complicate the picture. The prevalence of ureteric calculi in pregnancy is low and is estimated around 0.03-0.4% depending on the population.AssociationsThere may be an association between gestational hydronephrosis and increased frequency of ascending urinary tract infection.LateralityThe dilatation is often more prominent on the right side.Radiographic features UltrasoundWill show renal pelvic and proximal dilatation. In order to differentiate pure physiological hydronephrosis from a worsening of an existing hydronephrosis due to an underlying pathology (e.g. urinary tract calculus), some authorities have devised charts showing the upper limit of normals allowable for gestation.Treatment and prognosisIn most cases, it disappears within a few weeks after birth. The vast majority of asymptomatic cases are treated conservatively 1 especially since most cases of physiological calyectasis do not impair renal function. Ureteral catheters may be introduced in selected symptomatic cases. If however the kidney is obstructed with superimposed infection, prompt surgical decompression is warranted in addition to antibiotic therapy.

__label__Gynaecology Ovarian dermoid cyst and mature cystic ovarian teratoma are terms often used interchangeably to refer to the most common ovarian neoplasm. These slow-growing tumors contain elements from multiple germ cell layers and are best assessed with ultrasound.  On this page:  Article: Terminology Epidemiology Clinical presentation Pathology Radiographic features Treatment and prognosis Differential diagnosis See also Related articles References   Images: Cases and figures Imaging differential diagnosis   TerminologyAlthough they have very similar imaging appearances, the two have a fundamental histological difference: a dermoid is composed only of dermal and epidermal elements (which are both ectodermal in origin), whereas teratomas also comprise mesodermal and endodermal elements. For the sake of simplicity, both are discussed in this article, as much of the literature combines the two entities. EpidemiologyMature cystic teratomas account for ~15% (range 10-20%) of all ovarian neoplasms. They tend to be identified in young women, typically around the age of 30 years 1 and are also the most common ovarian neoplasm in patients younger than 20 years 7.Clinical presentationUncomplicated ovarian dermoid tend to be asymptomatic and are often discovered incidentally. They do, however, predispose to ovarian torsion, and may then present with acute pelvic pain. PathologyMature cystic teratomas are encapsulated tumors with mature tissue or organ components. They are composed of well-differentiated derivations from at least two of the three germ cell layers (i.e. ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm). They, therefore, contain developmentally mature skin complete with hair follicles and sweat glands, sometimes luxuriant clumps of long hair, and often pockets of sebum, blood, fat (93%) 10, bone, nails, teeth, eyes, cartilage, and thyroid tissue. Typically their diameter is smaller than 10 cm, and rarely more than 15 cm. Real organoid structures (teeth, fragments of bone) may be present in ~30% of cases.LocationThey are bilateral in 10-15% of cases 1,2.Variants struma ovarii tumor: contains thyroid elements, however, sometimes these are separately classified as specialized teratomas of the ovariesRadiographic featuresPlain radiographMay show calcific and tooth components with the pelvis.Pelvic ultrasoundUltrasound is the preferred imaging modality. Typically an ovarian dermoid is seen as a cystic adnexal mass with some mural components. Most lesions are unilocular.The spectrum of sonographic features includes: diffusely or partially echogenic mass with posterior sound attenuation owing to sebaceous material and hair within the cyst cavityan echogenic interface at the edge of mass that obscures deep structures: the tip of the iceberg sign   mural hyperechoic Rokitansky nodule (dermoid plug)  echogenic, shadowing calcific or dental (tooth) components the presence of fluid-fluid levels 5  multiple thin, echogenic bands caused by the hair in the cyst cavity: the dot-dash pattern (dermoid mesh)  color Doppler: no internal vascularityinternal vascularity requires further workup to exclude a malignant lesion  intracystic floating balls sign is uncommon but characteristic 9  CTCT has high sensitivity in the diagnosis of cystic teratomas 6 though it is not routinely recommended for this purpose owing to its ionizing radiation.Typically CT images demonstrate fat (areas with very low Hounsfield values), fat-fluid level, calcification (sometimes dentiform), Rokitansky protuberance, and tufts of hair. The presence of most of the above tissues is diagnostic of ovarian cystic teratomas in 98% of cases 5. Whenever the size exceeds 10 cm or soft tissue plugs and cauliflower appearance with irregular borders are seen, malignant transformation should be suspected 5.When ruptured, the characteristic hypoattenuating fatty fluid can be found as anti dependent pockets, typically below the right hemidiaphragm, a pathognomonic finding 2. The escaped cyst content also leads to chemical peritonitis and the mesentery may be stranded and the peritoneum thickened, which may mimic peritoneal carcinomatosis 2. Pelvic MRIMR evaluation usually tends to be reserved for difficult cases but is exquisitely sensitive to fat components. Both fat suppression techniques and chemical shift artifact can be used to confirm the presence of fat. Enhancement is also able to identify solid invasive components, and as such can be used to accurately locally stage malignant variants. Treatment and prognosisMature ovarian teratomas are slow-growing (1-2 mm a year) and, therefore, some advocate nonsurgical management. Larger lesions are often surgically removed. Many recommend annual follow-up for lesions <7 cm to monitor growth, beyond which resection is advised.ComplicationsRecognized complications include:  ovarian torsion: ~3-16% of ovarian teratomas, in general: considered the most common complication rupture: ~1-4% malignant transformation: ~1-2%, usually into squamous cell carcinoma (adults) or rarely into endodermal sinus tumors (pediatrics) superimposed infection: 1%  autoimmune hemolytic anemia: <1% hyperthyroidism (in struma ovarii only)  carcinoid syndrome (rare) paraneoplastic anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (anti-NMDA receptor) associated limbic encephalitis (uncommon) 8  Differential diagnosisGeneral differential imaging considerations include: hemorrhagic ovarian cyst  endometrioma a high T1 signal that does not suppress with fat saturation  T2 shading    pedunculated lipoleiomyoma of the uteruscan be traced back to the uterus   immature teratoma  ovarian serous or mucinous cystadenoma/cystadenocarcinoma  this is usually only a serious consideration if typical features of mature cystic teratoma are absent (i.e. fat is absent) tend to occur in an older age group than dermoid cysts    See alsoovarian tumors

__label__Head __label__& __label__Neck __label__Vascular The (internal) maxillary artery is the larger of the two terminal branches of the external carotid artery. Origin and courseThe maxillary artery's origin is behind the neck of the mandible, at first, it is embedded in the substance of the parotid gland. From there it passes anterior between the ramus of the mandible and the sphenomandibular ligament, and then runs, either superficial or deep to the lateral pterygoid muscle, to the pterygopalatine fossa. It supplies the deep structures of the face.The maxillary artery is divided into three portions by its relation to the lateral pterygoid muscle:  first (mandibular) part: posterior to lateral pterygoid muscle (five branches)  second (pterygoid or muscular) part: within lateral pterygoid muscle (five branches)  third (pterygopalatine) part: anterior to lateral pterygoid muscle (six branches including terminal branch) BranchesFirst (mandibular) partFive branches, each of which enters a bony foramen:  deep auricular artery (enters squamotympanic fissure)  anterior tympanic artery (enters squamotympanic fissure)  middle meningeal artery (enters foramen spinosum)  accessory meningeal artery (enters foramen ovale)  inferior alveolar artery (enters mandibular foramen)artery to mylohyoid  Second (pterygoid or muscular) partFive branches although pterygoid branches are irregular in their number and origin: anterior, middle and posterior deep temporal branches 5  pterygoid branches masseteric artery buccinator artery Third (pterygopalatine) partSix branches including the terminal branch:  posterior superior alveolar artery   infraorbital artery (enters inferior orbital fissure) artery of the pterygoid canal  pharyngeal artery (enters palatovaginal canal)  greater (descending) palatine artery  (enters greater palatine foramen)  sphenopalatine artery - terminal branch (enters sphenopalatine foramen) A long mnemonic to remember these branches is: DAM I AM Piss Drunk But Stupid Drunk I Prefer, Must Phone Alcoholics Anonymous
__label__Head __label__& __label__Neck The maxillary line is a mucosal projection along the lateral nasal wall corresponding to lacrimomaxillary suture externally. The midportion of the line is called "M point". During endoscopic sinus and orbital procedures the maxillary line and M-point are very important and useful landmarks in particular during an endoscopic dacryocystorhinostomy.The maxillary line is a curvilinear eminence along the lateral nasal wall that runs from the anterior attachment of the middle turbinate to the root of the inferior turbinate. This line bisects the lacrimal sac. As it mentioned earlier, it corresponds to the lacrimomaxillary suture, so endoscopist would know that posterior to the maxillary line would correspond to the thin lacrimal bone and posterior half of the lacrimal sac.The M point is approximately 3.9 cm from the nasal sill in women and 4.8 cm in men.
__label__Head __label__& __label__Neck The maxillary ostium or maxillary hiatus is an opening that forms the drainage channel of the maxillary sinus and is also one of the components of the ostiomeatal unit. It is located posteriorly and medially near the roof of the maxillary sinus measuring approximately 2-4 mm. It drains into the posterior aspect of the hiatus semilunaris into the middle meatus of the nasal cavity.
__label__Head __label__& __label__Neck The maxillary sinus (or antrum of Highmore) is a paired pyramid-shaped paranasal sinus within the maxillary bone which drains via the maxillary ostium into the infundibulum, then through hiatus semilunaris into the middle meatus. It is the largest of the paranasal sinuses.

The floor is formed by the alveolar process of the maxilla. The roof is the orbital floor. The posterior wall forms the anterior border of the pterygopalatine fossa.There are several recesses of the maxillary sinus 5: infraorbital recess (superiorly) zygomatic recess (laterally) alveolar recess (inferiorly) palatine recess (variable extension of alveolar recess) Like the other paranasal air sinuses, these can vary in size. Large maxillary sinuses can extend to the alveolar process of the maxilla to the point where the roots of the molar teeth can project into the space.Unlike the other paranasal air sinuses, the opening of the sinus is found on its superior end. This ostium communicates with the nasal cavity via the posterior end of the hiatus semilunaris.Arterial supplySmall arteries from the facial, maxillary, infraorbital and greater palatine arteries pierce the bony walls of the maxillary sinus.Venous drainageVenous drainage anteriorly is via the sphenopalatine vein and posteriorly via the pterygoid venous plexus and the facial vein.Lymphatic drainageLymph from the maxillary sinus drains to the submandibular group of lymph nodes via the infraorbital foramen or the aforementioned communication with the nasal cavity. Innervation superior alveolar nerves  posterior superior alveolar nerves: dental branches pierce the bone to supply the sinus mucosa  middle superior alveolar nerves: supply the pre-molar teeth and overlying mucosa of the sinus  anterior superior alveolar nerves: supplies canine and incisors and anterior wall of the sinus    greater palatine nerveminute branches from this nerve supply the medial wall of the sinus   infraorbital nerveperforating branches supply the roof of the sinus  DevelopmentIt is present at birth and it develops until around the age of 14 years.History and etymologyThe antrum Highmorianum was first described by Nathaniel Highmore (1613-1685), a British physician and anatomist 3.Related pathology  sinusitismore than 70% of unilateral maxillary sinusitis can be attributed to an odontogenic cause 4   retention cysts silent sinus syndrome inverted papilloma antral carcinoma

__label__Head __label__& __label__Neck Maxillary sinus mucoceles are form of paranasal sinus mucoceles. It is considered an uncommon location.PathologyAs with other mucoceles, maxillary sinus mucoceles are believed to form following obstruction of the sinus ostia, with resultant accumulation of fluid within a mucoperiosteal lined cavity. With ongoing mucus production and accumulation within the mucocele, it enlarges gradually, resulting in erosion and remodelling of the surrounding bone.Treatment and prognosisMaxillary mucoceles are slow growing benign lesions but have been reported to be locally aggressive and sometimes cause bony destruction resulting into orbital and dental symptoms 3. Reported treatment options include marsupialisation, Caldwell-Luc procedure and endoscopy 1.
__label__Head __label__& __label__Neck Maxillary tori are analogous to mandibular tori and are composed of densely mineralized bone usually devoid of a medullary cavity. Unlike in the mandible, where they arise on the inner surface, when arising from the maxilla they may project both inwards (in which case they arise from the midline of the hard palate, known as torus palatinus, or inner surface of the alveolar bone) or outwards (from the alveolar bone).

__label__Chest __label__Vascular Maximum Intensity Projection (MIP) consists of projecting the voxel with the highest attenuation value on every view throughout the volume onto a 2D image 1.Such an algorithm is rather simple: for each XY coordinate, only the pixel with the highest Hounsfield number along the Z-axis is represented so that in a single bidimensional image all dense structures in a given volume are observed. For example, it is possible to find all the hyperdense structures in a volume, independently of their position 2.This method tends to display bone and contrast material-filled structures preferentially, and other lower-attenuation structures are not well visualized 2. The primary clinical application of MIP is to improve the detection of pulmonary nodules and assess their profusion. MIP also helps characterize the distribution of small nodules. In addition, MIP sections of variable thickness are excellent for assessing the size and location of vessels, including the pulmonary arteries and veins 1.History and etymologyThe American radiologist, working in Stanford, California, Sandy Napel (fl. 2019) et al introduced sliding thin-slab maximum intensity projection (STS-MIP) as a new technique in 1993 3.

__label__Paediatrics __label__Gynaecology Mayer-Rokitansky-Küster-Hauser syndrome (MRKH), also known as Müllerian agenesis, is a congenital anomaly characterized by vaginal agenesis associated with, in the majority of cases, a spectrum of other genitourinary tract abnormalities. MRKH syndrome belongs to class I Mullerian duct anomalies.Two different forms are described: the typical form (type A) of this syndrome is characterized by the congenital absence of the uterus and upper 2/3 vagina with normal ovaries and fallopian tubes the atypical form (type B) of the syndrome includes associated abnormalities of the ovaries and fallopian tubes and renal anomalies  On this page:  Article: Epidemiology Clinical presentation Pathology Radiographic features History and etymology See also References   Images:Cases and figures  EpidemiologyIt has a reported incidence of ~1:4000-5000 live female births.Clinical presentationClinical presentation is characterized by primary amenorrhea, with normal hormonal levels guaranteed by fully functional gonads. At times cyclic pelvic pain may be present in the post-pubertal period due to an accumulation of hemorrhagic material within uterine buds with a functioning endometrium.PathologyThe anomaly is thought to arise during embryogenesis, with arrested development of the paramesonephric ducts at ~7 weeks after fertilisation.MRKH syndrome is generally characterized by normal external genitalia and absence or reduced development of the uterus and upper two-thirds of the vagina.The fallopian tubes, uterus, cervix and upper ¾ of vagina develop from the Müllerian ducts from the 8th-12th gestational weeks. A developmental defect occurring at this stage leads to agenesis of Müllerian structures. The development of kidneys, ureter, and bladder occurs concomitantly at around the 6th-12th weeks of gestation. The presence of residual components such as a blind vaginal pouch and a rudimentary uterus (non-functioning myometrial tissue), which are noted in a significant proportion of patients.AssociationsThe syndrome is often associated with alterations in the urinary or skeletal system which include:  vertebral anomalies: may be present in ~10% of cases renal anomalies: such as renal agenesis, ectopic kidney, fused kidney, renal hypoplasia, and horseshoe kidney may be seen in 30-40% of patients with the syndrome 4  Radiographic featuresHysterosalpingography Although hysterosalpingography has a well-established use in characterizing uterine Mullerian duct anomalies, it has no place in MRKH syndrome given the hypoplasia/agenesis of the uterus and 2/3 of vagina.UltrasoundUsually there is absence of the uterus and normal ovaries. Also, it may demonstrate any associated renal tract anomaly. MRIIt is the imaging modality of choice after an initial assessment with ultrasound, allowing the characterization of the uterine buds and presence of functioning endometrium within them. History and etymologyIt is named after the German physician August Franz Josef Karl Mayer (1787-1865), Austrian pathologist Karl Freiherr von Rokitansky (1804-1878), German gynecologist Hermann Küster (1879-?) and the Swiss physician Georges André​ Hauser (1921-?) 7,8.See alsoMURCS association

On this page:  Article: Epidemiology Clinical presentation Pathology Radiographic features Treatment and prognosis History and etymology Related articles References   Images:Cases and figures  EpidemiologyOnly 107 cases have been reported in the global literature (as of 2019) 1,3-5,15. The prevalence is ~ 1 in 1,000,000 3 with a strong female predilection (68-84%) 1,3. The age at diagnosis ranges from 35-60 years with a mean age of approximately 40 years 1,3. Childhood-onset has been reported in four cases 3.Recently, in a cohort of 372 patients with fibrous dysplasia 12 and a multicenter cohort study of 1446 patients with fibrous dysplasia 1, Mazabraud syndrome was reported with a prevalence of 2.4 and 2.2% respectively.Associations McCune-Albright syndrome: cafè-au-lait skin pigmentations and endocrine dysfunction, such as precocious puberty, diabetes mellitus, goiter and breast fibroadenomatosis 8 Clinical presentationThere is a highly variable clinical presentation. Patients may be asymptomatic, may describe painless mass(es), or may describe painful mass(es), deformities, and/or pathological fractures 1,2.Intramuscular myxomas are typically located in the vicinity of the bone lesions with both fibrous dysplasia and intramuscular myxomas most commonly affecting the pelvic girdle and lower limbs (75%). The upper limbs are affected in less than a quarter of reported cases. Interestingly, the right side is most commonly affected (60%). The fibrous dysplasia generally occurs between 6.5-10 years prior to the identification of intramuscular myxomas 1.PathologyThere is a strong link with post-zygotic mutations of the GNAS1 gene located on chromosome 20q13.2-q13.3, which encodes the alpha subunit of G-protein (GSa) involved in cell proliferation 1-3. When this occurs, bone is replaced and distorted by poorly organized, structurally unsound, fibrous tissue 2. This mutation affects the mesenchymal precursor cells at the early stages of commitment 3. This may account for the wide range of clinical patterns with earlier mutations proving a more complex clinical phenotype and partly explaining why patients clinically vary from asymptomatic to painful forms with fractures and deformities 3.Microscopic appearance  fibrous dysplasia rimming of osteoblasts is not present around the bone spicules although this change may be focally encountered around areas of adjacent fracture there are bland fibrous tissue and irregular spicules of woven bone 6     intramuscular myxomas lesions are generally hypocellular and hypovascular although areas of increased vascularity and cellularity may be present 14  there are abundant mucoid material and loose reticulin fibers the cells have a stellate shape with small hyperchromatic pyknotic nuclei and scanty cytoplasm there is the absence of nuclear atypia, mitotic figures or necrosis 6    Radiographic featuresPlain radiographPolyostotic (or monostotic) fibrous dysplasia display radiolucency with ground glass matrix appearance surrounded by condensed bone 2. This is usually smooth and homogenous with endosteal scalloping and cortical thinning usually present. Borders are well defined and the cortex is usually intact but thinned due to the expansive nature of the lesion.CTCT is a superior modality to plain radiographs 2. Osseous expansion with ground glass appearance usually attenuates at from 60-140 HU 2. Intramuscular myxomas appear as well-demarcated hypodense ovoid lesions close to areas of fibrous dysplasia and usually show mild diffuse enhancement or peripheral and septal enhancement seen in approximately 50% of cases 9.MRIFibrous dysplasia shows sharply demarcated borders of intermediate to low T1 signal and intermediate to high T2 signal. The higher the number of bony trabeculae, the lower the T2 signal and vice versa - the fewer bony trabeculae, the higher the T2 signal 2.Active lesions show post-contrast enhancement which may be patchy central, rim, homogenous or a combination 2. Diffusion-weighted imaging may help in differentiating benign from malignant lesions and ADC values particularly in the skull lesions correlate with cell density and may narrow differential diagnosis 2.Intramuscular myxomas demonstrate hypointense T1 and hyperintense T2 signal. Four different contrast patterns have been described 10: peripheral enhancement peripheral and patchy internal enhancement peripheral and linear internal enhancement heterogeneous internal enhancement Nuclear medicineTechnetium 99m-methyldiphosphonate can be used to detect disease extent in the young 2. Rapid increase in 18-FDG uptake may suggest the possibility of sarcomatous change 2. Fibrous dysplasia lesions are found positive on In-111 pentriotide (octreoscan), Ga-67 citrate and Tc-99m MIBI scintigraphy as well as 68-Ga-DOTATATE and 11-c choline PET/CT.Intramuscular myxomas may show 18-FDG avidity on PET/CT however nuclear medicine plays no role in the identification of intramuscular myxomas in Mazabraud syndrome 2,11.Treatment and prognosisTreatment is variable and dependent on the extent of the disease. Fibrous dysplasia causing persistent pain, skeletal deformities, and danger of fracture or pathological fracture require surgical intervention. Medical therapy with anti-resorptive medication may be helpful in relieving pain and possibly reconstituting lesions with normal bone 3,8,11. A recent case study described the use of bisphosphonate therapy providing a clear reduction in the diameter of intramuscular myxoma after the use of zolendronic acid for 4 years 3.As myxomas are benign, conservative treatment is recommended 8. Myxomas should be excised if they cause pain, pressure symptoms, and neurological symptoms or interfere with functionality.ComplicationsThe most common complication of myxomatous surgical excision is recurrence which occurs in ~ 30% of cases at a median of 8.5 years (range: 2-16 years) 1. Highly cellular lesions have higher recurrence rates however size, increased number and younger age at diagnosis are not significantly associated with recurrence 1.Rarely, there may be malignant transformation of the fibrous dysplasia 1,2. Malignant transformation of fibrous dysplasia may be to osteosarcoma, fibrosarcoma, chondrosarcoma, and malignant fibrohistiocytoma 2. Seven reported cases of malignant transformation of fibrous dysplasia into osteogenic sarcoma have been reported in patients with Mazabraud syndrome justifying clinical and radiological follow-up 2,15.​No reported cases of malignant transformation in intramuscular myxomas have been identified.History and etymologyThe first case was described in the literature in 1926 4 but it was Mazabraud in 1967 who first recognized the association between the intramuscular myxomas and fibrous dysplasia 5.​
__label__Central __label__Nervous __label__System The middle cerebral artery (MCA) dot sign, also known as the Sylvian fissure sign, is seen on non-contrast brain CT and represents the cross-sectional M2 equivalent of the hyperdense MCA sign. Rather than imaging a length of middle cerebral artery (typically the M1 segment), the dot sign represents a thromboembolism within a segmental branch of the MCA located within the Sylvian fissure (M2 segment). The sign appears when the high-attenuation MCA is viewed in axial section, since the occluded vessel courses in a plane perpendicular to the transverse plane of imaging.PathologyThe MCA dot sign is an early marker of thromboembolic occlusion of the distal MCA branches seen in the Sylvian fissure (M2 segment). The principally affected area of the brain is the insula.Sensitivity and specificityThe sensitivity of this CT sign is approximately 35%, while its specificity may be as high as 100% 3.Treatment and prognosisThe MCA dot sign is prognostic of poor outcome in patients with ischemic stroke, but with a better outcome than the hyperdense MCA sign 2.As such, single studies have assessed the possibility of automated detection 4 and its value in prediction of secondary symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage 5.Punctate vascular calcification along the M2 segment of the MCA within the Sylvian fissure represents a potential mimic of this sign.
__label__Musculoskeletal __label__Spine __label__Trauma McAfee classification of acute traumatic spinal injuries is one of a number of thoracolumbar spinal fracture classification systems and based on the three-column concept of the spine (of Denis). It requires CT for an accurate assessment.UsageThe McAfee classification uses terminology that is understandable to most clinicians, even if they are not aware of the classification system itself. Unlike the more common formal classification systems (thoracolumbar injury classification and severity score (TLICS) and AO classification of thoracolumbar injuries) that have an explicit and precise classification and points schemes, the McAfee classification focuses on useful descriptive terms.  Classification  wedge compression: isolated anterior column compression (see wedge fracture)  stable burst: anterior and middle column compression but the posterior column is normal (see burst fracture)  unstable burst: anterior and middle column compression with disrupted posterior column  flexion-distraction  anterior column compression middle and posterior column: tensile failure axis of flexion: posterior to anterior longitudinal ligament    chance fractures pure bony injuries that extend all the way through the spinal column: from posterior to anterior through the spinous process, pedicles, and vertebral body, respectively (see chance fracture) axis of flexion: anterior to anterior longitudinal ligament    translational fracturesshear force to all the 3 columns (see thoracic spine fracture-dislocations)   
__label__Gastrointestinal McBurney point is defined as a point that lies one-third of the distance laterally on a line drawn from the umbilicus to the right anterior superior iliac spine. Classically, it corresponds to the location of the base of the appendix 1.Clinically, McBurney point is relevant for the elicitation of McBurney sign, which is deep tenderness at McBurney point. This is a key sign in the clinical assessment of appendicitis 1.History and etymologyCharles McBurney (1845-1913) was an American surgeon who located this point and published it in the New York Medical Journal in 1889 1.
__label__Vascular __label__Central __label__Nervous __label__System McConnell’s capsular arteries (MCCA) are one of the three major branches of the cavernous segment of the internal carotid artery (ICA).Gross anatomyThey arise from the medial wall of the cavernous ICA distal to both the meningohypophyseal trunk and the inferolateral trunk.The McConnell’s capsular arteries are divided into anterior and inferior capsular arteries and contribute to the blood supply to the sellar region, in particular, to the sella dura mater and the anterior pituitary capsule 1.Variant anatomyThe McConnell’s capsular arteries are the least constant of the three major branches of the cavernous segment of the ICA and were present in ~30% of autopsy specimens 2.
__label__Cardiac The McConnell's sign describes a regional pattern of acute right ventricular dysfunction on transthoracic echocardiography first observed in a cohort of patients with acute pulmonary thromboembolism. In contrast to the global wall motion abnormalities observed in chronic right ventricular dysfunction, this sign refers to the coexistence of akinesia of the mid-free right ventricular wall with preserved apical contractility 1. Subsequent studies have demonstrated a consistently low sensitivity; in the presence of high pretest probability, it may serve as a useful rule-in parameter at the bedside 2,3.

They were originally introduced in 2001 and revised multiple times (see "previous versions" below) most recently in 2017 5.  On this page:  Article: Criteria History and etymology Previous versions Related articles References   CriteriaThe diagnosis of multiple sclerosis can be made if there is fulfillment of either of these five categories of criteria, depending on how many clinical attacks have occurred 5: ≥2 clinical attacks with ≥2 lesions with objective clinical evidence with no additional data needed   ≥2 clinical attacks with 1 lesion with objective clinical evidence and a clinical history suggestive of a previous lesion with no additional data needed   ≥2 clinical attacks with 1 lesion with objective clinical evidence and no clinical history suggestive of a previous lesion with dissemination in space evident on MRI   1 clinical attack (i.e. clinically isolated syndrome) with ≥2 lesions with objective clinical evidence with dissemination in time evident on MRI or demonstration of CSF-specific oligoclonal bands   1 clinical attack (i.e. clinically isolated syndrome) with 1 lesion with objective clinical evidence with dissemination in space evident on MRI with dissemination in time evident on MRI or demonstration of CSF-specific oligoclonal bands   Dissemination in spaceDissemination in space requires ≥1 T2-hyperintense lesions (≥3 mm in long axis), symptomatic and/or asymptomatic, that are characteristic of multiple sclerosis in two or more of the four following locations 5: periventricular (≥1 lesion, unless the patient is over the age of 50 in which case it is advised to seek a higher number of lesions) cortical or juxtacortical (≥1 lesion) infratentorial (≥1 lesion) spinal cord (≥1 lesion) Notably, T2-hyperintense lesions of the optic nerve, such as those in a patient presenting with optic neuritis, cannot be used in fulfilling the 2017 revised McDonald criteria 5.Dissemination in timeDissemination in time can be established in one of two ways 5: a new T2-hyperintense or gadolinium-enhancing lesion when compared to a previous baseline MRI scan (irrespective of timing) simultaneous presence of a gadolinium-enhancing lesion and a non-enhancing T2-hyperintense lesion on any one MRI scan Primary progressive multiple sclerosis (PPMS)In addition to the above criteria, the McDonald criteria also define the diagnosis of primary progressive multiple sclerosis. The diagnosis now requires 5:  ≥1 year of disability progression which can be determined either prospectively or retrospectively with two of the following: ≥1 T2-hyperintense lesions characteristic of multiple sclerosis in one or more of the following regions: periventricular, cortical or juxtacortical, or infratentorial ≥2 T2-hyperintense lesions in the spinal cord presence of CSF-specific oligoclonal bands   History and etymologyThe criteria are named after Ian McDonald (1933-2006), a New Zealand neurologist, who devised the original criteria with his international colleagues in 2001 1.Previous versionsMcDonald criteria were originally introduced in 2001 1, revised in 2005 2, 2010 3, 2016 (by MAGNIMS) 4 and most recently in 2017 5. The 2017 revision is presented above.Below are summaries of the previous version, that may be useful if reading earlier literature. 2001Disseminated in space3 out of 4 of the following: 1 gadolinium-enhancing lesion or 9 T2 hyperintense brain and/or cord lesions 1 or more infratentorial lesions 1 or more juxtacortical lesions 3 or more periventricular lesions Disseminated in time1 or more new gadolinium-enhancing lesions on a scan performed at least 3 months after onset of initial symptoms and at a new siteOR1 or more new hyperintense T2 lesions compared to a scan performed at least 30 days after onset of symptoms.These imaging criteria are combined with: clinical signs and symptoms CSF oligoclonal bands positive visual evoked potentials 2005In 2005 several revisions were proposed 2 which include multiple spinal lesions may be a substitute for brain and infratentorial lesion criteria, as long as they are greater than 3 mm in size, the length less than 2 vertebral body heights, and the lesion occupies only a portion of the cord cross-section an enhancing spinal cord lesion may be substituted for an enhancing brain lesion for dissemination in time, a new T2 lesion discovery interval may be reduced from 3 months to 1 month 2010Dissemination in spaceDissemination in space requires T2 bright lesions in two or more of the following locations: periventricular (≥ 3 lesions) cortical or juxtacortical (≥1 lesion) optic nerve (≥1 lesion) infratentorial (≥1 lesion) spinal cord (≥1 lesion) Dissemination in timeDissemination in time can be established in one of two ways: a new lesion when compared to a previous scan (irrespective of timing)T2 bright lesion and/or gadolinium-enhancing  presence of an asymptomatic enhancing lesion and a non-enhancing T2 bright lesion on any one scan Primary progressive multiple sclerosis (PPMS)In addition to the above criteria, the diagnosis of primary progressive multiple sclerosis has also been revised. The diagnosis now requires:  ≥1 year of disease progression (this can be determined either prospectively or retrospectively) fulfill the general criteria for dissemination in space 2017 As in previous iterations of these criteria, the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis requires clinical and radiographic evidence 5. The two major changes in the 2017 revision are 5: the early diagnosis of multiple sclerosis can be made in patients with clinically isolated syndrome, demonstration of dissemination of space on MRI, and the presence of CSF-specific oligoclonal bands, without the need for demonstration of dissemination of time on MRI symptomatic and/or asymptomatic MRI lesions, except those in the optic nerve, can be considered in the determination of dissemination in space or time

__label__Musculoskeletal The McMurray test is used to assess the presence of meniscal tears within the knee. On this page:  Article: Background Procedure Evidence History and etymology References   BackgroundClinical tests used for the detection of meniscal tears provide varying levels of diagnostic parameters including sensitivity and specificity. MRI is considered the most accurate diagnostic tool for detecting meniscal injuries while arthroscopy is widely considered gold standard 1. Of the physical examinations available to test for meniscus pathology, the McMurray test is thought to be the most widely used clinically 2. One study found that combining the Thessaly test with the McMurray test improves diagnostic accuracy 3 while another study concluded that combining these tests does not provide overall improved diagnostic accuracy 4.ProcedureThe patient lays supine while the examiner provides varus and valgus stress in addition to internal and external rotation to the patients knee during passive extension. 4,5: the examiner holds the knee and palpates the joint line with one hand, thumb on one side and fingers on the other the other hand holds the sole of the patients foot and acts to support the limb and provide the required movement through range from maximal flexion, the knee is passively extended with internal rotation of the tibia and varus stress the knee is returned to maximal flexion and then passively extended again, this time with external rotation of the tibia and valgus stress Internal rotation + varus stress = lateral meniscusExternal rotation + valgus stress = medial meniscusThe test is positive if there is reproduction of pain, locking or clicking which may indicate a compromised meniscus. EvidenceStudies looking at diagnostic accuracy, sensitivity and specificity have demonstrated varied values. A recent systematic review reported a diagnostic accuracy between 56 - 84% 5. A prospective cohort study of 213 patients found poor sensitivity for medial and lateral meniscus tears of 48% and 65% respectively 6. Conversely specificity for medial and lateral meniscal tears was high, 94% and 86% respectively 6. The positive likelihood ratio for medial and lateral meniscal tears was 8 and 5 respectively 6.History and etymologyThe test was first described in 1940 by orthopedic surgeon Thomas Porter McMurray 7. The original test has been slightly altered with the addition of varus and valgus stress 8.

__label__Chest Mean pulmonary arterial pressure (mPAP or MPAP) can be estimated by echocardiography, although the gold standard remains measurements taken directly during right heart catheterization. It is calculated by the formula:(PASystolic pressure +2 PADiastolic pressure) / 3The pulmonary arterial systolic pressure (PASP) is derived (using the simplified Bernoulli equation) from the peak velocity of the tricuspid regurgitant jet, as measured by continuous wave Doppler, and the PA diastolic pressure from the end diastolic velocity of the pulmonary regurgitant (PR) jet. Alternative methods of estimating the mean PA pressure include: mPAP = (0.61 x PASP) + 2 mPAP = 4 x (PR peak velocity)2 + right atrial pressure (RAP) mPAP = 90 - (0.62 x RVOT acceleration time) mPAP = (mean RA-RV pressure gradient) + RAPderived from the velocity-time integral of the TR jet  Normal MPAP is less than 20 mmHg and considered elevated when it exceeds 25 mmHg at rest or 30 mmHg with exertion.See also pulmonary arterial hypertension tricuspid regurgitation pulmonary regurgitation spectral Doppler right ventricle

The diagnosis of pregnancy failure should not be made on the basis of MSD growth 4.See also small gestational sac
__label__Central __label__Nervous __label__System Mean transit time (MTT) corresponds to the average time, in seconds, that red blood cells spend within a determinate volume of capillary circulation. It is assessed as part of the CT perfusion protocol, which is basically used in the context of ischemic stroke diagnosis and management, and MR perfusion, which has a broader applicability. It is expressed by the formula: MTT = cerebral blood volume (CBV) / cerebral blood flow (CBF)Normal values of MTT in the brain are: gray matter: 4s white matter: 4.8s When the cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) drops beyond the threshold of the brain auto-regulation, the compensatory cerebral vasodilatation, aiming to keep this pressure, becomes overwhelmed (see Monro-Kellie theory), and then the CBF starts to decrease in correlation with the CPP reduction. As a result, MTT will be prolonged. In the beginning, with a mildly reduced CBF, the red blood cells having a long contact time with the oxygen-permeable capillaries will allow an increased oxygen extracted fraction, and this may be sufficient to maintain the cerebral oxygen metabolism ("benign oligemia") 1. However, after a certain point, this will not be sufficient and the brain cells will start to suffer (ischemia).

The infection is transmitted from person-to-person via aerosolized respiratory droplets produced during coughing or sneezing. Approximately 90% of susceptible individuals develop measles after exposure to the virus 4. The measles virus can cause generalized immunosuppression and hence predisposes an individual, particularly those already immunocompromised, to secondary infection such as pneumonia 5.Radiographic featuresThe role of imaging is to detect possible complications.Plain radiographChest radiography may demonstrate mixed reticular opacities, air space consolidation and lymph node enlargement in the hilum 6.CT/MRI the measles virus can affect the central nervous system and cause acute progressive encephalitis, acute post infectious encephalitis and subacute sclerosing panencephalitis 7  in acute encephalitis associated with measles, T2 weighted image shows widely distributed, multifocal high signal lesions in both cerebral hemispheres with swelling of the cortex and bilateral, symmetrical involvement of the dorsal striatum 8  Treatment and prognosisThere are no specific treatments for measles and the treatment is essentially supportive care with antipyretics, fluid therapy, and antibiotics for secondary bacterial infections.Complications pneumonia diarrhea encephalitis otitis media subacute sclerosing panencephalitis Differential diagnosis Kawasaki disease systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) erythema infectiosum rubella sepsis parvovirus B19 infection scarlet fever

__label__Gastrointestinal Meckel diverticulitis is the inflammation of Meckel diverticulum, which is the most common congenital structural abnormality of the gastrointestinal tract 3. Despite this, it is an uncommon cause of acute abdomen and is often not correctly diagnosed pre-operatively. This article focuses on Meckel diverticulitis. For a general discussion of the un-inflamed diverticulum, please refer to the article on Meckel diverticulum.  On this page:  Article: Epidemiology Clinical features Pathology Radiological features Differential diagnosis References   Images:Cases and figures  EpidemiologyMeckel diverticulum is seen in approximately 2% of the adult population and among those with symptoms, males are disproportionately affected compared to females in a ratio of 2-4:1 1,6.Clinical featuresPatients usually present with acute pain in the right lower quadrant. Painless rectal bleeding is also frequent.PathologyA number of mechanisms are recognized as precipitants of diverticulitis. Meckel diverticulitis can occur due to bacterial infection, which can go on occasionally to gangrene. This is similar in pathogenesis to acute appendicitis or colonic diverticulitis. Peptic ulceration due to acid secretion from gastric mucosa (see Meckel diverticulum) or diverticular torsion is also encountered. Radiological featuresUltrasoundMeckel diverticula are usually seen as tubular incompressible blind ending hypoechoic structure with irregular margins. Occasionally it may also be seen as a cyst, raising a different differential diagnosis of intestinal duplication which however is said to have regular margins 2. Doppler may reveal anomalous vessels and signs of inflammation along the diverticulum.CTCT is the main modality employed in imaging patients with acute abdominal pain and signs of inflammation. Meckel diverticula are round or tubular fluid/air filled structures communicating with small bowel with a wall-to-wall diameter of 1.5-6 mm. Mural wall thickening and enhancement are seen with surrounding inflammatory changes in the adjacent fat as well as small reactive mesenteric lymph nodes. Wall enhancement will be absent in gangrenous Meckel diverticulum.Rarely, an enterolith can also be visualized within the diverticulum. As is the case with appendicitis, it is said that contrast opacification of diverticula is suggestive of inflammation. A small bowel obstruction may also be present and in many cases, this is the only pre-operative finding.  Reporting checklistIdentification of Meckel diverticulitis requires not only familiarity with the condition but also a careful examination of the small bowel. If an inflamed diverticulum is identified a number of features should be sought and commented upon, including: diverticulum estimate the distance from the ileocecal junction size/length of diverticulum location relative to the abdominal surface anatomy enhancement/non-enhancement of the wall (non-enhancement suggests gangrene and impending rupture)   appendix: look for signs of inflammation free intra-abdominal gas intra-abdominal fluid/abscess formation small bowel obstruction Small bowel follow-through or CT enteroclysisThey can be used to diagnose morphological Meckel diverticulum, however, sensitivity depends on contrast opacification, and has no role in cases of suspected acute diverticulitis.Nuclear medicine (pertechnetate scan) Ectopic gastric mucosa, if present, can be picked up on this scan, but again does not usually play a role in the acute presentation. Differential diagnosisClinically the differential diagnosis is broad, and unless a Meckel diverticulum is known to be present, Meckel diverticulitis is usually not specifically suspected. Imaging can also be challenging, with the most common differentials including:  acute appendicitisidentifying a normal appendix is thus crucial  terminal ileitis Crohn disease typhilitis infective terminal ileitis   omental infarction  epiploic appendagitis intestinal lumen may be inflamed but retains normal contour rounded fat density nodule with central hyperdense dot    intestinal duplication: usually has regular margins, whereas Meckel diverticula have irregular margins.  
__label__Gastrointestinal __label__Paediatrics Meckel diverticulum is a congenital intestinal diverticulum due to fibrous degeneration of the umbilical end of the omphalomesenteric (vitelline) duct that occurs around the distal ileum. It is considered the most common structural congenital anomaly of the gastrointestinal tract. On this page:  Article: Epidemiology Clinical presentation Pathology Radiographic features History and etymology Related articles References   Images:Cases and figures  EpidemiologyApproximately 2% (range 0.3-3%) 11 of all individuals may have a Meckel diverticulum (see the rule of 2s). While traditionally described to have increased male predilection, it may occur with equal frequency in both sexes although symptoms from complications are more common in male patients 2,11. Most patients with a complication are thought to present in the first two years of life 11.Clinical presentationA large proportion of individuals remain asymptomatic although up to a third of them may experience clinical symptoms 1.  The incidence of complications with a Meckel diverticulum is reported to wide range between 4% and 40% of patients; however, one retrospective study showed the lifetime risk of developing complications of the Meckel diverticulum is 4% up to the age of 20 years, 2% up to the age of 40 years, and zero in the elderly population 2,3,13. There is an increased incidence of the Meckel diverticulum in Crohn patients compared to the general population:  gastrointestinal hemorrhage (melena/hematochezia): most common complication and may account for ~30% of symptomatic cases 2.

However, midline and right iliac fossa location are the commonest. Its level on CT can be either superior or inferior to the terminal ileum 1.Blood supplyarterial supply typically arises from the omphalomesenteric artery (arising from an ileal branch of the superior mesenteric artery)HistologyMeckel diverticula are lined with heterotopic mucosa in up to 60% of cases: gastric mucosa ~62% pancreatic ~6% gastric and pancreatic ~5% jejunal ~2% Brunner glands ~2% gastric and duodenal ~2% DevelopmentIt is considered a remnant of the omphalomesenteric-vitelline duct, which connects the yolk sac to the midgut through the umbilical cord. This duct is typically obliterated by the 5-8th week of gestation. Failure of closure results in: diverticulum (~90% of cases) omphalomesenteric fistula enterocyst fibrous band Radiographic featuresImaging these may occasionally be detected incidentally or may be identified if there is a complication.FluoroscopySmall bowel enemas have sometimes been used for the diagnosis in some centers, although a precise technique is required if the diagnosis is to be excluded with any degree of certainty 4.UltrasoundUsually of limited use in the diagnosis of an uncomplicated Meckel diverticulum. Ultrasound may show a blind-ending peristaltic loop connected to the small bowel.CTCT is of limited value in uncomplicated cases, as the diverticulum may resemble a normal bowel loop. CT may show a fluid- or air-filled blind-ending pouch that arises from the antimesenteric side of the distal ileum.It is possible for the diverticulum to invert and appear as an intraluminal polypoid lesion 12.Angiography or CT angiographyWhen investigated in the context of gastrointestinal hemorrhage, angiography/CT angiography may show the persistent omphalomesenteric artery in most individuals with a Meckel diverticulum although recognition of the artery may be difficult due to overlying vessels.ScintigraphyScintigraphy with 99mTc-Na-pertechnetate has a limited sensitivity (~60%) 2,9; however, it aids in the diagnosis of diverticula with ectopic gastric mucosa. Pertechnetate is taken up by mucin-secreting cells of the gastric mucosa and ectopic gastric tissue. Higher sensitivity may be present in children (~85-90%).History and etymologyIt is named after Johann Friedrich Meckel, who described its anatomy and embryology in 1809 2.
__label__Obstetrics __label__Paediatrics Meckel-Gruber syndrome (MGS) is classically characterized by the triad of:  renal cystic dysplasia: multiple renal cysts (present most cases)  occipital encephalocoele/holoprosencephaly (~70%) postaxial polydactyly: usually hexadactyly (~65%) Additional hepatic developmental defects and hepatic fibrosis may occur. A variety of malformations may be associated with this syndrome but most agree that cystic renal dysplasia must be present with at least one of the other two anomalies in the classic "triad". On this page:  Article: Epidemiology Pathology Radiographic features Treatment and prognosis History and etymology References   Images:Cases and figures  EpidemiologyThe incidence is estimated to be 1:30,000. A disproportionately higher prevalence may be present in Finland, Belgium and in some parts of India. PathologyMeckel-Gruber syndrome shares some features with trisomy 13 and is therefore also termed pseudotrisomy 13 1. Karyotyping is recommended if the above triad is seen on antenatal scanning.Genetics and inheritance It is inherited as an autosomal recessive fashion, the risk of the condition affecting a subsequent child is therefore 25% 1. There is genetic heterogeneity with at least three genes (MKS1, MKS2  and MKS3) having been identified 4,7:  MKS1: on chromosome 17q  MKS2: on chromosome 11q  MKS3: on chromosome 8q or 13 q AssociationsCentral nervous system/craniofacial microcephaly fetal ventriculomegaly agenesis of corpus callosum Dandy-Walker malformation micrognathia cleft lip +/- palate Cardiac/vascular malformations cardiac rotational abnormalities ventriculoseptal defect (VSD) aortic hypoplasia aortic coarctation aortic valvular stenosis Musculoskeletal  webbed neck club foot syndactyly clinodactyly Markerselevated maternal alpha-fetoprotein (MSAFP)Radiographic featuresAntenatal ultrasoundIn addition to the demonstration of the classical features such as an occipital encephalocele, multiple renal cysts and polydactyly, there may be evidence of oligohydramnios (or anhydramnios in severe cases) and microcephaly). In utero (and early neonatal life) multicystic renal disease is usually evident as enlarged echogenic kidneys: demonstration of physical cysts within the kidneys only occurs in the minority of cases.Treatment and prognosisThe condition is almost always fatal at birth either because of pulmonary hypoplasia or neonatal renal failure 3,5. Parents can be counseled appropriately that the subsequent risk is 25%. History and etymologyIt is named after:  Johann Friedrich Meckel (1781-1833) German anatomist (also known for Meckel diverticulum)  Georg Gruber (1884-1977) German physician: who termed it dysencephalia spanchnocystica

__label__Paediatrics __label__Gastrointestinal Meconium ileus refers to a neonatal bowel obstruction of the distal ileum due to abnormally thick and impacted meconium. Unlike in the meconium plug syndrome, the meconium is abnormal in consistency. On this page:  Article: Epidemiology Pathology Radiographic features Treatment and prognosis Differential diagnosis References   Images:Cases and figures  EpidemiologyMeconium ileus is more common in white populations and affects both sexes almost equally.PathologyMeconium found in the intestine of a neonate consists of succus entericus (bile salts, bile acids, and debris from the intestinal mucosa) and is normally evacuated within 6 hours of birth (or earlier).Meconium ileus occurs when meconium becomes inspissated and obstructs the distal ileum. It is usually a manifestation of cystic fibrosis. Approximately 20% of infants with cystic fibrosis present with meconium ileus at birth. Although it is usually understood as synonymous with cystic fibrosis until proven otherwise, it may also be seen with pancreatic atresia or stenosis of the pancreatic duct.Only rarely does it occur without cystic fibrosis or pancreatic abnormality, and is thought to be related to gut immaturity (more favourable outcome).Radiographic featuresPlain radiographNon-specific and may show dilated bowel loops proximal to the impaction. Classically, there is a paucity or absence of air-fluid levels and a "bubbly" appearance of the distended intestinal loops on radiographs. Occasionally, has a mottled appearance on radiographs during the first 2 days of life.FluoroscopyContrast enema will show a microcolon involving the entire large bowel and may show impacted meconium pellets filling defects, particularly in the right colon or in the distal ileum.UltrasoundPrenatal ultrasound findings associated with meconium ileus include   echogenic bowel, which can be dilated and thick walled polyhydramnios fetal ascites peritoneal wall calcifications intra-abdominal cysts Treatment and prognosisWater-soluble contrast enema usually clears the impacted meconium, with a success rate of over 60%. Complications  ileal atresia or stenosis ileal perforation resulting in meconium peritonitis   volvulus with or without pseudocyst formation Differential diagnosisGeneral imaging differential considerations include total colonic Hirschsprung disease  meconium plug syndrome 
__label__Paediatrics __label__Gastrointestinal Meconium peritonitis refers to a sterile chemical peritonitis due to intra-uterine bowel perforation and spillage of fetal meconium into the fetal peritoneal cavity. It is a common cause of peritoneal calcification.  On this page:  Article: Epidemiology Pathology Radiographic features Treatment and prognosis References   Images:Cases and figures  EpidemiologyThe estimated prevalence is at ~1 in 35,000.PathologyThe etiology is thought to be the result of a sterile chemical reaction resulting from bowel perforation in utero. The bowel perforates as a result of bowel obstruction, such as an atresia or meconium ileus. Secondary inflammatory response results in the production of fluid (ascites), fibrosis, calcification and sometimes cyst formation. Usually, the perforation seals off and the bowel is intact at birth. Intra-peritoneal meconium usually calcifies, sometimes within 24 hours. ClassificationAt least four types are recognized: fibro-adhesive (dense mass: the intense chemical reaction causes the formation of a dense mass with calcium deposits that eventually seal off the perforation) cystic generalized healed Associations  cystic fibrosis: does not usually calcify in these cases due to lack of enzymes intestinal atresia anal atresia ileal atresia jejunoileal atresia   polyhydramnios Radiographic featuresPlain radiographAbdominal radiographs may show intra-abdominal (peritoneal) calcification (can be curvilinear, linear or flocculant) a mass containing calcification in the context of a meconium pseudocyst  if the processus vaginalis is patent at the time of perforation, calcification may also be seen in the scrotum Ultrasound may show highly echogenic linear or clumped foci which represent calcification 3-4  can also give a snowstorm appearance 4  differentiated from other causes of intra-uterine calcification by its peritoneal distribution may show fetal ascites (most common antenatal sonographic finding 6) and/or polyhydramnios 11  the abdominal circumference may be increased may also show associated anomalies such as dilated fetal bowel and/or meconium pseudocysts  may show dilated stomach due to ileus Treatment and prognosisWhen the calcifications are isolated, there generally is a favourable neonatal outcome and intervention is not necessary 11. These cases are thought to represent perforation of bowel that spontaneously heals in utero. Therefore, in the absence of other findings, isolated calcifications can be followed sonographically during pregnancy.Complications   ascites: tends to be more echogenic than simple ascites 10   bowel obstruction from the formation of fibro-adhesive bands  meconium pseudocyst formation (a walled-off mass of meconium surrounded by a calcific rim) 
__label__Paediatrics Meconium plug syndrome refers to a functional colonic obstruction in a newborn due to an obstructing meconium plug. It is usually transient and affects the left colon with meconium plugging the bowel distal to this segment. In this situation, it is also termed the small left colon syndrome. On this page:  Article: Pathology Radiographic features Treatment and prognosis Differential diagnosis References   Images: Cases and figures Imaging differential diagnosis   PathologyAssociations may have a higher prevalence with maternal diabetes 2   Hirschsprung disease in ~15% 3  may be associated with cystic fibrosis 3  Radiographic featuresRadiographMay show multiple dilated bowel loops which are a non-specific finding. There may be a caliber change around the splenic flexure.Fluoroscopy: contrast enemaContrast enema may demonstrate a small caliber to the left colon with multiple filling defects within due to retained meconium. The rectum is usually normal in size, unlike Hirschsprung disease. The use of high osmolar ionic contrast media for enema in a neonate or infant is controversial due to the risks associated with fluid shift 4.  The enema can be both diagnostic as well as therapeutic and is usually accompanied by the passage of meconium during or after the procedure.Treatment and prognosisUsually, resolves with time. Initial nonsurgical management includes rectal stimulation and contrast enema 3.Differential diagnosisOn a plain radiograph consider most other causes of bowel obstruction. On a contrast enema consider:  meconium ileus (right colon usually not dilated) long segment Hirschsprung disease (often has a reversed recto-sigmoid ratio)  ileal atresia (on contrast enema)

It is one of several described signs of pectus excavatum on frontal chest radiographs. Radiographic featuresPlain radiographWomen with pectus excavatum may have a more vertically oriented and more sharply defined medial breast borders on frontal x-rays than women with normal chest wall morphology. Visualization of the medial borders of the breasts reflects altered chest wall anatomy in pectus excavatum. With the inward depression of the anterior chest wall, the breasts are more likely to be displaced medially, and the medial borders of the breasts oriented more tangentially to the direction of the x-rays. The breasts of women with pectus exacavatum, instead of slightly diverging, are oriented parallel to each other so that, unless they are touching, their medial borders become more vertical and sharper than they would have been without the anatomical variation.

__label__Musculoskeletal The medial cutaneous nerve of the arm, also known as the lesser internal cutaneous nerve of arm, is a branch of the medial cord of the brachial plexus and supplies the skin of the medial side of the arm as far distal as the medial epicondyle.Gross anatomyOriginThe medial cutaneous nerve of the arm arises from the medial cord of the brachial plexus and receives fibers form the eighth cervical and first thoracic nerve roots.CourseThe medial cutaneous nerve of the arm is the smallest and most medial of the branches of the brachial plexus. Originally posterior to the axillary vein, it then comes to lie on the medial side of the vein. In the arm it descends along the medial side of the brachial vein to the mid-portion of the arm where it pierces the deep fascia of the arm to give off its terminal cutaneous branches.Branches and supplyskin of the medial side of the arm as far distal as the medial epicondyle of the humerus and olecranon of ulnaRelations courses along the medial side of the axillary and brachial veins shortly after branching from the brachial plexus the medial cutaneous nerve of the arm communicates with the intercostobrachial nerve, the lateral cutaneous branch of the second intercostal nerve which supplies the skin of the axilla.

__label__Musculoskeletal The medial cutaneous nerve of the forearm, also known as the medial antebrachial cutaneous nerve, is a branch of the medial cord of the brachial plexus and supplies the anterior and medial aspects of the forearm as far distal as the wrist.  Gross anatomyOriginThe medial cutaneous nerve of forearm arises from the medial cord of the brachial plexus and receives fibers form the eighth cervical and first thoracic nerve roots.CourseThe medial cutaneous nerve of the forearm is a large nerve that arises from the medial cord of the brachial plexus. Initially it runs with the ulnar nerve with which it is sometimes confused. The nerve then pierces the deep fascia at approximately the mid-arm, alongside the basilic vein to enter the subcutaneous tissues of the forearm. The medial cutaneous nerve of the forearm divides into anterior and posterior (or volar and ulnar) terminal branches.Branches and supplyThe anterior branch (volar banch) of the medial cutaneous nerve of the forearm is typically larger and usually passes anteriorly to the basilic vein. The nerve then descends on the anteriomedial aspect of the forearm distributing small cutaneous branches to the ulnar side of the forearm as far as the wrist. Distally the anterior branch communicates with the palmar cutaneous branch of the ulnar nerve. The posterior branch (ulnar branch) passes obliquely down along the medial side of the basilic vein to the posterior aspect of the forearm and descends on its ulnar side giving off small cutaneous terminal branches along its course. The posterior branch communicates with the medial cutaneous nerve of the arm and the posterior cutaneous nerve of the forearm, a branch of the radial nerve.Relations initially it runs between the axillary artery and the axillary vein in front of the ulnar nerve pierces the deep fascia of the arm alongside the basilic vein  Variant anatomyAnomalous communication between the medial cutaneous branch of forearm and the radial nerve has been reported in isolated cadaveric dissections. 
__label__Musculoskeletal Medial epicondyle apophysitis is one of the manifestations of little leaguer's elbow in patients with open medial epicondyle physis. It occurs due to extreme valgus and hyper extension overload forces applied over medial aspect of the elbow during throwing a ball. On this page:  Article: Epidemiology Clinical presentation Pathology Radiographic features Treatment and prognosis See also References   EpidemiologyIt occurs in skeletally immature athletes before the closure of medial epicondyle growth plate. Younger patients are more likely to develop avulsion injury or apophysitis than ligament injuries, cause the apophysis- cartilage interface is the weakest point in medial aspect of elbow at that time. After closer of physis medial collateral ligament and flexor tendon complex is more likely to injure. Clinical presentationThe presentation includes: pain in a throwing arm, decreased throwing speed, power, and accuracy. Physical examination may reveal medial and proximal elbow focal tenderness and swelling. Applying valgus forces to the elbow may worsen the symptoms.PathologyForceful throwing or overhead strokes generates extreme valgus and extension with tensile forces in the medial elbow.Radiographic featuresMRI widening of the physis with adjacent sclerosis and cortical irregularity. MRI may show increased fluid signal and widening of the physis with apophyseal edema-like lesions in severe cases, fragmentation and avulsion fracture may occur by advancing age and skeletal maturity, injurers of ulnar collateral ligament become more prevalent in younger children due to higher elastin and low type I collagen content, slightly high T1 and T2 signal within the ligament is considered normal and should not be mistaken for tear or tendinopathy Treatment and prognosisTreatment is conservative management including rest, physiotherapy, correction of technique, and strengthening muscles. If left untreated it results in mal- or non union. See alsooverhead sports injury of the elbow
__label__Musculoskeletal __label__Paediatrics Medial epicondyle fractures represent almost all epicondyle fractures and occur when there is avulsion of the medial epicondyle. They are typically seen in children, and can be challenging to identify. Failure to diagnose these injuries can lead to significant long term disability.  On this page:  Article: Epidemiology Mechanism Radiographic features Radiology report Treatment and prognosis Related articles References   Images:Cases and figures  EpidemiologyMedial epicondylar avulsion fractures are the most common avulsion injury of the elbow and are typically seen in children and adolescents 4. MechanismA number of mechanisms have been implicated in medial epicondylar avulsion fractures 2,4: posterior elbow dislocation transmitting force to the medial epicondyle via the ulnar collateral ligament (most common; accounts for two thirds of cases of medial epicondylar fractures 3)  fall on an outstretched hand with the elbow in full extension, resulting in sudden traction on the flexor pronator muscle group of the forearm  direct blow (rare) chronic injury can also occur both in children (little league elbow) and adults (golfer's elbow) - discussed separately Radiographic featuresIn young patients, knowledge of the sequence of ossification of the elbow (remembered using the mnemonic CRITOE) is essential as an avulsed and displaced apophysis can mimic another center. Overall all centers are ossified by approximately 12 years of age, appearing in a predictable order: capitellum, radial head, medial (internal) epicondyle, trochlear, olecranon, and lastly lateral (external) epicondyle). Any missing ossification center or centers appearing in the wrong sequence should be viewed with a high suspicion of injury.A particularly devastating miss is that of an avulsed fragment displaced into the joint, mimicking the center of ossification of the trochlear 4.  Plain radiographPlain films are usually sufficient for assessment of medial epicondylar avulsion fractures. If in doubt, comparison with the contralateral side can be helpful to diagnose a slight injury. In the setting of more complex injury, a cross-sectional imaging may be needed.Features of a medial epicondylar avulsion injury include 1-3: soft tissue swelling this may be the only sign of an undisplaced injury this may be the only sign in children younger than ~7 years, in whom the medial apophysis is not ossified   widening of the growth plate (comparison to the contralateral side may be useful) obvious displacement of the apophysis  fracture through the adjacent humeral metaphysis Radiology reportIn addition to stating that a medial epicondylar fracture is present, a number of features should be sought and commented upon: avulsion degree of displacement location of the displaced fragment presence of a fracture of the adjacent humeral metaphysis presence of comminution of the apophysis   elbow careful assessment of the centers of ossification to ensure they are age appropriate (see CRITOE) evidence of elbow dislocation (spontaneous reduction at the time of injury may have occurred)coronoid process and radial head fractures (terrible triad of the elbow)     Treatment and prognosisTreatment depends on both the particulars of the fracture and the patient. An undisplaced fracture, particularly in the non-dominant arm of a non-athlete can be treated conservatively (three weeks in an upper arm splint) with good results 2,3.Minimally displaced fractures can be treated with either cast immobilization or an upper arm splint, with a 50% of resulting in a pseudoarthrosis 3.Displaced fractures or those occurring in the dominant arm, especially in athletes, need operative management, typically with open reduction and internal fixation with a cannulated screw, which results in rigid fixation permitting early motion 2. Bony union is achieved in 90% of cases 3. Comminuted fractures can also be treated by suture fixation 2. Fortunately, as these injuries involve an apophysis rather than an epiphysis, no growth arrest of the arm occurs, however elbow instability and even recurrent dislocations can result from suboptimal healing 2,3.
__label__Musculoskeletal Medial epicondylitis (plural: medial epicondylitides) (also known as golfer's elbow) is an angiofibroblastic tendinosis of the common flexor-pronator tendon group of the elbow. On this page:  Article: Epidemiology Clinical presentation Pathology Radiographic features Treatment and prognosis Differential diagnosis Related articles References   Images:Cases and figures  EpidemiologyIt is less common than lateral epicondylitis. As with lateral epicondylitis, it typically occurs in the 4th to 5th decades of life. There is no recognized gender predilection.Clinical presentationPatients typically present with insidiously medial elbow pain. The pain can worsen with wrist flexion and forearm pronation activities. Patients may offer a history of sports activities, including golf, overhead throwing sports, and racket sports. The patient's history may include the occurrence of an acute sports injury or acute trauma.PathologyIt is thought to occur from valgus forces transmitted to the medial elbow during forearm pronation and wrist flexion may exceed the strength of the muscles, tendons, and supporting ligaments. Cumulative stress or overuse can lead to tendinosis involving the musculotendinous junction of the flexor-pronator muscle group at the medial epicondyle, with microtrauma and partial tearing that may progress to a full-thickness tendon tear.Radiographic featuresMR imaging is the most widely used modality for assessment, although ultrasound also may be performed.Plain radiographsMore content to be addedUltrasoundMay be identified as outward bowing, heterogeneous echogenicity, or thickening of the common tendon, with subjacent fluid collection and intratendinous calcification. Discrete tears appear as hypoechoic regions with adjacent tendon discontinuity.MRI  Described features on MRI include 2: thickening and increased signal intensity on both T1 and T2 weighted sequences of the common flexor tendon soft tissue edema around the common flexor tendon Treatment and prognosisTreatment starts with the application of cold packs to the elbow and oral NSAID therapy. Other clinical approaches include the use of a splint, one or more local corticosteroid injections, application of ultrasound waves and guided rehabilitation program. Surgery is often performed if there is no clinical response after 3 to 6 months of conservative treatment.Differential diagnosisFor a clinical differential diagnosis of medial elbow pain, consider: occult fracture medial osteoarthrosis medial collateral ligament injury

__label__Central __label__Nervous __label__System The medial frontal gyrus is the superior most part of the medial surface of the frontal lobe, which continues onto the superior surface as the superior frontal gyrus. Posteriorly it contains the supplementary motor area.TerminologyThe medial frontal gyrus is perhaps more commonly merely referred to as the medial surface of the superior frontal gyrus, although as their posterior extent is not identical (see below) the distinction is useful. It should not, however, be confused with the middle frontal gyrus, located between the superior and inferior frontal gyri on the superolateral surface of the lobe. RelationsThe medial frontal gyrus extends from the frontal pole anteriorly, to the paracentral sulcus posteriorly which separates it from the paracentral lobule. Note that this is not quite as far posteriorly as the superior frontal gyrus, which extends as far back as the precentral sulcus, located one sulcus further posterior to the paracentral sulcus 1. Inferiorly the medial frontal gyrus is separated from the cingulate gyrus by the cingulate sulcus.

__label__Central __label__Nervous __label__System The medial lemniscus, also known as Reil's band, is an ascending bundle of myelinated axons extending from the gracile and cuneate nuclei in the dorsal medulla up to the contralateral thalamus.Gross anatomyThe medial lemniscus is part of the larger dorsal column-medial lemniscus pathway, important for conveying the sensation for fine (discriminative) touch, vibration and conscious proprioception. CourseGracile and cuneate nuclei are second-order sensory neurons which receive peripheral input from the first-order neurons in the gracile fasciculus and the cuneate fasciculus of the dorsal columns. These nuclei send out axons called the internal arcuate fibers, which become the medial lemniscus after they decussate in the medulla oblongata 1,2.The medial lemniscus terminates in the ventral posterior nuclei of the thalamus - ventral posterolateral (VPL) and ventral posteromedial (VPM) - where it synapses with the third-order neurons which transmit information to the postcentral gyrus of the cerebral cortex 1,2.​
__label__Vascular __label__Central __label__Nervous __label__System The medial lenticulostriate arteries are generally considered to arise from the A1 segment of anterior cerebral artery (ACA), and supply the globus pallidus and medial portion of the putamen 1,3. They are shorter, thinner and fewer in number than the lateral lenticulostriate arteries, which arise more distally along the M1 segment.Some controversy persists on their origin: most describe them as arising from the A1 segment of the ACA 1;3. However, some, including Osborne 2, divide the perforating arteries that arise from the middle cerebral artery (MCA) M1 segment into medial (those arising proximally) and lateral (those arising more distally) groups. Furthermore, these perforating arteries can arise from other proximal branches (e.g. the fronto-orbital artery) 4. It is therefore easier to consider these arteries from the point of view of the tissue they supply, rather than what artery they arise from.  The medial lenticulostriate arteries should not be confused with the perforating branches from the A1/A2 segments of the ACA, the largest branch being the recurrent artery of Heubner. However, in 26% of cases, the medial lenticulostriate arteries can be replaced by the recurrent artery of Heubner 5.
__label__Central __label__Nervous __label__System The medial longitudinal fasciculus (MLF) is a myelinated composite fiber tract found in the brainstem. The MLF primarily serves to coordinate the conjugate movement of the eyes and associated head and neck movements. On this page:  Article: Gross Anatomy Function Related pathology Related articles References   Images:Cases and figures  Gross AnatomyContaining both ascending and descending fiber tracts, the MLF is found on each side of the brainstem near the midline, ventral to the periaqueductal grey matter, and ascends to the interstitial nucleus (of Cajal) 1.The MLF links the nuclei of the vestibulocochlear nerve (CN VIII) and the three primary nerves controlling the movements of the eye: oculomotor nerve (CN III) trochlear nerve (CN IV) abducens nerve (CN VI) Ascending fibers are contributed to by the four vestibular nuclei. Descending axons from the medial vestibular nuclei partially decussate and continue as the medial vestibulospinal tract at the level of the spinal cord. The dorsal trapezoid, posterior commissural and lateral lemniscal nuclei all contribute fibers, thereby linking both vestibular and cochlear components of CN VIII to the MLF.FunctionThe MLF integrates the information received about the movement of the eyes and the movement of the head and plays a central role in the optokinetic and vestibulo-ocular reflexes. Fibers within the fasciculus connect the abducens nucleus with the contralateral oculomotor nucleus allowing horizontal conjugate lateral gaze and saccadic eye movements. Fibers are also carried from the vestibular nuclei to integrate with the oculomotor and trochlear nuclei, which serve to influence eye movements during movement of the head and neck 2.Related pathologylesions to the MLF cause internuclear ophthalmoplegia

__label__Vascular The median cubital vein is the superficial vein overlying the bicipital aponeurosis in the roof of the cubital fossa, commonly cannulated for intravenous access. It variably forms as either a H or M type pattern joining the median antebrachial, basilic and cephalic veins. If a M-shaped pattern, each limb of the vein may be described as median cephalic and median basilic veins separately.

It forms from nerve roots originating at C5-T1.CourseIn the axilla, the median nerve lies lateral to the axillary artery. It enters the arm from axilla at the inferior margin of the teres major muscle and descends medially between biceps brachii and triceps brachii. In the arm, the median nerve courses laterally to the brachial artery and then crosses it, usually anteriorly, from lateral to medial. It lies initially on coracobrachialis, then brachialis. In the cubital fossa, the median nerve lies medial to the brachial artery and the biceps brachii tendon.The median nerve leaves the bicipital aponeurosis and enters the forearm between the two heads of pronator teres muscle and gives off the anterior interosseous nerve. It courses towards the wrist deep to flexor digitorum superficialis and superficial to flexor digitorum profundus muscle. It emerges lateral to the flexor digitorum superficialis about 5 cm proximal to the wrist (giving off the palmar cutaneous branch) and enters the hand through the carpal tunnel (the only nerve to traverse the carpal tunnel), passing deep to the flexor retinaculum at the wrist. On entering the palm, it gives off motor and cutaneous branches.Branches muscular branch just above elbow supplies pronator teres muscle (lying within the superficial layer of forearm flexors) muscular branch at elbow: supplies remainder of superficial layer of forearm flexors (including flexor carpi radialis and palmaris longus, with the exception of flexor carpi ulnaris) and intermediate layer of forearm flexors (flexor digitorum superficialis)  anterior interosseous nerve: supplies flexor pollicis longus, pronator quadratus and radial half of flexor digitorum profundus  palmar cutaneous branch: arising from vololateral aspect before median nerve entering wrist, superficial to the carpal tunnel and lies between palmaris longus and flexor carpi radialis and supplies the cutaneous innervation to the palm and skin over thenar eminence  recurrent branch: motor branch in the hand: supplies thenar muscles including abductor pollicis brevis, superficial head of flexor pollicis brevis, and opponens pollicis and the radial two lumbricalsleaves the carpal tunnel over the distal border of the flexor retinaculum onto flexor pollicis brevis to terminate by passing into the thenar eminence  digital cutaneous branch: palmar aspect and dorsal nail beds of the thumb, index and middle fingers and the radial half of the ring finger articular branches to the elbow, wrist, carpal and phalangeal joints Variant anatomy high division or bifid median nerve  median nerve (normal or bifid) may be accompanied by a persistent median artery of the forearm  accessory branches arising proximal or distal to the carpal tunnel  variant course of thenar branch 5  aberrant origin to the motor branch (under the flexor retinaculum or through the flexor retinaculum) 6  anastomoses between median and ulnar nerves which may complicate clinical examination or EMG studies:  Martin-Gruber nerve: between median nerve or anterior interosseous branch and ulnar nerve  Riche-Cannieu anastomosis: between deep branch ulnar nerve and recurrent branch median nerve  Berrettini anastomosis: between digital sensory nerve of ulnar and median nerves   Related pathology entrapment syndromes of the median nerve anterior interosseous nerve syndrome pronator teres syndrome carpal tunnel syndrome

__label__Musculoskeletal Entrapment syndromes of the median nerve represent the median nerve being compressed at a number of distinct sites leading to a number of distinct clinical syndromes. Entrapment is but one of the gamut of pathologies causing neuropathy, albeit one of the more common etiologies and, more importantly for radiologists, one of the causes of neuropathy in which radiology can play a vital role in diagnosis. Entrapment syndromes, as a rule, affect nerves at defined anatomical locations, facilitating a more focused search for causative lesions. The three most common median nerve entrapment syndromes are:  pronator teres syndrome (PTS)  anterior interosseous nerve syndrome (AINS) (aka Kiloh-Nevin syndrome) carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) Rarely, the median nerve may be compressed by thickened lacertus fibrosus, Struthers ligament, or Gantzer muscle.This article gives a short overview of these three syndromes focusing on pertinent differences.

__label__Vascular __label__Central __label__Nervous __label__System The median prosencephalic vein of Markowski is a precursor to the vein of Galen; typically before birth, its anterior portion regresses with formation of the internal cerebral veins and its posterior portion persists as the vein of Galen. If an arterio-venous fistula exists, it balloons out to become the 'aneurysmal' vein of Galen malformation. This occurs because the vein is thin walled, lies free within the subarachnoid space, and is unable to accommodate the arterial flow.

__label__Chest Mediastinal lymphadenopathy in interstitial lung disease can be a frequent feature although its presence has limited value in the differential diagnosis. In certain forms of interstitial lung disease, the extent of lymph node enlargement may correlate to disease activity or progression of fibrosis 2-4. While many nodes may be larger than 10 mm it is uncommon to have nodes greater than 15 mm (short axis diameter) 3.See also interstitial lung disease mediastinal lymphadenopathy 
__label__Chest __label__Haematology __label__Oncology Mediastinal lymph node enlargement can occur from a wide range of pathologies, either by its own or in association with other lung pathology. Historically a size cut-off of 10 mm short-axis diameter was used.  On this page:  Article: Terminology Pathology Practical points See also References   Images:Cases and figures  TerminologyAlthough mediastinal lymphadenopathy is used interchangeably - by some - with "mediastinal lymph node enlargement", they are not synonymous entities, and it is important to be cognizant of this. Many enlarged mediastinal nodes will be pathological, however not all, and conversely, some mediastinal lymphadenopathy will be found in non-enlarged nodes. The diagnostic waters are muddied further as some pathologies produce nodal enlargement via reactive change, and not because the pathology is actually infiltrating the node itself, eg. bacterial pneumonia is associated with reactive enlargement of the mediastinal nodes, but the organism is not generally infecting the node itself. In tuberculosis, however, the mycobacterium is actually infiltrating and infecting the lymph node.Some radiologists make a point of differentiating between reactive nodal enlargement and pathological nodal enlargement, reserving lymphadenopathy for the latter etiologies only.PathologyThe spectrum of conditions that can result in mediastinal lymphadenopathy is extremely diverse and includes:  sarcoidosis (see: pulmonary manifestations of sarcoidosis) primary lung cancer  metastatic malignancies to the mediastinum from other sites common esophageal cancer breast cancer thyroid cancer   less common malignant pleural mesothelioma thymic epithelial tumor      mediastinal lymphomaprimary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma  Kaposi sarcoma certain non-lymphomatous pulmonary lymphoid disorders Castleman disease  lymphomatoid granulomatosis - pulmonary manifestations of lymphomatoid granulomatosis  angioimmunoblastic lymphadenopathy (AILD)   infective etiology  pulmonary infection, e.g. pneumonia, pulmonary tuberculosis  thoracic histoplasmosis   occupational lung disease silicosis coal worker's pneumoconiosis chronic beryllium lung disease   mediastinal lymphadenopathy in interstitial lung disease  pulmonary manifestation of rheumatoid arthritis (rare) 5   scleroderma / CREST syndrome 10,11  related to congestive cardiac failure 7,8  medication-related, e.g. phenytoin, methotrexate 6  Practical pointsIf incidentally detected, the ACR committee white paper in 2018 suggests clinical consultation, further workup with CT-PET +/- follow up CT chest in 3-6 months if short-axis diameter over 15 mm and if there is no explicable disease 9.

__label__Chest Mediastinal lymphoma is common, either as part of disseminated disease or less commonly as the site of primary involvement. On this page:  Article: Epidemiology Clinical presentation Pathology Radiographic features Treatment and prognosis Differential diagnosis Related articles References   Images: Cases and figures Imaging differential diagnosis   EpidemiologyLymphomas are responsible for approximately 15% of all primary mediastinal masses, and 45% of anterior mediastinal masses in children 1. Only 10% of lymphomas which involve the mediastinum are primary (i.e. mediastinal involvement not part of systemic disease) and the majority are Hodgkin lymphomas (~ 60%) 5.Clinical presentationThe mediastinum is commonly involved in systemic lymphomas. Approximately 60% of all Hodgkin lymphoma and 20% of non-Hodgkin lymphoma involves the mediastinum at presentation. Less frequently, the disease is isolated to the mediastinum (3% Hodgkin lymphoma, <10% non-Hodgkin lymphoma) 1. As such, patients are often asymptomatic from the mediastinal component but present with systemic manifestations of lymphoma, most commonly constitutional symptoms 5.Symptoms directly attributable to the mediastinal component include 4-5: retrosternal chest pain  SVC compression with SVC syndrome  dyspnea cough PathologyMediastinal lymphomas usually arise from either the thymus or lymph nodes, thus accounting for their predilection for the anterior and middle mediastinum 1. The anterior mediastinal and para-tracheal nodes are the most frequently involved regions while isolated hilar node enlargement is uncommon without accompanying mediastinal node enlargement. Posterior mediastinal involvement is also infrequent.Current World Health Organization classification of neoplastic diseases of the lymphoid tissues includes lymphomas and leukaemias, and is according to the cell of origin, with the main division being: B-cell neoplasms T-cell and natural killer cell neoplasms Hodgkin lymphoma Primary mediastinal lymphomas are most frequently of three histologic varieties 5: nodular sclerosing Hodgkin lymphoma   primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma 3  lymphoblastic lymphoma Radiographic featuresThe majority of patients have anterior mediastinal and paratracheal involvement. Isolated hilar nodal involvement is uncommon 6.Plain radiographA soft tissue mass may be clearly visible, or more frequently the mediastinum is widened, and the retrosternal airspace is obscured.CTCT demonstrates a soft tissue attenuating mass, with smooth or lobulated margins which conform to surrounding structures. Cystic/ low-density areas are common. Other features include 6: parenchymal invasion: uncommon  pleural effusion(s) seen in 50% of cases usually unilateral usually exudates pleural deposits may be present   pericardial effusion chest wall invasion Calcification is usually seen following therapy and can have varying morphology, including irregular, diffuse or even egg-shell 6.Following treatment nodal masses usually reduce in size, however in some instances the size of the mass remains the same or even increases (in cases of thymic hyperplasia) 2. As such CT is not ideal for assessing for treatment response when a decrease in size is not present.MRIAppearance of lymphomas on MRI varies with treatment and type of lymphoma 2.  T1: replace  T2 at diagnosis: variable but present following treatment: decreases    T1 C+ (Gd) at diagnosis: variable but present following treatment: decreases and becomes more heterogeneous due to necrosis and fibrosis 2  absence of decrease following treatment suggests the continued presence of viable neoplastic tissue 2    Gallium and FDG-PETBoth gallium-67 scintigraphy and FDG-PET are better able to assess for tumor viability following treatment than CT, as residual mass does not necessarily represent residual viable neoplastic tissue 2.Unfortunately, up to 20% of cases are gallium negative at diagnosis 2.Treatment and prognosisSpecific treatment depends on the type of lymphoma and the stage, but broadly requires chemotherapy and or radiotherapy 5.Similarly, the prognosis is very variable. Stage I and II Hodgkin lymphoma have the best prognosis with a greater than 90% cure rate 5.ComplicationsComplications include:vascular compression 4 SVC syndrome compression of the aorta compression of the pulmonary arteries  Differential diagnosisOn chest radiography, the differential is that of mediastinal lymph node enlargement and of an anterior mediastinal mass.On CT the differential includes: thymic tumors mediastinal germ cell tumors sarcoidosis infection: especially tuberculosis  
__label__Chest Mediastinal mass may be caused by a wide variety of neoplastic and non-neoplastic pathologies. It is helpful to identify the location of the mass since this significantly reduces the breadth of the differential diagnosis. There are four conceptual compartments of the mediastinum which are largely dictated by their relationship to the pericardium:  superior mediastinum: above the thoracic plane   inferior mediastinum: below the thoracic plane  anterior mediastinal mass: anterior to the pericardium  middle mediastinal mass: within the pericardium  posterior mediastinal mass: posterior to the pericardium

The symptoms include dysphagia, odynophagia, chest pain, dyspnea and symptoms of pericardial or pleural effusion.PathologyIt is believed that during the acute phase of pseudocyst formation the fluid may track along the path of least resistance to gain access into the posterior mediastinum through diaphragmatic foramen and hiatus. Later in the phase, the outer wall gets organized to form a pseudocyst.Radiographic features RadiographChest radiography is not diagnostic but can reveal lower mediastinal widening, retro or para-cardiac well-defined opacity. Other associated features can be seen i.e. pleural effusion or large pericardial effusion.CTContrast-enhanced CT is one of the valuable procedure to identify the pseudocyst as well as establishing its relationship with surrounding structure. It appears as a thin-walled low attenuation peripherally enhancing cyst.MRIMRI-MRCP is as effective as ERCP to demonstrate the track between the peri-pancreatic cyst and the mediastinal cyst.Differential diagnosisThe differential will depend on the clinical context but as broad differential for cystic mediastinal lesions consider - other cystic mediastinal lesions.
__label__Chest Mediastinal teratomas are germ cell tumors located in the anterior mediastinum, representing the most common extra-gonadal germ cell tumors. On this page:  Article: Epidemiology Clinical presentation Pathology Radiographic features Treatment and prognosis Differential diagnosis Related articles References   Images: Cases and figures Imaging differential diagnosis   EpidemiologyThey account for approximately 15% of anterior mediastinal masses in adults and approximately 25% of anterior mediastinal masses in children. They are by far the most common mediastinal germ cell tumor, accounting for 50-70% of such tumors 9.The age of presentation is wide, but the typical presentation in adults is in the third or fourth decade (the 20s and 30s). In children below one year of age, immature teratomas are common (40%) and may be detected antenatally 9.No particular gender predilection for mature teratomas has been identified (at most there is a slight female predilection). Immature teratomas, however, occur almost exclusively in males 9. Clinical presentationThe majority of patients are asymptomatic, with the mediastinal mass discovered incidentally when the thorax is imaged for another reason 7,9. Masses that become symptomatic can do so in a variety of ways:  mass effect respiratory distress (infants) respiratory failure superior mediastinal syndrome neck mass  Horner syndrome 9     endocrine functionhormone production, e.g. beta-HCG, insulin   rupture chest pain hemoptysis respiratory distress  cardiac tamponade 9   pleural effusions 9    PathologyMediastinal teratomas are germ cell tumors arising from ectopic pluripotent stem cells that failed to migrate from yolk endoderm to the gonad. By definition, they should contain elements from all three embryological layers: endoderm, mesoderm and ectoderm. Frequently, however, elements from only two layers are evident 7 (see teratoma article).A mediastinal dermoid cyst can be considered a variant of mature teratoma, predominantly formed by squamous epithelium and skin appendages (ectoderm and mesoderm respectively) 9.Teratomas may either be: mature: well differentiated immature: poorly differentiated with malignant transformationmature teratoma with non-germ cell malignancy arising from one of the components 2   Because they originate from primitive cells, they have variable neoplastic potential. Generally, cystic lesions tend to be benign whereas solid lesions tend to be malignant; however the final diagnosis is made histologically.Mature teratomas and most immature teratomas are benign tumors, but still, carry a risk of malignancy despite being indolent initially and require close clinical, serological, and radiological follow-up, or surgical excision 4,5,9.  There is also a low incidence of malignant transformation of somatic cells (i.e. non-germ cell components) within these tumors, e.g. carcinoma, sarcoma, leukemia 6.LocationUsually occurs within or near the thymus gland.AssociationsMature teratomas have been associated with: Klinefelter syndrome (47, XXY) 9 Immature teratomas can be associated with: non-lymphocytic leukemia pleomorphic undifferentiated sarcoma Radiographic featuresThe vast majority of mediastinal teratomas are located in the anterior mediastinum (80%), with most of the remainder involving multiple compartments (13-15%). Isolated posterior or middle mediastinal location is uncommon (2-8%) 9.Mature teratomaMature teratomas, by their very nature, may contain a vast range of tissues and thus have variable imaging features. In general, they have the following features: well-demarcated, displacing rather than invading adjacent structures large: 3-25 cm 9  usually cystic: 90% 9may be uni- or multiloculated  septal/rim contrast enhancement variable attenuation, consistent with different tissues fat water density cystic spaces fat-fluid levels (specific) homogeneous soft-tissue density calcification: 26% 9identifiable teeth or bone is seen in up to 8% of cases 9     When rupture has occurred, the density of each component is less likely to be homogeneous, but rather each part of the teratoma is heterogeneous (i.e. the fat component is heterogeneous, as is the cystic component etc.) 7.ImmatureImmature teratomas are usually solid.Plain radiographAppearances on chest radiography are usually indistinguishable from many of the other causes of an anterior mediastinal mass. Calcification may be visible.CTCT is the mainstay of diagnosis. The appearance will depend on the type of teratoma, and whether or not a cystic teratoma has ruptured. They are all however usually located in the anterior mediastinum.Treatment and prognosisTreatment depends on whether the teratoma is mature or immature. In the former, surgical resection is curative. In the later management depends on alpha-FP levels. If these are elevated then postoperative chemotherapy is usually employed 8. Prognosis of mature teratomas is excellent as they are benign tumors. Pure immature teratomas also usually have an excellent prognosis, especially in childhood. In up to 30% of cases, however, immature teratomas have a malignant germ cell tumor component (most frequently yolk sac tumor), which result in frequent (25%) recurrence. Nonetheless, with adjuvant chemotherapy, a greater than 80% three-year survival can be achieved in children. Prognosis in adults is less favourable 9.Potential complications include respiratory distress/failure: infants>adults hemorrhage pneumothorax fistula(e)  formation: aorta, SVC, esophagus, bronchus rupture bronchus: trichoptysis is pathognomic pericardium: pericardial effusion and tamponade pleural cavity: pleural effusion    Differential diagnosisOn chest radiography, the differential is broad, and includes any cause of an anterior mediastinal mass:  differential diagnosis for anterior mediastinal tumors mnemonic: 5 T's.

This is considered a serious and potentially life-threatening condition. Chronic mediastinitis (fibrosing mediastinitis) is a condition with a varied etiology which includes; idiopathic, immune-mediated, or infective (e.g. tuberculosis).

Infection secondary to median sternotomy has been reported to have a prevalence of 0.5-5% 1,2. Risk factors for mediastinitis include diabetes mellitus and immunosuppression, in addition to factors which could contribute to increased postoperative complications, such as advanced age, obesity and smoking 2,3.Clinical presentationPatients may experience retrosternal pain and exhibit systemic signs such as fever, tachycardia or hypotension. Blood results may reveal a raised WCC, neutrophilia and CRP 2,3.Additional symptoms and signs depend upon the etiology and specific clinical scenario.Mediastinitis secondary to esophageal perforation may present after a recent endoscopy, or after a bout of forceful vomiting (Boerhaave syndrome).  Patients with a mediastinal infection secondary to an infected median sternotomy wound may have signs of wound infection on examination 2.  Infection spreading from the head and neck may have additional signs pointing to a localized source of infection such as dental, neck or throat pain.Radiographic featuresPlain radiographFindings are non-specific and overlap with other pathologies involving the mediastinum. Findings may include mediastinal widening and abnormality of the right paratracheal stripe. Additional features which could indicate esophageal perforation in the correct clinical context include pneumomediastinum and subcutaneous emphysema. Pleural effusions may also be seen 1.CTFeatures may include: evidence of mediastinal inflammation such as fat stranding, edema and loss of the normal fat planes single or multiple mediastinal fluid collections which may contain gas locules and demonstrate an enhancing wall locoregional lymphadenopathy complications from spread of infection: empyema or subphrenic abscess. Pericardial effusion may indicate pericarditis  It is important to note that a level of inflammatory change, fluid and hemorrhage is expected following recent cardiac surgery and may last up to 2 weeks 1,2. A combination of, comparison to previous imaging, judgment of expected appearance, and discussion with the clinical team regarding the patients' current condition may be helpful in guiding interpretation.Additional findings depend on the etiology:  ossophageal perforation: thickening and/or collection adjacent to the affected portion of the esophagus, extravasation of oral contrast into the mediastinum (if oral contrast administered) deep sternal wound infection: associated subcutaneous stranding/collection may be evident  descending necrotizing mediastinitis: imaging of the neck may reveal the infection extending through the neck spaces into the mediastinum Treatment and prognosisAcute mediastinitis is a serious and potentially life-threatening condition with considerable mortality. Early diagnosis, antibiotic therapy and surgical drainage are essential in the control of infection 2,3. Image-guided drainage could be considered in specific instances. Microbiological analysis of fluid samples is important in guiding further antibiotic therapy. Further management will depend on the underlying specific cause of infection 2.See also Boerhaave syndrome Descending necrotizing mediastinitis Retropharyngeal abscess Fibrosing mediastinitis 
__label__Chest The mediastinum is a space in the thorax that contains a group of organs, vessels, nerves, lymphatics and their surrounding connective tissue. It lies in the midline of the chest between the pleura of each lung and extends from the sternum to the vertebral column. Gross anatomyThe mediastinum contains all the thoracic viscera except the lungs: heart and great vessels, internal mammary vessels, proximal aspect of azygos venous system, esophagus, trachea, phrenic nerve, cardiac nerve, supra-aortic and para-aortic bodies, thoracic duct, thymus, and mediastinal lymph nodes.Anatomical divisionDivision of the mediastinum is generally conceptualized as comprising 3 or 4 compartments, depending on the schema. For example, the mediastinum can be divided into parts based on their relationship to the fibrous pericardium:  superior mediastinum: above the upper level of the pericardium and plane of Ludwig   inferior mediastinum: below the plane of Ludwig  anterior mediastinum: anterior to the pericardium  middle mediastinum: within the pericardium  posterior mediastinum: posterior to the pericardium   Historically, there have been discrepant definitions of the mediastinal compartments between medical disciplines. For example, radiologists originally used arbitrary radiologic landmarks on lateral radiographs, while surgeons considered the mediastinum according to anatomic limits encountered intraoperatively (e.g. Shields classification). In response, there have been efforts to reconcile mediastinal classification systems for consistency.2 The ITMIG classification system, developed by a multidisciplinary group including radiologists and thoracic surgeons, relies on CT-based anatomic divisions.3Relations superiorly: continuous with the loose connective tissue of the neck anteriorly: chest wall laterally: lungs and pleura posteriorly: thoracic spine inferiorly: diaphragm  PathologyBroadly, pathology that affects the mediastinum can be divided into those that result in a focal mass, or those that result in diffuse disease involving the mediastinum.The differential diagnosis of a mediastinal mass is highly dependent on its location within the mediastinum, as this may reveal the structure of origin. Thus, there is a specific differential diagnosis for each compartment: thoracic inlet masses anterior mediastinal masses middle mediastinal masses posterior mediastinal masses In cases where localization is difficult due involvement of multiple compartments, the ITMIG recommends a "center method" technique by which the central point on the axial slice where the lesion appears largest is used for localization.3 Alternatively, a "structure displacement" technique whereby displacement of organs from adjacent compartments may be used to localize the lesion.4 Diffuse mediastinal disease can be separated into groups depending on whether the mediastinal disease is smooth or lobulated: smooth mediastinal lipomatosis mediastinal malignant infiltration mediastinal hemorrhage mediastinitis   lobulated mediastinal lymphadenopathy thymic mass germ cell neoplasm mediastinal vascular abnormality mediastinal neurofibromatosis   Finally, air tracking into the potential mediastinal spaces (pneumomediastinum) may occur when there is rupture of an air-containing structure, penetrating injury, or may be iatrogenic.
__label__Chest __label__Cardiac __label__Vascular The International Thymic Malignancy Interest Group (ITMIG) classification of mediastinal compartments was developed to reflect a division of the mediastinum based on cross-sectional imaging. It was in part an effort to consolidate prior discrepant classification systems in use by different medical specialties. A working group composed of approximately 225 experts in thoracic surgery, medical oncology, diagnostic radiology, and pathology were tasked with forming a practical system for anatomic classification which unified the various systems.ClassificationThe ITMIG classification divides the mediastinum into three compartments: prevascular, visceral and paravertebral 1,2.Prevascular compartmentBoundaries superior: thoracic inlet  inferior: diaphragm  anterior: posterior cortex of the sternum  lateral: parietal mediastinal pleura  posterior: anterior aspect of the pericardium  Contents thymus lymph nodes left brachiocephalic vein  fat Visceral compartmentBoundaries superior: thoracic inlet inferior: diaphragm anterior: posterior boundary of the prevascular compartment posterior: a vertical line connecting a point on each thoracic vertebral body 1 cm posterior to its anterior margin (visceral-paravertebral compartment boundary line) Contents  trachea/carina esophagus lymph nodes heart  ascending aorta; aortic arch; descending thoracic aorta  superior vena cava intrapericardial pulmonary arteries  thoracic duct Paravertebral compartmentBoundaries superior: thoracic inlet inferior: diaphragm anterior: posterior boundaries of the visceral compartment posterolateral: vertical line against the posterior margin of the chest wall at the lateral margin of the thoracic spine Contents thoracic spine and paravertebral soft tissues

It more commonly affects females and patients older than 60 years 1 although this likely represents the population receiving bisphosphonates 3. Clinical presentationMRONJ is a painful process and before osteonecrosis becomes clearly evident the patient may present with the following symptoms and signs 2: periodontal disease and non-healing mucosal ulcers loose teeth soft tissue infections Established MRONJ manifests as necrosis of the jaw with exposed bone. PathologyThe definite pathogenesis of MRONJ has not yet been established but is proposed to be related to bone remodeling suppression and antiangiogenic effects of these medications 3. Medications implicated in the formation of MRONJ include 5,6,8-11: indicated for osteoporosis bisphosphonates IV: zoledronate, ibandronate, pamidronate oral: alendronate, risedronate, clodronate   RANKL inhibitor monoclonal antibodydenosumab    indicated for malignancy or immunosuppression tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) e.g. sunitinib, sorafenib, pazopanib VEGF inhibitor: bevacizumab (humanised monoclonal antibody) mTOR inhibitors, e.g. sirolimus, everolimus, temsirolimus fusion protein: aflibercept   other therapies of less certainty radium-223 anti-TNF agents   LocationThe mandible is affected more commonly than the maxilla (2:1), and they can be involved independently or simultaneously 1,2. As impairment of normal bone remodeling and healing is the postulated mechanism, it is not surprising that the areas most frequently involved are those most likely to have trauma in the form of tooth extraction or the alveolar ridge in edentulous individuals 7.Risk factors treatment for malignancy is a greater risk than osteoporosis recent dental surgery: mainly tooth extraction (~65% of patients) 2,3​,10 risk seems to be higher for cancer than osteoporosis patients 10  if a patient is to be started on high-dose/IV bisphosphonate treatment then ideally any planned dental work should be done prior to this to minimize risk   IV bisphosphonate use 2,3  long-term bisphosphonate use 3  dual pharmacyrisk higher if on a bisphosphonate and antiangiogenic therapy simultaneously 10   concurrent bone metastases or multiple myeloma 1,2  dental or periodontal disease 3injury from poorly fitting dentures  additional possible risk factors in those with cancer 10 HIV anemia diabetes mellitus   Radiographic featuresPlain radiographPlain films and OPGs may not demonstrate early disease 1,3.  When visible, features are non-specific and include 1,7: poorly defined lucent, mixed or sclerotic lesion sequestrum periosteal proliferation destruction of adjacent structures CTIn addition to the aforementioned plain radiographic findings, CT is more likely to demonstrate early changes:  prominence of the periodontal ligament focal sclerosis adjacent to the root of a tooth periosteal reaction Treatment and prognosis specialist maxillofacial/dental management of medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaw is essential treatment is primarily palliativetreat superadded infection, bone necrosis, mitigate painfastidious dental hygiene: including mouthwashes +/- antimicrobials   surgery is generally to be avoided as it may aggravate the necrosis 10  Differential diagnosisradiation necrosis of the jaw (mandibular osteoradionecrosis): virtually indistinguishable clinically and radiologically 2 See alsobisphosphonate-related proximal femoral fracture
__label__Breast The mediolateral oblique (MLO) view is one of the two standard mammographic views, alongside the craniocaudal (CC) view. It is the most important projection as it allows to depict most breast tissue. AdequacyThe representation of the pectoral muscle on the MLO view is a key component in assessing the adequacy of patient positioning and therefore, the adequacy of the film. The amount of visible pectoral muscle determines the amount of breast tissue included in the image, resulting in a decisive quality factor, very important to reduce the number of false negatives and increase the sensitivity of the mammography. Furthermore, as most breast pathology occurs in the upper outer quadrant, it is important that this area is clearly visible on MLO views. Technique The patient is positioned in front of the mammography arm of the hand in question lying at the top of the table top, usually at 45°. There will be a uniform compression on the breast and armpit, making sure that the skin is flat and that there are no skin folds.It must be noted that the standard 45° is not always suitable for all women.  In certain disease processes, the angle can be altered to between  40° and 60°, to maximize the quality of imaging.  Examples of conditions that require angle change includes scapula-humeral disease, kyphosis, scoliosis, pectus.Correctness criteria nipple well aligned pectoral muscle displayed until the level of the posterior nipple line (PNL) presence of submammary angle free  folds and the absence of artifacts Errors to avoid projected behind the line nipple skin  inframammary fold not lying visible in mammograms overlapping structures inclusion of other body parts, e.g. nose, chin, ear, shoulders and hair 
__label__Breast The mediolateral (ML) view is a supplementary mammographic view and shows less breast tissue and pectoral muscle than the mediolateral oblique view (MLO view).TechniqueThe tube is rotated 90 degrees and the lateral aspect of the chest wall is along the bucky edge. The height is at the level of the axilla.The arm of the side being examined is lifted and supported on top of the bucky. The breast is lifted upwards and onwards and compression applied so the nipple is in profile.Criteria for assessing medio lateral viewAn optimal mediolateral view should demonstrate the pectoral muscle, inframammary angle and nipple in profile and display majority of the breast tissue.
__label__Central __label__Nervous __label__System The medulla oblongata (or simply the medulla) is the most caudal part of the brainstem between the pons superiorly and spinal cord inferiorly. It is the transition from the spinal cord to the brain.The medulla contains the vital autonomic cardiovascular and respiratory centers controlling heart rate, blood pressure, and breathing. It is composed of grey matter, cranial nerve (CN) nuclei IX to XII, and white matter tracts 2,3. On this page:  Article: Gross anatomy Blood supply Embryology Related pathology Related articles References   Images:Cases and figures  Gross anatomyThe medulla is approximately 3 cm in length and 2 cm in greatest diameter 2. The caudal border of the medulla is the 1st cervical spinal nerves. The superior broad part of the medulla joins the pons 2,3.Medulla is separated into two main parts: ventral (anterior) medulla which contains the olive, pyramidal tracts, and CN IX to XII rootlets tegmentum (dorsal) medulla which contain the CN nuclei and white matter tracts Ventral medullaPyramids are paired structures located at the medial aspect of the ventral medulla and flank the anterior median fissure. They contain the anterior and lateral corticospinal tracts. At the caudal end of the pyramids, the corticospinal tracts decussate 2,3.Olivary bodies are paired structures located at lateral aspect of ventral medulla, lateral to the pyramids. They are separated from the pyramids by an anterolateral sulcus (pre-olivary sulcus). There is also a post-olivary sulcus lateral to the olivary bodies. Olivary bodies contain the superior and larger inferior olivary nuclei 2.Medulla tegmentumThe dorsal aspect of the medulla contains the posterior median sulcus (most dorsal medial sulcus) and the more lateral posterolateral sulcus. Between these sulci are the fasciculus gracilis and nuclei forming the gracilis tubercle medially and the fasciculus cuneatus and nuclei forming the cuneate tubercle laterally 2,3.Superiorly the dorsal surface of the medulla is slightly depressed, forming the diamond-shaped rhomboid fossa which is the floor of the fourth ventricle. The superior dorsal aspect of the medulla is occupied by the inferior cerebellar peduncle situated between the lower part of the fourth ventricle. The inferior dorsal and lateral aspect of the medulla is surrounded by the cisterna magna (posterior cerebellomedullary cistern), and lateral cerebellomedullary cistern 2,3.The median aperture (foramen of Magendie) and the more superior lateral apertures (foramina of Luschka) open at the level of the pons, with the canals projecting to the level of the medulla region and terminating into the cisterna magna and lateral cerebellomedullary cistern respectively 1.Cranial nervesThe nuclei of the cranial nerves in the medulla originate in the tegmentum, but the nerve roots exit ventrally. Cranial nerves IX and X as well as the roots of XI exit the lateral medulla at the post-olivary sulcus, posterior to olivary bodies. Cranial nerve XII emerges between the pyramid and the olive at the pre-olivary sulcus as a number of rootlets 2,3.Blood supply  posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA) supplies the lateral aspect of the medulla 2,3   anterior spinal artery supplies the entire medial aspect 2,3  direct branches of the distal vertebral artery supplies an area between the other two main arteries 2,3  EmbryologyThe myelencephalon portion of the rhombencephalon (or hindbrain) becomes the medulla.Related pathology  Wallenberg syndrome (also callsed lateral medullary syndrome or PICA syndrome) medial medullary syndrome Wallerian degeneration demyelinating lesions syringobulbia brainstem glioma trauma

On this page:  Article: Epidemiology Clinical presentation Pathology Radiographic features Treatment and prognosis Related articles References   EpidemiologyThey tend to occur more frequently in younger women than other breast cancer types 7. The mean age of presentation varies from 46-54 years but in 10% of cases, they may present in women under 35 years.Clinical presentationClinically, these tumors are characterized by rapid growth and therefore often manifest as palpable masses. Lesions can be quite large at presentation.PathologyMCB typically arises from supporting stromal cells of the breast 3. The World Health Organization (WHO) criteria for diagnosis are “a well-circumscribed carcinoma composed of poorly differentiated cells with scant stroma and prominent lymphoid infiltration”. Large pleomorphic nuclei prominent nucleoli and high mitotic activity may be seen. The histologic appearance of medullary carcinoma can mimic that of poorly differentiated intraductal carcinoma not otherwise specified. Areas of associated necrosis may be present. In familial form of breast cancer with BRCA1 gene mutation medullary and mucinous cancers are more common.There are two types of MCB:  typical type: has to meet the following criteria: a) syncytial growth pattern of poorly differentiated tumor cells with a high mitotic rate b) prominent lymphoplasmacytic reaction with a circumscribed microscopic appearance-inflammatory reaction must involve 75% of the periphery and must be present diffusely throughout the substance of the tumor c) no glandular or fatty breast tissue should be found within the invasive portion of the tumor    atypical type: resembles the usual classic case; it must have at least 75% syncytial growth but does not have the other two features (circumscription and lymphoplasmacytic infiltration) Many medullary carcinomas tend to be estrogen and progesterone receptor negative.Radiographic featuresMammographyTypically seen as a circular/oval type mass lesion with ill-defined or circumscribed margins at mammography. There can be varying degrees of lobulation while calcification is usually not a feature.Breast ultrasoundThe mass can be either homogeneously hyperechoic or hypoechoic with mild heterogeneity 1,2. Enhanced through transmission may be present 2. The level of hypoechogenicity can sometimes be marked 8. Breast MRIMay show diffuse enhancement post contrast.Treatment and prognosisThe prognosis tends to be better than for intraductal carcinoma (NOS).  5-year survival rates of 89-95% have been reported

Biochemical evaluation in the form of preoperative CEA and calcitonin levels is helpful to assess neoplastic cells' functional capacity. Higher levels of these markers roughly correspond to size of tumor and extent of nodal metastasis 7.The extent of radiologic evaluation is variable, depending on suspicion for metastatic disease. Evaluation should uniformly begin with a neck ultrasound, to be supplemented by additional imaging if there are findings of extensive neck disease. Additional imaging may consist of CT of neck and thorax, multiphase CT/MRI of the liver, or bone scan. The efficacy of PET imaging for assessment of metastatic disease is variable, and neither FDG nor fluoro-DOPA imaging is recommended for assessment 8.The standard treatment approach involves surgical resection of all known disease, when feasible. This typically consists of total thyroidectomy and neck dissection 8.The prognosis of MTC is generally worse than papillary and follicular thyroid cancer subtypes 1. 
__label__Oncology __label__Central __label__Nervous __label__System __label__Paediatrics Medulloblastomas are the most common malignant brain tumor of childhood. They most commonly present as midline masses in the roof of the 4th ventricle with associated mass effect and hydrocephalus. Treatment typically consists of surgical resection, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy, with the prognosis strongly influenced by surgical resection, the presence of CSF metastases at the time of diagnosis, and expression of the c-erbB-2 (HER2/neu) oncogene.Although medulloblastoma has been classically thought of as a single entity it is becoming increasingly evident that there are a number of distinct molecular subgroups with, albeit overlapping, clinical, histological and imaging features 8. This has been reflected in the 2016 update of the WHO classification of CNS tumors, which recognizes four molecular subgroups, although it is worth noting that recent publications have identified up to 12 subgroups 15.The 4 molecular subgroups currently recognized in the WHO classification have been named WNT, SHH, Group 3, and Group 4 8. Perhaps counterintuitively what most of us think of as the typical medulloblastoma (a midline tumor in early childhood) is group 4. Further information on the subtypes of medulloblastoma is available in the links below and in the article classification of medulloblastomas. medulloblastoma - WNT medulloblastoma - SHH medulloblastoma - group 3 medulloblastoma - group 4  On this page:  Article: Epidemiology Clinical presentation Pathology Radiographic features Predicting molecular subgroup from imaging Treatment and prognosis History an etymology Differential diagnosis Related articles References   Images: Cases and figures Imaging differential diagnosis   EpidemiologyOverall medulloblastomas account for 12-25 % of all pediatric CNS tumors, and 30-40% of pediatric posterior fossa tumors 1,7. They are also seen in adults but only account for 0.4-1.0% of adult brain tumors 1. Since there are many more adults than children, 14-30% of all medulloblastomas are found in adults.Taken as a group, there is a moderate male predilection with a M:F ratio of 2:1, although this is only true of group 3 and 4 tumors 8. They usually present in childhood with 77% of cases before the age of 19. The median age of diagnosis is 9 years. When diagnosed in adulthood, they typically present in the 3rd and 4th decades and are more likely to arise in atypical locations (see below). When they present in adulthood, there is often a better prognosis. Importantly the age of presentation and gender ratio is influenced by tumor genomics 7-9,12: WNT (least common) children and adults (not seen in infancy) M:F 1:1   SHH infants and adults (rare in children) M:F 1:1   group 3 infants and children (rare in adults) M > F   group 4 (most common) typically children (rare in infants) M:F 2:1   Clinical presentationThe growth of these very cellular tumors is often rapid and accounts for their relatively rapid clinical onset. Typically, presentation occurs over a few weeks with features that are dominated by symptoms of raised intracranial pressure as a result of obstructive hydrocephalus 7. In approximately 40% of patients, there is evidence of CSF seeding at the time of diagnosis 7.PathologyThe tumors, in general, tend to be extremely cellular and are an example of a small round blue cell tumor which results in predictable imaging features. They are categorized as CNS primitive neuroectodermal tumors (WHO grade IV).AssociationsMedulloblastomas are associated with a number of syndromes, including: Coffin-Siris syndrome Cowden syndrome Gardner syndrome Gorlin syndrome Li-Fraumeni syndrome Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome Turcot syndrome L-2-hydoxyglutaric aciduria Radiographic featuresThe radiographic features are strongly influenced by the histological type and molecular subtype of the tumor. Many of the imaging characteristics can, however, be remembered by thinking of medulloblastoma as a small round blue cell tumor. Overall the vast majority (94%) of medulloblastomas arise in the cerebellum and the majority of these, from the vermis (75%). They tend to protrude into the fourth ventricle from its roof, and may even grow directly into the brainstem 1,7. This pattern is particularly common in group 3 and group 4 and in some SHH subgroup tumors 10. Other areas are less common and are seen more frequently in older children and adults. In such cases, the tumor is also more likely to be poorly marginated and demonstrate larger cyst formation 7. Adult medulloblastomas are usually located laterally, in the cerebellar hemispheres, with only 28% centered in the vermis; these are most commonly of the SHH subgroup 10. Cerebellar peduncle epicenter is almost exclusively seen in the relatively indolent WNT subgroup 8-10. CTOn CT, medulloblastomas often appear as a mass arising from the vermis, resulting in effacement of the fourth ventricle / basal cisterns and obstructive hydrocephalus. They can also occur more laterally in the cerebellum.They are usually hyperdense (90%) and cysts formation/necrosis is common (40-50%), especially in older patients. Calcification is seen in 10-20% of cases 7.Enhancement is present in over 90% of cases and is usually prominent 7.MRI  T1hypointense to grey matter   T1 C+ (Gd) overall 90% enhance, often heterogeneously group 4 tumors tend to enhance less 10     T2/FLAIR overall are iso to hyperintense to grey matter heterogeneous due to calcification, necrosis and cyst formation surrounding edema is common 10     DWI/ADC high DWI signal ("restricted diffusion") low ADC values (lower than normal cerebellum e.g. ~550 x 10-6 mm2/s) 11     MR spectroscopy elevated choline decreased NAA   MRI is able to delineate the fourth ventricle and subarachnoid space to a much greater degree than CT. Although medulloblastomas project into the fourth ventricle, unlike ependymomas they do not usually extend into the basal cisterns 7.As CSF seeding is common at presentation, imaging with contrast of the whole neuraxis is recommended to identify drop metastases and leptomeningeal spread. Although rare, extraneural spread is reported.Predicting molecular subgroup from imagingSo if all this sounds confusing, that's because it is. Molecular subgroups, histology, location, appearance, and demographics all interact, but this notwithstanding, you can make some fairly robust predictions based on imaging when taking all of these together 10. Location is the key to this approach.  cerebellar pedunclevery likely WNT subgroup and therefore best prognosis  cerebellar hemisphere very likely SHH subgroup and therefore intermediate prognosis likely desmoplastic/nodular/medulloblastoma with extensive nodularity (MBEN)   midline may be group 3, group 4 or SHH typically infants with a tumor with ill-defined margins but prominent enhancement: likely group 3 (or SHH) and therefore worst prognosis typically children with a tumor with well-defined margins but mild or no enhancement: likely group 4 and therefore slightly better prognosis adults with variably defined and variably enhancing tumors: most likely SHH; hemorrhage raises the probability of group 4 13​     ​​MR spectroscopy may also be distinctive 5,14: group 3 or 4 taurine peak  high creatine   SHH little or no taurine low creatine   Treatment and prognosisTreatment typically consists of surgical resection, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy. In general, the tumors are quite radiosensitive.Cerebellar mutism syndrome may occur after surgical resection of medulloblastoma 16.Prognosis is most strongly influenced by molecular subtype 7-9: WNT: very good SHH: infants good, others intermediate group 3: poor group 4: intermediate Traditionally, and still relevant in addition to molecular characteristics, prognosis if considered poor if young age at diagnosis (<3 years of age), incomplete surgical resection (>1.5 cm3 residual), and presence of CSF metastases at the time of diagnosis; common in infants and children (~25%) and uncommon in adults (~2%)1,12. Histological features also have an effect on prognosis with desmoplastic and nodular histology having a better outlook than large cell or anaplastic histologic features 12.Expression of the c-erbB-2 (HER2/neu) oncogene is useful in the staging of medulloblastomas. Increased c-erbB-2 expression reflects an increase in the proliferative activity of a tumor (widely used in breast cancer staging). no CSF metastases, complete surgical resection and negative c-erbB-2 expression: 5-year-survival 100% no CSF metastases, complete surgical resection and positive c-erbB-2 expression: 5-year-survival 54% CSF metastases and/or incomplete surgical resection: 5-year-survival 20% History an etymologyIn 1925, Bailey and Cushing described the first cases of medulloblastomas 1.Differential diagnosisIn the pediatric population consider:  ependymoma usually arises from the floor of the 4th ventricle typically squeezes out the foramen of Luschka does not usually cause as much diffusion restriction    atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumor very young children aggressive    pilocytic astrocytomausually cystic   brainstem glioma (exophytic)  choroid plexus papilloma (CPP) : more common in lateral ventricles in children In the adult population consider: cerebellar metastasis hemangioblastoma choroid plexus papilloma ependymoma 
__label__Central __label__Nervous __label__System Medulloblastoma - group 3 tumors are malignant tumors of the central nervous system, and one of the most common pediatric tumors.

__label__Central __label__Nervous __label__System Medulloblastoma - sonic hedgehog (SHH) subgroup tumors are malignant tumors of the central nervous system. They are the second most common medulloblastoma subgroup (after group 4) and are approximately as common as group 3. They are found most commonly in adults and infants, but infrequently in children. Although they can arise from the vermis of the cerebellum, as is typical for group 3 and 4, they are most frequently located laterally within the cerebellar hemispheres.  On this page:  Article: Epidemiology Pathology Radiographic features Treatment and prognosis Related articles References   Images:Cases and figures  EpidemiologySHH subgroup tumors account for approximately 27% of all medulloblastomas, and, unlike group 3 and 4, have no particular predilection for males, with a ~1:1 male to female ratio 1-2,4. They are most frequently encountered in adults (>16 years) and infants (<4 years) but are uncommon in children 1-2,4. PathologySHH medulloblastomas can demonstrate various histologies, with classic, large cell/anaplastic and desmoplastic/nodular/medulloblastoma with extensive nodularity (MBEN) all encountered 2. Importantly, almost all desmoplastic/nodular/medulloblastoma with extensive nodularity (MBEN) tumors are SHH subtype 2. Recently subtypes of SHH have been defined and termed SHHα, SHHβ, SHHγ and SHH∆ 4: SHHα: typically in children with TP53 mutations SHHβ: typically in infants, poor prognosis SHHγ: typically in infants, good prognosis SHH∆: typically in adults with TERT promoter gene mutations Radiographic featuresThe radiographic features of SHH subgroup tumors are variable, to a degree depending on histological subtype. When they are of classic or large cell/anaplastic histology and located in the midline, they are essentially indistinguishable from group 3 and group 4 tumors 3. The desmoplastic/nodular/medulloblastoma with extensive nodularity (MBEN) tumors, on the other hand, tend to occur in the lateral parts of the cerebellar hemispheres 3. For more details on radiographic features, please refer to the general article on medulloblastoma. Treatment and prognosisSurgery is the first line of therapy (as is the case in all subgroups) with the aim being histological proof, molecular subtyping and maximal tumor resection, with adjuvant therapy depending on an overall risk profile (see general article on medulloblastoma) 2. The incidence of CNS metastatic disease in the SHH subgroup at diagnosis is relatively common in infants (17%) and children (22%) but is uncommon in adults 1. SHH tumors have intermediate prognosis compared to other subtypes of medulloblastoma; that is, better than group 3 tumors, but significantly worse than WNT subtypes.

This accounts for the location of these tumors 15: foramen of Luschka: 75% fourth ventricle: 70%  cisterna magna: 30% cerebellopontine angle cistern: 20% WNT tumors are almost invariably (97%) of classic histology, with the remainder being of large cell/anaplastic morphology 1,2. Interestingly even those with large cell/anaplastic histology have a good prognosis, which is not the case with other subgroups 2. Most WNT medulloblastomas are sporadic, most frequently the result of mutations of CTNNB1 which encodes for beta-catenin, although numerous other mutations have been described 2. In patients with Turcot syndrome the mutation is of the APC gene 2. Radiographic featuresInterestingly, and helpful in preoperative assessment, the WNT subgroup has a distinct predilection for the cerebellar peduncle, bulging into the cerebellopontine angle, which is not usually encountered in other molecular subgroups.

It was initially suggested that irritation of the peritoneal surfaces by a hard, solid ovarian tumor could stimulate peritoneal fluid production. The pathophysiology of the pleural effusion is also speculative with some suggesting ascitic fluid being transferred via trans-diaphragmatic lymphatic channels into the pleural space.DistributionThe pleural fluid tends to be right sided in a majority (~60-70%) of cases.Treatment and prognosisThe condition is benign and the ascites and pleural effusion resolve after resection of the primary pelvic tumor.History and etymologyNamed after Joe Vincent Meigs (1892-1963), an American (US) obstetrician and gynecologist  4.Differential diagnosisGeneral considerations include:  malignant ascites and pleural effusion in the presence of an aggressive ovarian tumor  pseudo-Meigs syndrome: benign reversible pleural effusion in the presence of a primary tumor other than solid ovarian tumors, e.g. broad ligament leiomyoma  
__label__Central __label__Nervous __label__System A number of pathological entities affecting the central nervous system contain melanin. They can be divided into primary and secondary melanocytic lesions. PrimaryPrimary melanocytic lesions arise from melanin-containing neural crest cells which are located in the leptomeninges.  They include 1-3: diffuse melanosis (seen in neurocutaneous melanosis) meningeal melanocytosis meningeal melanomatosis   melanocytoma primary meningeal malignant melanoma In addition to these primary lesions which arise from melanin-containing cells, a number of other tumors of the CNS can rarely contain melanin. These include 3: melanotic meningioma melanotic schwannoma melanotic medulloblastoma melanotic differentiation of low-grade gliomas craniopharyngiomas may rarely contain melanin melanotic differentiation of a gliosarcoma (single case report 4) SecondarySecondary melanocytic lesions are far more common and represent metastatic malignant melanoma.

On this page:  Article: Epidemiology Clinical presentation Pathology Radiographic features Treatment and prognosis History and etymology Differential diagnosis References   EpidemiologyMost cases are diagnosed during infancy, usually within the first 6 months of life 1,2. No convincing sex predilection has been reported 1,2. Clinical presentationThe vast majority of cases are craniofacial with more than two thirds of reported cases involve the maxilla 1,2. Clinical presentation is usually with a rapidly growing mass, only sometimes obviously melanotic 1,2. In some instances the mass results in displacement of teeth and distortion of the nasal and oral cavities, in turn resulting in feeding difficulties 1. PathologyMacroscopic appearanceBlue-black discolouration of the tumor occurs secondary to melanin pigment produced by the tumor.Microscopic appearanceNon-encapsulated mass composed of abundant large epithelioid cells that contain melanin.

On this page:  Article: Epidemiology Clinical presentation Pathology Radiographic features Treatment and prognosis History and etymology Differential diagnosis References   Images:Cases and figures  EpidemiologyMelioidosis is a disease of the monsoon season in the tropics with a greatest prevalence in the northeastern provinces of Thailand and the 'Top End' of the Northern Territory and Queensland in Australia 6. It is unknown in temperate zones, other than when seen in returned travelers, and as such is not well known to many physicians despite the fact that in hyperendemic areas (see above) up to 20% of community-acquired septicemia is due to Burkholderia pseudomallei 6.Risk factorsNumerous risk factors have been identified most of which are associated with a degree of impaired host defenses (either immunological or structural) 6: metabolic/immunological diabetes mellitus excessive alcohol consumption chronic renal failure glucocorticosteroid excess (iatrogenic or Cushing syndrome) HIV/AIDS  leukemia and lymphoma    chronic structural pulmonary diseases chronic obstructive pulmonary disease idiopathic pulmonary hemosiderosis cystic fibrosis   congestive cardiac failure neoplasms kava (Piper methysticum) ingestion occupationrice farmer  Clinical presentationAs many different organ systems can be affected, presentation is similarly variable, and patients may present with acute, subacute or chronic illness, each with different radiological findings.The lungs are the most commonly affected organ, and most commonly patients present with an acute pulmonary illness, often dramatic and often clinically more pronounced than imaging or physical findings would suggest 4,6.PathologyThe bacterium Burkholderia pseudomallei is an environmental saprophyte found in soil and stagnant water 6. The organism can enter the body directly though cuts/wounds or be inhaled in dust 6.The organism survives within the cytoplasm of macrophages which ingest it, and it may thus remain dormant for many years 6.Although the majority of infective changes visible on radiology are due to abscess formation, clinical presentation has been thought to be due, in part at least, to an endotoxin. This would explain how the clinical presentation can be more severe than would be expected from physical or imaging findings alone, although animal models have thus far failed to identify such a toxin 4,6.Radiographic featuresPulmonary manifestationsAcuteIn acute disease, imaging may demonstrate multiple small pulmonary nodules (haematogenous spread), and multilobar infiltrates, typically starting in the upper lobes. This may rapidly progress resulting in cavitation or pulmonary abscess formation 6.Subacute to chronicIn subacute and chronic forms, the radiological features are similar (mixed nodular or patchy opacities), although in the chronic form, progression is slower.Rupture of a cavity or lung abscess into the pleural space may result in a pneumothorax or hydropneumothorax. Pleural effusions are uncommon and often associated with lower lobe involvement.Head and neck manifestationsSuppurative parotitis is seen particularly in Thai children and presents as an abscess 6.Abdominal manifestationsMelioidosis can also occur in the visceral organs of the abdomen, most commonly in the liver and spleen. Appearances can range from a large 'honeycomb' type abscess to a multitude of microabscesses. It can also occur, albeit far less commonly, in the pancreas, kidneys and even prostate gland (higher incidence in Australia than elsewhere) 3,6.Central nervous system manifestationsCentral nervous system involvement (see neuromelioidosis) is uncommon and can take many forms, ranging from cerebral abscesses / cerebritis / encephalitis to cranial nerve palsies and even dural venous sinus thrombosis 4.Treatment and prognosisTreatment depends on the location of the infection and severity of systemic symptoms. Intravenous antibiotics are usually required and care must be taken as the organism is resistant to many antibiotics. Choices include ceftazidime or meropenem with co-trimoxazole 6.Intensive care treatment will be required for cases of septicemia and any abscess needs to be drained surgically.The prognosis depends on the clinical presentation and organs involved, and ranges from very high to very low mortality 6: septicemia (disseminated): 87% mortality septicemia (non-disseminated): 17% mortality localized infection: 9% mortality transient bacteremia: 0% mortality History and etymologyMelioidosis was first recognized in an opiate addict in Rangoon, Burma in 1912 5,6.Differential diagnosisThe differential depends entirely on the location and is too diverse to be listed here. In general terms it falls into two broad groups: non-infective conditions which mimic abscesses (e.g. cavitating lung cancer, high grade gliomas) other infections (e.g. tuberculosis, amoebic abscess). Based on the fact that the lungs are the most commonly affected organ, and shared epidemiology, tuberculosis is the most significant differential diagnosis.

__label__Musculoskeletal __label__Paediatrics The mendosal suture (also known as the accessory occipital suture) is a normal calvarial suture.Gross anatomyThe suture extends through the occipital bone, lying superior to the occipitomastoid suture and inferomedial to the lambdoid suture. It closes in utero or in the first few days of life. It is usually seen bilaterally but can be unilateral.Variant anatomyThe occipital bone has complex development, ossifying from six centers. The foramen magnum is surrounded by four ossification centers. On each side are the exoccipitals, ventrally located, is the basioccipital, and dorsally, the supraoccipital center contains the midline occipital fissure which can sometimes persist antenatally. This pattern of development can, therefore, give rise to numerous accessory sutures that could be mistaken for fractures especially with plain film evaluation alone. If the supraoccipital center doesn't fuse, an ossicle remains termed the supraoccipital bone (or Kerckring bone).An accessory occipital suture can occasionally persist into childhood, however the vast majority close before 6 years of age. One study of 500 dried skulls from adults and children in an Indian subcontinent population demonstrated a mendosal suture in 3% of skulls 1.

__label__Central __label__Nervous __label__System Meningeal enhancement is a generic term related to the enhancement of the membranes that envelop the brain and spinal cord. Due the anatomical features, this enhancement can be divided in two subtypes:  leptomeningeal enhancement (pial or pial-arachnoid enhancement)  pachymeningeal enhancement (dura-arachnoid enhancement 2) Combined pachymeningeal and leptomeningeal enhancement may occur, usually being focal and associated with a vascularized extra-axial tumor (e.g. metastases and lymphoma) or inflammatory process (e.g. TB and sarcoidosis).TerminologyIt is important to note that the thin arachnoid membrane is attached to the inner surface of the dura mater, and so the pachymeningeal pattern of enhancement can also be described as a dura-arachnoid enhancement 1. On the other hand, the enhancement of the brain surface is also called as pial or pial-arachnoid enhancement, often referred to as leptomeningeal enhancement 1.
__label__Oncology __label__Central __label__Nervous __label__System Meningeal hemangiopericytomas are rare tumors of the meninges, now considered to be aggressive versions of solitary fibrous tumors of the dura, often presenting as a large and locally aggressive dural mass, frequently extending through the skull vault. They are difficult to distinguish on imaging from the far more common meningioma but are treated similarly with surgical resection with or without radiotherapy to reduce the risk of recurrence, which is high. For a general discussion of non-meningeal hemangiopericytomas please refer to the general article on hemangiopericytoma. On this page:  Article: Epidemiology Clinical presentation Pathology Radiographic features Treatment and prognosis Differential diagnosis Related articles References   Images: Cases and figures Imaging differential diagnosis   EpidemiologyHemangiopericytomas account for less than 1% of all intracranial tumors 1. They are typically encountered in younger adults (30-50 years) with up to 10% being diagnosed in children 3. There is a slight male predilection (M:F 1.4:1) 3,6. Clinical presentationClinical presentation is usually due to mass effect and will vary depending on location. Headache, seizures, focal neurological dysfunction may all be presenting features 3. Additionally, in up to 20% of cases, these tumors can metastasize systemically, typically to liver, lung and bone 1,3,6.PathologyHemangiopericytomas were previously classified as angioblastic sub-type meningiomas, then considered to arise from smooth muscle perivascular pericytes of dural capillaries (pericytes of Zimmerman) 3, but the most recent studies suggest that these lesions are actually arising from fibroblast and are in the spectrum of the solitary fibrous tumors of the dura 4. This is further supported by the fact that both entities share a similar genetic alteration: genomic inversion of 12q13 locus resulting in the fusion of NAB2 and STAT6 genes, the latter expressed and able to be assessed using immunohistochemistry techniques 6. In fact, in the 2016 update to the WHO classification of CNS tumors, the two entities have been combined 5. Solitary fibrous tumors of the dura are WHO I grade one lesion, whereas hemangiopericytomas are WHO grade II or III (anaplastic) tumors 6. Microscopic appearanceHemangiopericytomas are highly cellular tumors with frequent mitoses (grade II <5 per 10 HPF; grade III ≥5 per 10 HPF) and often with areas of necrosis 6.  The cells are separated by a limited amount of delicate reticulin fibers and have numerous 'staghorn' thin-walled branching vessels, the latter a feature shared by solitary fibrous tumors of the dura 6. ImmunophenotypeIdeally, the diagnosis is confirmed by assessing for STAT6 expression by immunohistochemistry or identifying NAB2-STAT6 fusion 6. Hemangiopericytomas have a number of useful immunohistochemical markers 6:  STAT6: positive CD34: positive vimentin: positive Ki-67 proliferation index is typically around 10% 6. Radiographic featuresHemangiopericytomas are almost always solitary, usually supratentorial masses, often lobulated in contour. They are highly vascular and have a tendency to erode adjacent bone 3.Another common location is the posterior fossa in the posterior occipital region.CT vivid enhancement erosion of adjacent bone no hyperostosis no calcification MRIFeatures on various sequences include  T1: isointense to grey matter  T1 C+ (Gd) vivid enhancement heterogeneous may have a narrow base of dural attachment  dural tail sign is seen, more commonly in grade II tumors   ​T2 isointense to grey matter multiple flow voids on MRI (need to distinguish from the spoke-wheel appearance of meningioma) adjacent brain edema frequently present    MR spectroscopy high myoinositol 3  absent alanine peak (present in meningiomas) 3     DWI intermediate restricted diffusion (less than meningioma)  minimum ADC ~ 1100 (+/- 130) x 10-6 mm2/s    Angiography ECA, ICA and vertebral supply common highly vascular corkscrew arteries fluffy tumor stain lack of early draining veins 3  useful for pre-operative embolization assessment of dural venous sinus involvement  Treatment and prognosisTotal surgical excision is recommended, with pre-operative catheter embolization helpful in limiting blood loss 3. Adjuvant radiotherapy to reduce the incidence of recurrence has also been advocated 1,3. Differential diagnosisThe main differential diagnosis is that of meningioma although all other dural masses should be considered. Distinguishing a hemangiopericytoma from a meningioma can be difficult as they have similar appearances on both CT and MRI.  meningioma older patients (>50 years of age) smoother central vascular spoke-wheel vascular supply less likely to erode adjacent bone more likely to cause hyperostosis more likely to be multiple very unlikely to metastasize usually, have a broad dural attachment and dural tail  MRS: alanine peak, absent myoinositol peak immunohistochemistry: EMA positive, CD34 and STAT6 negative

Patients rarely present with subarachnoid hemorrhage.When these tumors are found in the trigeminal cave, then they are associated with a nevus of Ota, a benign dermal melanocytic nevus involving the ophthalmic (Va) and maxillary (Vb) divisions of the trigeminal nerve (CN V) 4,5. PathologyMeningeal melanocytomas are most commonly found in the cervical and thoracic regions (intrathecal-extramedullary). Within the spine, melanocytomas present as intradural masses, and maybe intradural extramedullary or rarely intramedullary. They are most commonly found in the upper cervical region, as melanocytes are most concentrated at this location 3. Less commonly they occur in the intracranial compartment 4. Macroscopic appearanceMacroscopically, meningeal melanocytomas are circumscribed tumors. The degree of pigmentation is variable, ranging from black to non-pigmented 4. Microscopic appearanceOn light microscopy, there are spindle, fusiform, epithelioid, or polygonal cells without evidence of anaplasia. The cells have eosinophilic cytoplasm with a variable content of melanin pigment. Mitotic figures are rare or absent and necrosis and hemorrhage are generally not seen 1,4. These features help in differentiating melanocytomas from metastatic or primary melanomas of the central nervous system.ImmunophenotypeAs is the case with other primary melanocytic tumors of the CNS, meningeal melanocytomas usually demonstrate the following immunohistochemical staining 4:   HMB45: positive  melan-A: positive  MITF: positive  S100: positive  vimentin: variable  neuron-specific enolase: variable  GFAP, NFPs, cytokeratins, EMA: usually negative Radiographic featuresThe preoperative diagnosis of meningeal melanocytoma is often difficult, as the clinical and neuroradiological features of the tumor are non-specific 2.CTWell-defined, isodense to hyperdense, homogenous, contrast-enhancing lesion 1.MRIThe MRI appearance of meningeal melanocytomas is variable, depending on the amount of melanin content present.Signal characteristics include:  T1: isointense or hyperintense  T2: isointense or hypointense  T1 C+ (Gd): heterogeneous enhancement  T2* GRE: may show blooming of low signal Treatment and prognosisAlthough classified as benign, meningeal melanocytomas may behave aggressively and a limited number may transform to malignant melanomas 1-4. Complete excision is the treatment of choice, however, this often not possible as intra-operative hemorrhage may be severe. Furthermore, local recurrence has been reported even after gross total removal 1. Due to the risk of tumor recurrence even after complete excision, adjuvant radiation therapy is advised in cases of both complete and incomplete resection 2.Differential diagnosisImaging differential considerations include: other melanotic lesions melanotic meningioma intracranial metastatic melanoma   hemorrhagic lesions hemangioblastoma  hemorrhagic metastases   cavernous malformation rounded regions of heterogeneous signal intensity on T1 and T2 weighted images due to blood products of varying ages (“popcorn” appearance) hemosiderin rim on T2 weighted images hypointense “blooming” on gradient echo sequences minimal to no enhancement     In the spine, in addition to the lesions above, consider: hemorrhagic intramedullary spinal tumors ependymoma astrocytoma  
__label__Central __label__Nervous __label__System Meningeal melanocytosis is a benign form of primary melanocytic tumor of the CNS that represents proliferation of melanocytic cells within the subarachnoid space 1. When associated with cutaneous melanocytic lesions, the conditions is known as neurocutaneous syndrome 3.Meningeal melanocytosis is related to the more aggressive meningeal melanomatosis. As imaging is very similar, they are discussed together in the article on meningeal melanomatosis.PathologyThe melanocytic cells found in the subarachnoid space are believed to arise from leptomeningeal melanocytes of neural crest origin 1. Sometimes meningeal melanocytosis can extend to involve the perivascular spaces, importantly without direct invasion into the brain 1. The cells appear bland without atypia, necrosis or significant mitotic activity. If these features are found then a diagnosis of meningeal melanomatosis should be made 1. 
__label__Oncology __label__Central __label__Nervous __label__System Meningeal melanomatosis is an aggressive version of meningeal melanocytosis and one of the recognized primary melanocytic tumors of the CNS. It represents proliferation of melanocytic cells within the subarachnoid space 1. There is a strong association with cutaneous melanocytic lesions, in which case it is known as neurocutaneous syndrome 3.Meningeal melanomatosis is the aggressive form of meningeal melanocytosis. Together they have frequently been referred to as diffuse melanosis although nomenclature seems somewhat variable.  On this page:  Article: Clinical presentation Pathology Radiographic features Differential diagnosis References   Clinical presentationUsually, the disease is discovered in childhood due to hydrocephalus from blocked subarachnoid and perivascular spaces. PathologyThe melanocytic cells found in the subarachnoid space are believed to arise from leptomeningeal melanocytes of neural crest origin 1. They range in thickness from bulky black cellular material entirely filling the subarachnoid space, to subtle clouding of the meninges 1.These cells frequently extend to involve the perivascular spaces, often with direct invasion into the brain, a feature that is helpful in distinguishing melanomatosis from meningeal melanocytosis 1. Other features also reflect the more aggressive nature of melanomatosis: cellular atypia, high mitotic rate and necrosis.Radiographic featuresImaging features are dominated by leptomeningeal enhancement and abnormal signal, and consequent abnormal CSF flow resulting in hydrocephalus and syringomyelia.CThyperdensity (due to melanin) outlining sulciMRI melanin may be seen on unenhanced T1W MRI as hyperintensity diffuse enhancement of meninges in brain and spine (20%) Differential diagnosisOn CT hyperdensity within sulci on CT can mimic subarachnoid hemorrhage.In addition to leptomeningeal dissemination or more aggressive primary or secondary melanocytic tumors of the CNS, leptomeningeal carcinomatosis, meningitis and even diffuse leptomeningeal glioneuronal tumor should be considered.

__label__Oncology __label__Central __label__Nervous __label__System Meningiomas are extra-axial tumors and represent the most common tumor of the meninges. They are a non-glial neoplasm that originates from the meningocytes or arachnoid cap cells of the meninges and are located anywhere that meninges are found, and in some places where only rest cells are presumed to be located. Although they are usually easily diagnosed and are typically benign with a low rate of recurrence following surgery, there are a large number of histological variants with variable imaging features and, in some instances, more aggressive biological behavior.A broad division of meningiomas is into primary intradural (which may or may not have a secondary extradural extension) and primary extradural (rare) 18. They can also be classified according to the location (e.g. spinal, intraosseous, intraventricular, etc.), by histological variants (e.g. clear cell, rhabdoid, etc.), and by etiology (e.g. radiation-induced, etc.).Typical meningiomas appear as dural-based masses isointense to grey matter on both T1 and T2 weighted imaging enhancing vividly on both MRI and CT. Some of the variants as mentioned earlier can, however, vary dramatically in their imaging appearance.This article is a general discussion of meningioma focusing on typical primary intradural meningiomas and the imaging findings of intracranial disease. For spinal and primary extradural tumors refer to spinal meningioma and primary extradural meningioma articles respectively. Many of the histological variants are also discussed separately. Rarely (e.g. 1-2% of cases 27) meningiomas may also arise at ectopic sites (ectopic primary meningioma) such as in head and neck, orbit, nose, paranasal sinus, oropharynx and even places such as the lung. On this page:  Article: Epidemiology Clinical presentation Pathology Radiographic features Treatment and prognosis History and etymology Differential diagnosis Related articles References   Images:Cases and figures  EpidemiologyMeningiomas are more common in women, with a ratio of 2:1 intracranially and 4:1 in the spine. Atypical and malignant meningiomas are slightly more common in males. They are uncommon in patients before the age of 40 and should raise suspicion of neurofibromatosis type 2 when found in young patients.Clinical presentationMany small meningiomas are found incidentally and are entirely asymptomatic. Often they cause concern as they are mistakenly deemed to be the cause of vague symptoms, most frequently headaches. Larger tumors or those with adjacent edema or abutting particularly sensitive structures can present with a variety of symptoms. Most common presentations include 8: headache: 36% paresis: 22% change in mental status: 21% Meningiomas may also become clinically apparent due to mass effect depending on their location: supratentorial: 85-90% 8 parasagittal, convexities: 45%seizures and hemiparesis  sphenoid ridge: 15-20%  olfactory groove/planum sphenoidale: 10%anosmia (usually not recognized)  juxtasellar: 5-10% visual field defects cranial nerve deficits     infratentorial: 5-10% obstructive hydrocephalus cranial nerve deficits   miscellaneous intradural: <5% intraventricular meningioma optic nerve meningioma pineal gland Parinaud syndrome obstructive hydrocephalus     Occasionally transosseous or intraosseous involvement with prominent hyperostosis may result in local mass effect (e.g. proptosis).Although dural venous sinus invasion and occlusion does occur, it usually occurs very gradually. Therefore most cases of venous invasion are asymptomatic as collateral veins have had time to enlarge.PathologyMeningiomas are thought to arise from meningocytes or arachnoid cap cells, which themselves arise from pluripotential mesenchymal progenitor cells, which accounts for the sometimes unusual location of primary extradural tumors 18,19.Although the majority of tumors are sporadic, they are also seen in the setting of previous cranial irradiation and of course in patients with neurofibromatosis type II (Merlin gene on Chromosome 22). Additionally, meningiomas demonstrate estrogen and progesterone sensitivity and may grow during pregnancy.GradingGrading of meningiomas follows the WHO classification for CNS tumors and includes both usual histological features (e.g. mitotic index) as well as a number of histological subtypes, some of which have been associated with more aggressive behavior 7,11,23: grade I: 'benign" (70%)  transitional meningioma (40%): mixed histology, typically containing meningothelial and fibrous components  meningothelial meningioma (17%)  fibrous meningioma (7%) microcystic meningioma psammomatous meningioma  angiomatous meningioma * secretory meningioma metaplastic meningioma lymphoplasmacytic-rich meningioma   grade II: "atypical" (30%) clear cell meningioma chordoid meningioma atypical by histological criteria (29%) 11 4 to 19 mitoses per ten high-power fields infiltration into brain parenchyma ** 3 or more of the following 5 histologic features: necrosis, sheet-like growth, small cell change, increased cellularity, prominent nucleoli     grade III: "anaplastic" or "malignant" (~1%) rhabdoid meningioma papillary meningioma  anaplastic by histological criteria 11 obvious malignant features similar to those seen in melanoma, carcinoma, or high-grade sarcoma 20 or more mitosis per ten high-power fields     * Hemangiopericytomas was, until 1993, considered angiomatous meningiomas, but in 2007 WHO classification of CNS tumors they were classified as a separate entity under "Other neoplasms related to the meninges". This again changed in 2016 when the classification was updated. Hemangiopericytomas and solitary fibrous tumors of the dura are considered different manifestations of the same disease, listed under "mesenchymal, non-meningothelial tumors" as a single entry. ** It is important to note, when reading older literature, that in the WHO 2007 classification, infiltration into brain parenchyma of an otherwise "benign" grade I tumor was sufficient to designate it a grade II tumor. As such, the incidence of grade II tumors increased to ~30% 11.MacroscopicIn general, there are two main macroscopic forms easily recognized in imaging studies: globose: rounded, well defined dural masses, likened to the appearance of a fried egg seen in profile (the most common presentation)  en plaque: extensive regions of dural thickening The cut surface reflects the various histologies encountered, ranging from very soft to extremely firm in fibrous or calcified tumors. They are usually light tan in coloring, although again this will depend on histological subtypes.Radiographic featuresIn addition to histological variants, many of which have 'atypical' imaging appearances, a number of 'special examples' of meningiomas are best discussed separately. These include: burnt out meningioma cystic meningiomas intraosseous meningioma intraventricular meningioma optic nerve sheath meningioma radiation-induced meningioma The remainder of this section focuses on more typical imaging appearances of run-of-the-mill meningiomas.Plain radiographPlain films no longer have a role in the diagnosis or management of meningiomas. Historically a number of features were observed, including: enlarged meningeal artery grooves hyperostosis or lytic regions calcification displacement of calcified pineal gland/choroid plexus due to mass effect CTCT is often the first modality employed to investigate neurological signs or symptoms, and often is the modality which detects an incidental lesion: non-contrast CT 60% slightly hyperdense to normal brain, the rest are more isodense 20-30% have some calcification 8    post-contrast CT 72% brightly and homogeneously contrast enhance 8  malignant or cystic variants demonstrate more heterogeneity/less intense enhancement    hyperostosis (5%) 23 typical for meningiomas that abut the base of the skull need to distinguish reactive hyperostosis from: direct skull vault invasion by adjacent meningioma primary intraosseous meningioma     enlargement of the paranasal sinuses (pneumosinus dilatans) has also been suggested to be associated with anterior cranial fossa meningiomas 20  lytic/destructive regions are seen particularly in higher grade tumors but should make one suspect alternative pathology (e.g. hemangiopericytoma or metastasis) ref  MRIAs is the case with most other intracranial pathology, MRI is the investigation of choice for the diagnosis and characterization of meningiomas. When appearance and location are typical, the diagnosis can be made with a very high degree of certainty. In some instances, however, the appearances are atypical and careful interpretation is needed to make a correct preoperative diagnosis.Meningiomas typically appear as extra-axial masses with a broad dural base. They are usually homogeneous and well-circumscribed, although many variants are encountered. It seems that the signal intensity of meningiomas on T2-weighted images correlates with the histological subtypes 29.Signal characteristicsSignal characteristics of typical meningiomas include:  T1 usually isointense to grey matter (60-90%) 3,8,13  hypointense to grey matter (10-40%): particularly fibrous, psammomatous variants    T1 C+ (Gd): usually intense and homogeneous enhancement  T2 usually isointense to grey matter (~50%) 3,8,13  hyperintense to grey matter (35-40%) usually correlates with a soft texture and hypervascular tumors 13  seen in microcystic, secretory, cartilaginous (metaplastic) choroid and angiomatous variants 12    hypointense to grey matter (10-15%): compared to grey matter and usually correlates with harder texture and more fibrous and calcified contents    DWI/ADC: atypical and malignant subtypes may show greater than expected restricted diffusion although recent work suggests that this is not useful in prospectively predicting histological grade 15,16   MR spectroscopy: usually it does not play a significant role in diagnosis but can help distinguish meningiomas from mimics. Features include: increase in alanine (1.3-1.5 ppm) increased glutamine/glutamate  increased choline (Cho): cellular tumor absent or significantly reduced N-acetylaspartate (NAA): non-neuronal origin absent or significantly reduced creatine (Cr)    MR perfusion: good correlation between volume transfer constant (k-trans) and histological grade 28  Helpful imaging signsA number of helpful imaging signs have been described, including:  CSF cleft sign, which is not specific for meningioma, but helps establish the mass to be extra-axial; loss of this can be seen in grade II and grade III which may suggest brain parenchyma invasion  dural tail is seen in 60-72% 2 (note that a dural tail is also seen in other processes)  sunburst or spoke-wheel appearance of the vessels white matter buckling sign arterial narrowing typically seen in meningiomas which encase arteries useful sign in parasellar tumors, in distinguishing a meningioma from a pituitary macroadenoma; the latter typically does not narrow vessels   EdemaMore than half of the meningiomas demonstrate a variable amount of vasogenic edema in adjacent brain parenchyma 24. Correlation between age, gender, tumor size, rapid growth, location (convexity and parasagittal > elsewhere), histologic type, and invasion in the case of malignant meningiomas have been suggested in literature but not yet confirmed. Although in general, the presence of severe adjacent edema is considered more compatible with aggressive meningiomas, in some histologically benign types such as secretory type, edema can be disproportionately larger than the small tumor size.The underlying mechanism is most likely multifactorial however it has been shown that there is a strong association between the presence and severity of the peritumoral vasogenic edema (i.e. edema index) and expression of the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) or expression of CEA and CK 17,25.List of some of the proposed underlying mechanisms are: venous stasis/occlusion/thrombosis compressive ischemia aggressive growth/invasion parasitization of pial vessels histologic subtype: secretory meningioma 25  vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF): produced within the meningioma that enters the adjacent parenchyma expression of CEA and CK Angiography (DSA)Catheter angiography is rarely now of diagnostic use but rather is performed for preoperative embolization to reduce intraoperative blood loss and alleviate resection of a tumor. This is especially useful for skull base tumors, or those thought to be particularly vascular (e.g. microcystic variants or those with very large vessels). Particles are favored typically 7-9 days prior to surgery although there are not free of complication particularly one study showed a high prevalence of complications associated with particles smaller than 45–150 μm, so risks and benefits should be thoroughly assessed 26.Meningiomas can have a dual blood supply. The majority of tumors are predominantly supplied by meningeal vessels; these are responsible for the sunburst or spoke-wheel pattern observed on MRI/DSA. Some tumors also have a significant pial supply to the periphery of a tumor.A well known angiographic sign of meningiomas is the mother-in-law sign, in which the tumor contrast blush "comes early, stays late, and is very dense".Treatment and prognosisTreatment is usually with surgical excision. If only incomplete resection is possible (especially at the base of the skull) then external-beam radiation therapy can be used 8.The Simpson grade correlates the degree of surgical resection completeness with symptomatic recurrence.Recurrence rate varies with grade and length of follow-up 8,21 grade I = 7-25% grade II = 29-52% grade III = 50-94% Metastatic disease is rare but has been reported 8.History and etymologyThe term "meningioma" was first introduced by Harvey Cushing, a renowned American neurosurgeon, in 1922 9,23.Differential diagnosisThe differential diagnosis generally includes other dural masses as well as some location-specific entities.The main dural masses to consider include:  hemangiopericytoma more aggressive often destroying bone extensive peripheral vascularity more microlobulation    dural metastases (e.g. breast cancer) for other less common differentials see dural masses  Specific location differentials include:  cerebellopontine angleacoustic schwannoma   pituitary region pituitary macroadenoma craniopharyngioma   base of the skull hypertrophic pachymeningitis extramedullary hematopoiesis chondrosarcoma chordoma   In the setting of hyperostosis consider: Paget's disease fibrous dysplasia sclerotic metastases (e.g. prostate and breast carcinoma)

__label__Central __label__Nervous __label__System Meningothelial hyperplasia is a poorly defined and likely reactive process characterized by a non-invasive, multicentric proliferation of meningothelial arachnoid cap cells. It is one of the causes of pachymeningeal dural thickening. It is not thought of as a neoplastic process or even a precursor to the development of meningiomas, although some cases are difficult to distinguish from meningioma1,5. On this page:  Article: Clinical presentation Pathology Treatment and prognosis  References   Images:Cases and figures  Clinical presentationIn most instances there are no symptoms directly associated with meningothelial hyperplasia, but rather, patients will exhibit symptoms of whatever underlying process is at play. It has been associated with advanced age, chronical renal failure 3, trauma, hemorrhage, intracranial hypotension, and neoplasia. Generally, there is an increased incidence in older age 1. PathologyMeningothelial hyperplasia is common in autopsy series and consists of multiple foci of meningothelial proliferation. It has been variously defined, with obvious implications for reported prevalence. In one publication, for example, a conservative definition of meningothelial proliferation that reaches a thickness of 10 or more cell layers 1. Other publications have defined it as consisting of three or more cell layers 1. There is an occasional psammoma body present. No mitotic activity is seen within these clusters of layer proliferations which are closely associated with dilated vascular channels. There is no evidence of compression of the channels. Although a few perivascular inflammatory cells are present, these are predominantly T lymphocytes with occasional B cells and plasma cells. In contrast to classic meningiomas, and supporting the theory that it is reactive rather than neoplastic, there is no evidence of either NF2 or 4.1B gene deletions on FISH (fluorescence in situ hybridization) or Merlin tumor suppressor activity or loss of protein 4.1B expression on immunohistochemistry 1,2.The histological feature that helps distinguish this entity from normal arachnoidal 'cap' cells is the high frequency of PR positivity, which is not seen in normal cells 1.Treatment and prognosis According to the literature review of the few published articles on this topic, the etiology of meningothelial hyperplasia remains idiopathic, with uncertain pathophysiologic triggers and therefore, no definitive treatment.
__label__Central __label__Nervous __label__System Meningothelial meningiomas (also known as syncytial or endothelial meningiomas) are the most common histological subtype of meningioma, found in ~60% of all meningiomas, most frequently combined with fibrous meningioma (40%) or in isolation (17%) 1. Their epidemiology, clinical presentation, radiographic features, treatment, prognosis, and differential diagnosis are therefore discussed in the main article (see meningioma) and are not repeated here. PathologyMeningothelial meningiomas most closely resemble arachnoid cap cells and are characterized by sheets, whorls or syncytia of neoplastic cells which have round or oval centrally located nuclei with dispersed chromatin, smooth nuclear profiles and small indistinct nucleoli. They also sometimes demonstrate eosinophilic cytoplasmic invaginations (a.k.a. intranuclear pseudoinclusions) 2-3. Lobules of the tumor are separated from each other with collagen sheets 3.

__label__Musculoskeletal Meniscal contusion refers to a form of meniscal injury where there is no overt tear or gross disruption. They usually occur from flexion injuries with compression of the posterior horn of the medial meniscus between the femoral condyle and the tibia.Radiographic featuresMRIIn the setting of trauma, they may be seen as areas of high T2 signal with features of edema. Often there is diffuse intrameniscal hyperintensity, which may mimic a fissure. Concomitant subchondral bone contusion may distinguish meniscal contusions from true fissures 2.
__label__Musculoskeletal Meniscal cysts occur when synovial fluid becomes encysted, often secondary to a meniscal tear. When they extend beyond the margins of the meniscus they are termed parameniscal cysts. On this page:  Article: Epidemiology Clinical presentation Pathology Radiographic features Treatment and prognosis Differential diagnosis Related articles References   Images:Cases and figures  EpidemiologyThe frequency of these cysts is also a matter of controversy. In general, they are thought to present in ~5% of knee MR studies 4.Clinical presentationClinically the patient with meniscal cysts may present with a palpable soft tissue swelling, with or without knee pain.PathologyThere are multiple theories regarding the etiology of meniscal cysts.Surgical and arthroscopic series report lateral meniscal cysts as a more frequent occurrence as compared to their medial counterparts. A systematic review of MR literature says that the frequency of medial and lateral meniscal cysts is almost equal 1. In ~4% of cases, meniscal cysts may involve both menisci within the same knee 5.Associations  discoid meniscus 11  while meniscal tears are associated with the vast majority of cysts, anteriorly located lateral parameniscal cysts are less likely to have underlying meniscal tears 9  some authors suggest a critical size of a meniscal tear at 12 mm along the circumferential axis as identified on MRI as a threshold value for parameniscal cyst formation 10  Radiographic featuresThe cysts of the medial meniscus are usually located along the posterior aspect of the posterior horn, whereas those of the lateral meniscus are located along the anterior/anterolateral aspect of the anterior horn or the body.Plain radiographPlain radiographs may show soft tissue swelling at the expected locations.UltrasoundHigh-resolution musculoskeletal ultrasound can be highly sensitive and usually shows an anechoic or, more commonly, a hypoechoic lesion, in keeping with the cystic nature of the lesion. It may also demonstrate the associated meniscal tear.MRIMRI is the investigation of choice for comprehensive imaging of the knee. Many of the cysts are non-palpable and these patients present with knee pain hence MRI can demonstrate the meniscal tear as well as the cyst.Intracystic signal characteristics include:  T2: high signal (but often not as high as synovial fluid 4)  T1 C+ (Gd): no enhancement MRI may be more sensitive than arthroscopy in detecting cysts since arthroscopic evaluation of the posterior region of the knee joint (posterior to the posterior meniscal horn) is limited. For a definite diagnosis of meniscal/parameniscal cysts, one should confirm not only the presence of the cyst but also meniscal tear and communication between them; otherwise, it should be reported as a possible meniscal cyst.Treatment and prognosisSurgical excision of the cyst can be performed along with repair of the underlying meniscal tear.Based on imaging findings treatment of a cyst differs: if a communicating meniscal tear present, it can be treated arthroscopically if a noncommunicating meniscal tear present, open surgery is required  ComplicationsLongstanding large cysts may cause erosions or scalloping of the adjacent bone.Differential diagnosisAs a broad differential, consider other cyst-like lesions around the knee.

They were initially thought to be only an arthroscopic finding, as a result of joint distension and anesthetic muscle relaxants but they are occasionally seen on MRI.  On this page:  Article: Epidemiology Pathology Radiographic features History and etymology Differential diagnosis Related articles References   Images:Cases and figures  EpidemiologyMeniscal flounces are uncommon with initial studies suggesting a frequency of around 0.2% on MRI scans, however more recently a frequency of up to 5% in relation to the medial meniscus has been reported.1,4 It is far more common to be seen with the medial meniscus than the lateral meniscus.PathologyThey are not associated with an increased incidence of meniscal tears, but can be mistaken for one. They reflect a degree of redundancy in the medial meniscus and are typically seen in the flexed knee. Radiographic featuresMRIIn the sagittal plane the flounce is seen as a wave or kink in the inner margin of the meniscus. In the coronal plane, they may make the inner margin of the meniscus appear truncated or blurred and simulate a small radial tear.Whenever a flounce is identified it is important to check that there are no ligamentous or capsular injuries that may be resulting in the laxity. This is particularly important if a lateral meniscal flounce is seen, as these are rare and may be a sign of popliteomeniscal fascicle injury/deficiency with hypermobile meniscus. History and etymologyOut of interest, a flounce is a ruffle placed around a garment (often undergarment) as a decoration.Differential diagnosisradial-type meniscal tear 
__label__Musculoskeletal Meniscal fraying is a term given to an irregular edge of the meniscus (often of the thinner inner edge) without discrete tearing.Radiographic featuresMRIThe free edge may demonstrate loss of its sharp tapered central edge, and the posterior root ligaments may show subtle, ill-defined, horizontally oriented increased intrameniscal signal intensity contacting the articular surface 1.
__label__Musculoskeletal Meniscal maceration is a finding sometimes used on MRI imaging to describe wasting away of the meniscus or cause to become soft or separated into constituent elements. It is often used with chronic degenerative conditions although some authors also propose this term in the setting of a tear (macerated tear) 2. On imaging, it is often seen as meniscal loss with destruction of expected architecture.

__label__Musculoskeletal Meniscal tears are the failure of the fibrocartilaginous menisci of the knee. There are several types and can occur in an acute or chronic setting. Meniscal tears are best evaluated with MRI. On this page:  Article: Pathology Radiographic features Treatment and prognosis Pitfalls Differential diagnosis   Related articles References   Images:Cases and figures  PathologyAcute meniscal tears occur after the rotatory trauma of the knee, whereas chronic degenerative meniscal tears often occur in the elderly after minimal rotatory trauma or stress on the knee. In older adults, attritional changes in the meniscus lead to fragmentation of the meniscus and a variety of tears (usually occur at the posterior horn of the medial meniscus) 8. TypesThere are different types of meniscal tears, describing the morphology of the injury. Identifying and accurately describing the type of meniscal tear can help the surgeon in patient education and planning of the surgical procedure. Meniscal tear types include 1,5,6: basic tears longitudinally oriented tears  horizontal tear (cleavage tear) parallel to the tibial plateau involving one of the articular surfaces or free edge divides the meniscus into superior and inferior parts    longitudinal tear (vertical tear) perpendicular to the tibial plateau and parallel to the long axis of the meniscus divides the meniscus into medial and lateral parts  Wrisberg rip - is a specific subtype  ramp lesion - is a specific subtype      radial tear: perpendicular to both the tibial plateau and the long axis of the meniscus  root tear: typically radial-type tear located at the meniscal root     complex tear: a combination of all or some of horizontal, longitudinal and radial-type tears displaced tear: tear involving a component that is displaced, either still attached to the parent meniscus or detached:  flap tear: displaced horizontal or longitudinal tears  bucket-handle tear: displaced longitudinal tear   parrot beak tear: oblique radial tear   Radiographic featuresPlain radiographOn plain radiographs, meniscal tears are not visible. In rare cases secondary signs can be seen, such as a soft tissue swelling next to the meniscus when a meniscal cyst is present 4. Only when associated with more complex injuries plain film may suggest a meniscal tear, e.g. arcuate sign, reverse Segond fracture, tibial plateau fracture. MRIWith a sensitivity of ~95% and a specificity of 81% for medial meniscal tears and sensitivity of ~85% and a specificity of 93% for lateral meniscal tears 2,5, MRI is the modality of choice when a meniscal tear is suspected, with sagittal images being the most sensitive 5.There are three basic MR characteristics/criteria of meniscal tears 5: high intrameniscal signal extending to at least one articular surface, which should be seen in at least two slices: two slice touch rule (do not have to be contiguous, e.g. sagittal and coronal slices) distortion of the normal meniscal morphology if no prior surgery Each type of meniscal tear has its own characteristics on MRI, but in most cases, the following can be seen 3:  T1: a hyperintense line in the meniscus can be seen, but it is difficult to differentiate between degeneration and meniscal tear on this sequence; in the case of a bucket-handle tear an empty groove can sometimes be seen  T2: a hyperintense line in the meniscus, which indicates synovial fluid in the meniscusthe high T2 signal in mid-substance of the meniscus without extension to the surface is not necessarily a tear and can be: in adults: secondary to degeneration  in children: high vascularity of meniscus    See MRI grading system for meniscal signal intensity.Associated features that are suggestive of a meniscal tear include 5: tibial subchondral bone edema  parameniscal cyst meniscal extrusion Treatment and prognosisSurgical arthroscopy is done in most of the cases.

On this page:  Article: Epidemiology Clinical presentation Pathology Radiographic features Treatment and prognosis Complication Differential diagnosis References   Images:Cases and figures  EpidemiologyMesenteric adenitis is most common in children and adolescents although it may occasionally affect adults. Clinical presentationPresentation is similar (or can be identical) to acute appendicitis, hence is a differential diagnosis for right iliac fossa (RIF) pain. PathologyThe pathogenic micro-organisms are thought to gain access via intestinal lymphatics and then multiply in mesenteric lymph nodes. On gross pathology, lymph nodes are enlarged and soft. On microscopy, there is non-specific hyperplasia and when suppurative, there is necrosis and pus.Mesenteric adenitis has a number of causes: variety of viruses Yersinia enterocolitica Helicobacter jejuni Campylobacter jejuni Salmonella spp. Shigella spp. Mycobacterium tuberculosis 8 Yersinia enterocolitica is considered the most common pathogen in temperate Europe, North America and Australia. It is more common in boys.Occasionally in young children and infants, ileocolitis may be also present suggesting that the lymph node involvement may be secondary to a primary enteric pathogen.Radiographic featuresAs mesenteric adenitis usually presents in the young, ultrasound is often the investigation of choice. CT is usually reserved for older patients if needed at all. Features on either modality include:  enlarged lymph nodes3 or more (very) tender nodes with a short-axis diameter of at least 5 mm clustered in the right lower quadrant (see normal mesenteric lymph nodes) 1,2​​enlarged lymph nodes are located anterior to the right psoas in the majority of cases, or in the small bowel mesentery 6.   ileal or ileocecal wall thickening may be presentthicker than 3 mm over at least 5 cm of the bowel despite bowel lumen opacification (CT) and distention  a normal appendix (if seen) Treatment and prognosisIn most cases, mesenteric adenitis is self-limiting and typically abates over the course of a few weeks. Interestingly, when mesenteric adenitis (or appendicitis) occurs in childhood or adolescence, there is a significantly reduced risk of ulcerative colitis later in life 3.ComplicationOccasionally, enlarged mesenteric lymph nodes may result in vascular compromise leading to ischemic colitis 9.Differential diagnosisThe clinical differential includes:  acute appendicitis generally smaller and fewer lymph nodes abnormal appendix   intussusception Meckel diverticulitis

Severe abdominal pain that is disproportionate to examination findings and that responds poorly to analgesia is a classic mode of presentation for acute mesenteric ischemia. PathologyBowel ischemia severity ranges from mild (generally transient superficial changes of intestinal mucosa) to more dangerous and potentially life-threatening transmural bowel wall necrosis 1. If ischemia is severe enough and is not relieved quickly, then a predictable sequence of events will usually be observed: necrosis of the bowel wall bacteria proliferation in the bowel wall, releasing gas in the wall itself (pneumatosis intestinalis) gas goes through mesenteric vessels into the portal vein (pneumatosis portalis) sepsis and/or intestinal perforation death EtiologyMesenteric ischemia can be classified into broad groups according to etiology 13: acute mesenteric ischemia (95% cases)  arterial occlusive mesenteric ischemia (60-85% cases)  non-occlusive mesenteric ischemia (15-30% cases)  veno-occlusive mesenteric ischemia (5-15% cases) mixed, e.g. strangulating bowel obstruction     chronic mesenteric ischemia (5%) LocationSometimes it may be useful to think of mesenteric ischemia in the setting of location: small bowel ischemia  large bowel ischemia (ischemic colitis) Radiographic featuresAlthough historically catheter angiography was the gold standard for imaging of suspected intestinal ischemia, CT has replaced it, with its ability to volumetrically assess the whole abdomen in multiple vascular phases, e.g. arterial, portal venous, delayed. It also has the added advantage of being able to diagnose alternative causes of acute abdominal pain. As such CT is now the investigation of choice for patients with suspected intestinal ischemia.CTTechniqueIn general CT of the abdomen and pelvis should be performed with intravenous contrast and a neutral luminal contrast (e.g. water) so that bowel wall enhancement and thickness can be adequately assessed 7. Ideally, positive oral contrast is best avoided to better delineate wall enhancement. Administration of positive rectal contrast may help define colonic wall thickening but is more useful when it is the distal colon which is affected (inferior mesenteric artery) - see ischemic colitis.Multiple contrast phases are typically obtained: non-contrast (some studies demonstrate that this phase is not necessary for the diagnosis of acute mesenteric ischemia 10) arterial phase (e.g. triggered when abdominal aorta reaches >100 HU) portal venous phase, e.g. 30 seconds after arterial phase finishes FindingsImaging features can vary depending on the time course and etiology and are therefore discussed separately in the articles above. A number of features are however common to most advanced acute cases and result from the bowel wall necrosis and perforation:  pneumatosis intestinalis: gas in intestinal wall  pneumatosis portalis: gas in the portal vein or in mesenteric veincan be differentiated by pneumobilia because gas usually reaches the periphery of the liver while pneumobilia is usually about 2 cm short of external liver border, and is more clustered at the hilum   pneumoperitoneum: perforation of the bowel submucosal hemorrhage: sensitivity for diagnosis is low (10%) with all true-positive cases having other CT findings present at diagnosis 10  variable amounts of free fluid It is important to note that bowel wall thickness is not increased in all causes, and can in fact be thinned in complete arterial occlusion or bowel obstruction 7.Dual-energy CTThe addition of iodine maps and 40-keV monoenergetic images to standard single energy CT images was found to increase reader confidence and accuracy in diagnosing acute bowel ischemia. Ischemic segments have been found to have lower densities and iodine concentrations compared to non-ischemic segments 12.Treatment and prognosisAlthough treatment will vary according to the severity and cause of the ischemia, in general treatment is surgical. The bowel needs to be assessed for viability and if necrotic needs to be resected. In some instances, endovascular thrombolysis/thrombectomy may be beneficial 8. Mortality rate is high at ~60% (range 30-90%) 13.
__label__Gastrointestinal A mesentery is a double layer of peritoneum that encloses the intestines and attaches them to the posterior abdominal wall. The term was originally only used to refer to the double layer of peritoneum that suspends the jejunum and ileum, but its meaning has been widened.Mesenteries include:  small bowel mesentery (mesentery proper): suspends the jejunum and the ileum  mesoappendix: peritoneum of the vermiform appendix  transverse mesocolon: peritoneum of the transverse colon  sigmoid mesocolon: peritoneum of the sigmoid colon 
__label__Central __label__Nervous __label__System The mesial temporal lobe, also known as the medial temporal lobe, is, as the name suggests, located on the medial aspect of the temporal lobe and is distinct from the rest of the lobe, which is composed of neocortex. The term comprises five structures:  amygdala hippocampus uncus dentate gyrus parahippocampal gyrus 
__label__Central __label__Nervous __label__System Mesial temporal sclerosis (MTS), also commonly referred to as hippocampal sclerosis, is the most common association with intractable temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) 2,3,5. It is seen in up to 65% of autopsy studies, although significantly less on imaging. On this page:  Article: Clinical presentation Pathology Radiographic features Treatment and prognosis References   Images: Cases and figures Imaging differential diagnosis   Clinical presentationMost patients present with complex partial temporal lobe epilepsy.Febrile seizuresThe relationship, if any, of mesial temporal sclerosis with febrile seizures is controversial, made all the more difficult due to the relative insensitivity of imaging and the difficulty in establishing whether a particular seizure was truly febrile. Up to a third of patients with established refractory temporal lobe epilepsy have a history of seizures in childhood at the time of fever 3. Follow up of children with febrile seizures does not demonstrate significant increased incidence of temporal lobe epilepsy 3.PathologyThe hippocampal formation is not uniformly affected, with the dentate gyrus, and the CA1, CA4 and to a lesser degree CA3 sections of the hippocampus being primarily involved 4. Histologically there is neuronal cell loss, gliosis and sclerosis.EtiologyControversy exists as to the causative mechanism: is mesial temporal sclerosis a result of temporal lobe epilepsy or vice versa 5? In children with newly diagnosed epilepsy, only ~ 1% have evidence of MTS on imaging 3. Furthermore, in adults 3-10% of cases of mesial temporal sclerosis demonstrate bilateral changes 5 even though symptoms may be unilateral.Radiographic featuresMRIMRI is the modality of choice to evaluate the hippocampus, however dedicated TLE protocol needs to be performed if good sensitivity and specificity is to be achieved 5. Thin section angled coronal sequences at right angles to the longitudinal axis of the hippocampus are required, to minimize volume averaging.Coronal volume and coronal high resolution T2WI/FLAIR are best to diagnose MTS.Findings include 4: reduced hippocampal volume: hippocampal atrophy increased T2 signal abnormal morphology: loss of internal architecture (interdigitations of hippocampus), stratum radiata, a thin layer of white matter separates the dentate nucleus and Ammon horn Although comparing left to right side is easiest, it must be remembered that up to 10% of cases are bilateral, and thus if symmetry is the only feature being evaluated, many cases may be misinterpreted as normal.Often mentioned, but probably one of the least specific findings, is enlargement of the temporal horn of the lateral ventricle 5. If anything, care must be taken not to allow an enlarged horn to trick you into thinking the hippocampus is reduced in size.When severe and long standing, additional associated findings include 4: atrophy of the ipsilateral fornix and mammillary body  increased signal and or atrophy of the anterior thalamic nucleus atrophy of the cingulate gyrus  increased signal and/or reduction in the volume of the amygdala  reduction in the volume of the subiculum  dilatation of temporal horn and temporal lobe atrophy collateral white matter and entorhinal cortex atrophy thalamic and caudate atrophy ipsilateral cerebral hypertrophy contralateral cerebellar hemiatrophy loss of grey-white matter interface in the anterior temporal lobe 5  reduced white matter volume in the parahippocampal gyrus 5  Additional 3D volumetric studies can be performed, and although time consuming to post-process may be more sensitive to subtle hippocampal volume loss. Gadolinium is not required 5.T2 relaxometry may also be useful in detecting cases of hippocampal sclerosis 5.Diffusion MRIAs a result of neuronal loss, the extracellular space is enlarged and thus diffusion of water molecules is greater on the affected side, resulting in increased values on the affected side (higher signal on ADC).Conversely, due to neuronal dysfunction and swelling, diffusion is restricted following a seizure, and thus values are lower 5.MR spectroscopyMR spectroscopy findings typically represent neuronal dysfunction 5: decreased NAA and decreased NAA/Cho and NAA/Cr ratios decreased MI in ipsilateral temporal lobe increased lipid  and lactate soon after as seizure MR perfusionMR perfusion demonstrates similar changes to SPECT (see below) with blood perfusion depending on when the scan is obtained.During the peri-ictal phases, perfusion is increased, not only in the mesial temporal lobe but often in large parts of temporal lobe and hemisphere. In interictal periods, conversely, perfusion is reduced 5.Nuclear medicineSPECT (Tc-99m HMPAO or ECD)9 and PET (F18-FDG) imaging are also a useful adjuncts, with both ictal and interictal scans demonstrating abnormalities:  ictal scan: hyperperfusion  interictal scan: hypoperfusion Other causes of temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) should be considered, especially as small temporal lobe cortical tumors can have similar appearances.Treatment and prognosisTLE is initially managed medically with anti-epileptic agents. In patients who are refractory to medical management temporal lobectomy or selective amygdalohippocampectomy may be performed. Anterior temporal lobectomy is successful in 75-90% of patients with MTS.

__label__Gastrointestinal The mesoappendix is a fold of peritoneum around the vermiform appendix and one of the four mesenteries in the abdominal cavity.It is attached to the lower end of the small bowel mesentery, close to the ileocecal junction. It usually extends to the tip of the appendix and sometimes suspends the cecum. It contains the appendicular artery and vein in its free wall. 
__label__Obstetrics __label__Urogenital Mesoblastic nephroma, also sometimes known as a congenital mesoblastic nephroma (CMN) or fetal renal hamartoma, is, in general, a benign renal tumor that typically occurs in utero or in infancy. On this page:  Article: Epidemiology Clinical presentation Pathology Radiographic features Treatment and prognosis Differential diagnosis  See also References   Images:Cases and figures  EpidemiologyIt is the commonest neonatal renal tumor. Diagnosis is usually made in the antenatal period or immediately after birth. The tumor accounts for approximately 3-6% of all renal neoplasms in children 3,7. Approximately 50% occur during the neonatal period and most of the cases are diagnosed within the first 3 months of life 11. Overall, 90% of the cases are discovered by the age of 1 year 11.Clinical presentationMost common clinical presentation is a palpable abdominal mass, with hematuria occurring less frequently.PathologyIt is a mesenchymal tumor. Macroscopically the tumor is a solid un-encapsulated mass which often occurs near the renal hilum. It tends to invade the surrounding structures and renal parenchyma. Hemorrhage and necrosis are infrequent. Histologically, it is typically composed of connective tissue growing between nephrons, usually replacing most of the renal parenchyma.The classic cytological description of the lesion is that of cellular clusters of spindle cells, mild nuclear pleomorphism, mitotic activity and no blastema.SubtypesThere are two main pathological variants:  classic mesoblastic nephroma: accounts for less than one third of cases of CMN 11   cellular mesoblastic nephroma  more heterogeneous in appearance on imaging tends to be larger and presents later in infancy (> 3 months of life 11) may exhibit aggressive behavior including vascular encasement and metastasis 5    Associations polyhydramnios fetal hypercalcemia Radiographic featuresPlain radiographNon specific and not an imaging modality of choice but if performed incidentally in a neonate, may demonstrate a soft tissue mass displacing bowel. Calcification is rare 3.UltrasoundSonographic appearance can vary depending on the pathological variant 6. In general it is a well-defined mass with low-level homogeneous echoes. The presence of concentric echogenic and hypoechoic rings can be a helpful diagnostic feature in the classic subtype, but may also be seen in the cellular subtype 11. A more complex pattern due to hemorrhage, cyst formation and necrosis can also be seen and tends to favor the cellular variant. Color Doppler interrogation may show increased vascularity. Uncommonly the tumor may appear predominantly cystic 11. Antenatal ultrasound may also show evidence of associated polyhydramnios.CTUsually not performed in an antenatal situation. Solid hypoattenuating renal lesion with variable contrast enhancement. Cystic areas, necrosis, and hemorrhage are uncommon (only in cellular type) 5. Typically no calcification seen. Hyperdense foci, however, may be seen related to hemorrhage in the cellular subtype 13. MRIBest modality for cross sectional imaging antenatally and can better assess anatomical relationships.  Unless complicated necrosis and hemorrhage (both generally uncommon), general signal characteristics within the mass include:  T1: iso to hypointense 8, may show hyperintense foci related to hemorrhage in the cellular subtype 13   T2: variable, from markedly hypointense to hyperintense 11   DWI: shows restricted diffusion in the solid portion of the tumor, likely related to increase cellularity 12  Treatment and prognosisThe majority are benign tumors and have a favourable outcome. The cellular variant can, at times, be aggressive. As a surgical option, a nephrectomy usually suffices. ComplicationsPotential complications with large tumors include:  abdominal dystocia at birth arterio-venous shunting with subsequent development of hydrops fetalis  Differential diagnosis  Wilms tumor renal clear cell sarcoma rhabdoid tumor See also pediatric renal tumors and masses fetal tumors

This is a slightly confusing entitiy since some authors have used this term as synonymous with clear cell carcinoma of the cervix 6. On this page:  Article: Epidemiology  Pathology See also References   Epidemiology They are thought to represent approximately 3% of cervical adenocarcinomas 5. Only a handful of publications are found on this entity with no radiology publications on this entity at the time of writing (2012).PathologyThey are considered to arise from remnants of the mesonephric (Wolffian) ducts, specifically the Gartner’s duct. These duct remnants are usually located in the muscular wall of the cervix, meaning that mesonephric adenocarcinoma is more likely to localizes to within the cervix wall than other types of adenocarcinoma 5. They usually have relatively low grade morphology, in part recapitualing the duct structures they are thought to arise from; they are composed of small, compact ducts/gland structures, lined by variably (but usually mildly) atypical, cuboidal to columnar epithelium, with ducts containing dense eosinophilic secretions. Mesonephric adenocarcinoma is usually EMA+, calretinin+, vimentin+, CD10+, and ER/PR hormone receptor -ve7AssociationsThis is one of the few sub types that are not associated with prior HPV infection 4.See alsoWHO histological classification of tumors of the uterine cervix

__label__Chest __label__Oncology Mesothelioma, also known as malignant mesothelioma, is an aggressive malignant tumor of the mesothelium. Most tumors arise from the pleura, and so this article will focus on pleural mesothelioma.Given the presence of the mesothelium in different parts of the body, mesothelioma can arise in various locations 17:  pleural mesothelioma (~90%) - covered on this article  peritoneal mesothelioma (~10%)  pericardial mesothelioma (<1%) cystic/multicystic mesothelioma  tunica vaginalis testis mesothelioma (<1%)  On this page:  Article: Epidemiology Clinical presentation Pathology Radiographic features Treatment and prognosis Differential diagnosis Practical points References   Images: Cases and figures Imaging differential diagnosis   EpidemiologyMesothelioma is an uncommon entity and accounts for 5-28% of all malignancies that involve the pleura 1,7. There is a strong association with exposure to asbestos fibers (~10% risk during lifetime; 40-80% of patients have a history of asbestos exposure). Unlike other asbestos-related lung diseases, it does not appear to be dose-dependent 1.Not all types of asbestos are strongly implicated, with crocidolite being the main causative fiber type. Not surprisingly, given the sources of asbestos exposure being predominantly mining, construction, lagging and machinery mechanics, 60-80% of cases are encountered in males, in general, 20 to 35 years after exposure 1,5,6. Some areas of the world have very regional hotspots, such as Belfast in Northern Ireland, due to the historic shipbuilding industry.There is also increased risk for those with household exposure (e.g. family of exposed workers) 14.There has been no convincing evidence for an association with smoking 6.Clinical presentationTypically patients present with dyspnea and low back non-pleuritic chest pain. Pleural effusions are seen in the vast majority of patients at some stage during their disease. Up to 25% of patients have metastatic disease at the time of presentation if staged with FDG PET 5.Typically mesothelioma is thought of as a locally-aggressive disease, however distant extranodal metastases are seen 15, albeit uncommonly. In a postmortem study of 318 patients, 55% patients were found to have extrathoracic metastases, the commonest sites being the liver (32%), spleen (11%), thyroid (7%) and brain (3%) 16. Of course prevalence of metastases on imaging is likely to be lower than on postmortem studies.PathologyEtiology  asbestos-fiber exposure: causes majority of cases erionite-fiber exposure: naturally occurring mineral used in building, particularly in Turkey 12  simian virus 40 (SV40) 13  radiation exposure 13  HistologyThere are three histological types of mesothelioma: epithelial: ~60% mixed: 25% sarcomatoid: 15% The cytological and histological diagnosis can be difficult, with mesothelial hyperplasia and metastatic adenocarcinoma appearing similar. Specific markers are helpful including: calretinin epithelial membrane antigen cytokeratin mesothelin (elevated in 84% of malignant mesothelioma versus <2% with other pleural diseases 6) Subtypes such as multicystic/cystic mesothelioma are rarer and less aggressive.Radiographic featuresSee staging of malignant pleural mesothelioma.Plain radiographChest radiographs are non-specific and of limited utility 6. The following features may be evident: pleural opacity which may extend around and encase the lung reduced volume of the affected hemithorax, resulting in ipsilateral shift of the mediastinum (common) 4   rib destruction or extension beyond the lateral and anterior margins of the chest wall +/- mediastinal lymphadenopathy +/- pleural effusion; most commonly is unilateral and exudative or hemorrhagic in nature, with frozen hemithorax (not causing mediastinal shift) CTCT is most commonly used for imaging assessment of mesothelioma, and sufficient for accurate staging of disease in most patients. pleural mass or nodular thickening of soft tissue attenuationtends to cause "inward" contraction of the hemithorax, e.g. ipsilateral mediastinal shift  pattern of spread pattern of spread initially to adjacent pleura involvement pleural fissures eventually grows toward lung encasement ("pleural rind')   predilection for local invasion involvement of chest wall, diaphragm, and mediastinal content typical 1,2,4  chest wall involvement infiltration of the extra-pleural fat plane 4  obvious direct extension in bone or muscle 4  known to invade along prior catheter and biopsy tracks 18    pericardial effusion may suggest transpericardial extension 3,4    frequent metastasis to local lymph nodes and contralateral lung   calcification seen in 20% - usually represents engulfment of calcified pleural plaques rather than true tumor calcification 4  sarcomatoid variants may contain calcific osteosarcoma or chondrosarcomatous components   An uncommon variant is the solitary mediastinal malignant mesothelioma which has appearances reminiscent of a solitary fibrous tumor of the pleura 1.MRIMRI, although not routinely used, may have a role in refining the staging and better delineating the extent of the disease in surgical candidates especially concerning the chest wall and diaphragmatic invasion 4.

Single modality treatment (surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, immunotherapy and even photodynamic therapy) have not been shown to improve survival 3. More recently multi-modality treatment has had some impact on favourable subgroups (early disease, and epithelioid histology). Treatment includes: extrapleural pneumonectomy adjuvant chemotherapy radiotherapy The prognosis is poor for all tumor types with a median overall survival without treatment of 4-12 months 3. In favourable patient subgroups up to 45% 5-year survival may be achievable 3, however even with aggressive multi-modality therapy overall 5-year survival remains poor (3-18%) 3 with a median survival time of approximately 18 months 4.Differential diagnosisThe differential is dependent on the exact nature of tumor involvement and the modality. General imaging differential considerations include  pleural effusion (especially if loculated): on radiographs  pleural metastases (especially with pleural carcinomatosis) peripheral bronchogenic carcinoma  solitary fibrous tumor of pleura other pleural based tumors   tumor like conditions of the pleura benign asbestos-related pleural disease  pleural fibrosis from infective/inflammatory source (e.g. actinomycetes, tuberculosis)   Practical pointsavoid the temptation of performing an image-guided biopsy, as mesothelioma is notorious for aggressively seeding along the biopsy track

__label__Musculoskeletal The metacarpal index (MCI) is a radiographic measurement that can be used to confirm the presence of disproportionate metacarpal length. It was first introduced by Sinclair in 1960 for the diagnosis of Marfan syndrome 6. The metacarpal index is no longer used for the diagnosis of Marfan syndrome due to its low sensitivity and specificity.Radiographic assessmentAt least two methods exist for the calculation of the metacarpal index. These two methods are not mathematically identical, and a statistically significant difference has been noted between them. The first method of MCI calculation is by obtaining the average of the ratios of length / width of metacarpals 2-5.The second method involves dividing the sum of the lengths by the sum of the widths of these metacarpals.Values of between 8.4 and 9.4 have been used as cut-off for abnormal values.

It arises from a deficiency of the enzyme arylsulfatase A as a result of a mutation in the arylsulfatase A (ARSA) gene located on chromosome 22q13. This results in the accumulation of 3-O-sulfogalactosylceramide (sulfatide) in various organs including the central nervous system (Schwann cells, oligodendrocytes, and some neurons) impairing myelination and function 8.  Metachromatic refers to the histologic staining characteristic caused by abnormal accumulations of sulfatides in white matter 6.Markersserum/urine arylsulfatase A levels: reducedRadiographic featuresMRICharacterized by bilateral symmetrical confluent areas of periventricular deep white matter signal change, in particular around the atria and frontal horns with sparing of subcortical U fibers leading to a "butterfly pattern". Progression can lead to cortical and subcortical atrophy 8.Signal characteristics  T1: affected areas are low signal  T1 C+ (Gd) no enhancement is characteristic however, some cases may show a linear punctate enhancement pattern within lesions 2  multiple cranial nerve enhancement has been reported 7     T2: affected areas are high signal and may show a "tigroid pattern" on axial plane or "leopard pattern" on sagittal plane representing sparing along the venules  subcortical U-fibers are usually spared 8     MR spectroscopy: (of affected white matter) reduced N-acetyl aspartate (NAA) increased myoinositol increased lactate   Differential diagnosisIn addition to many of the other leukodystrophies, a tigroid pattern of involvement may also be seen in: Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease autosomal recessive spastic ataxia of Charlevoix

__label__Musculoskeletal A metal artifact reduction sequence (MARS) is intended to reduce the size and intensity of susceptibility artifacts resulting from magnetic field distortion.A variety of techniques are used for reducing metal artifacts at MRI, both for addressing artifacts due to the presence of metal in the image plane (in-plane artifacts) and for artifacts due to metal in an adjacent plane (through-plane artifacts).In-plane artifact reductionA number of simple changes to the scan protocol can greatly reduce artifacts. Examples are 1: lower magnet strength: 1.5 T rather than 3 T increase bandwidth during slice selection and readout increase matrix: 512 pixel  maintain good signal to noise ratio by increasing number of excitations (NEX)  spin echo instead of gradient echo where possible  STIR for fat suppression (spectral frequency selective fat suppression performs better in a homogeneous field) shorter echo spacing smaller water-fat shift thinner slices view-angle-tilting (VAT) Through-plane artifact reductionMultiacquisition variable-resonance image combination (MAVRIC) is a specialized sequence designed by GE to minimize metallic artifact around metallic prostheses 3. It relies on 3D FSE sequences, using multiple different overlapping volumes at different frequency offsets.Another technique developed by Siemens used for addressing through-plane metal artifacts is Slice-Encoding for Metal Artifact Correction (SEMAC), where an additional slice-encoding gradient is added to a standard fast-spin echo sequence 4. The combination of the MAVRIC and SEMAC technique is known as MAVRIC-SL 5.
__label__Chest Metal fume fever is a (typically) self-limiting disease due to exposure to fumes emanating from working metal, e.g. welding. Polymer fume fever is a related, yet distinct, condition. On this page:  Article: Epidemiology Clinical presentation Pathology Radiographic features Treatment and prognosis History and etymology Differential diagnosis Related pathology References   EpidemiologyDue to gradual improvements in health and safety over the past 100 or so years, a marked decline in recorded cases of metal fume fever has been seen. Nevertheless, up to 2500 cases are still diagnosed in the USA per annum, and in Victoria, Australia, 85 cases were identified in a retrospective study looking at the preceding 5.5 years: 99% cases in adults 96% cases in men Clinical presentation rapid onset of symptoms (5-10 hours) following exposure to the fumes flu-like symptomsfever, rigors, arthralgia, myalgia, headache, malaise  generally, the condition is self-limiting with no long term sequelae rarely severe symptoms may result if exposure to the fumes continues through the working week then rapid tolerance is usual, such that symptoms are much better by Friday. Therefore symptoms tend to maximize in severity on the first return to work after a weekend or any time away from the workplace. diagnosis is usually clinical PathologyExposing metal to very high temperatures, such as occurs in welding, and related processes, results in the emanation of "metal fumes", which are defined as solid submicron-sized particles formed by the condensation of aerosolized metal compounds 1.Zinc oxide is the most commonly implicated metal compound. Although the fumes can contain a wide range of metals including zinc, copper, manganese, chromium, iron, titanium, cadmium and nickel. The relative proportions of the various metals are conditional upon the form of welding employed, the metals being worked, etc. Zinc aside, it is contentious if some or most of these metals actually contribute to the pathogenesis of metal fume fever.The underlying pathogenesis is still being researched but is likely secondary to both immune and non-immune mediated mechanisms. Radiographic featuresChest imaging usually shows clear lung parenchyma and CT may show mild atelectasis or pleural effusions. Much less commonly, bilateral patchy ground-glass opacities, or even consolidations, may be seen, with an appearance mimicking acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).Treatment and prognosisTreatment tends to be supportive and in the vast majority recovery is rapid. No deaths have been recorded.History and etymologyFirst published case is from 1831 1.

__label__Interventional __label__Urogenital Metallic ureteric stents are a type of ureteric stent developed to offer improved symptomatic relief of obstruction when compared to polymeric (polyurethane) stents. They are often used in patients with chronic malignant ureteric obstructions who require placement of long-term ureteral stents to relieve the urinary obstruction and as a palliative measure to reduce pain and avoid major operation.They aim to be better than polymeric (polyurethane) stents by: better maintaining ureteral patency in malignancy when conventional polyurethane stents are usually occluded having increased time intervals between stent changes being less prone to infection and bleeding causing less irritation of the lower urinary tract An example of a metallic ureteric stent is the Memokath stent, which has an expanded top to anchor it within the ureter.History and etymologySomewhat surprisingly the word 'stent' is actually an eponym, originally named after Charles Stent (1807-1885), a largely-forgotten British dentist. He invented an improved material for forming dental impressions, and set up a company to manufacture it. During the Great War, J F Esser, a Dutch surgeon used a mold of Stent's Compound as a fixative for skin grafting in injured infantrymen. This innovative use, was rapidly adopted into practice, and stenting as a concept rapidly segued into multiple specialties 3.See also ureteric stent antegrade ureteric stent percutaneous nephrostomy medical devices in the abdomen

On this page:  Article: Clinical presentation Epidemiology Pathology Radiographic features Differential diagnosis See also References   Images: Cases and figures Imaging differential diagnosis   Clinical presentationMetal-on-metal pseudotumors are large focal solid or semiliquid masses around the hip (or knee) prostheses. The pseudotumors mimic local effects of neoplasia or infection in the absence of either of these. The principal symptom is pain. There may be restricted range of movement with large pseudotumors.EpidemiologyThe incidence of symptomatic pseudotumors following metal-on-metal hip arthroplasty is in the region of 5%.Patients with bilateral resurfacing total hip replacement who develop a pseudotumor in one hip have a 1 in 3 chance of having a lesion on the contralateral side.Pseudotumors are more common in females.PathologyThe pathophysiology is poorly understood. Metal-on-metal pseudotumors are sterile inflammatory lesions.Excessive wear is considered the initiating process, leading to the release of particles (nanometer sized). These are cytotoxic to macrophages once phagocytosed, therefore leading to necrosis within the lesions.Reactive masses are related to high serum and joint fluid ion levels, and a delayed type IV hypersensitivity reaction has been implied.Radiographic featuresUltrasoundSonographic features are non-specific but may show: mass of heterogenous echogenicity  without internal power or color Doppler signal  fluid components MRIMetal artefact reduction sequences (MARS) may be helpful for evaluationPosterolateral lesions located at posterolateral aspect of the joint, often in continuity with the greater trochanter typically cystic in nature frequently with layering of contents, and a low signal intensity wall foci of susceptibility artefact due to metal content  representing extension through posterior capsular defects (typical surgical approach in hip arthroplasty  Anterior lesions  less common typically involving the iliopsoas bursa solid components are more likely typical: contiguous with the joint capsule (representing distension of the iliopsoas bursa) Arthrography may more definitively reveal a connection between the periprosthetic collection and the joint space aspiration of the collection will reveal elevated cobalt and chromium ion levels (may be elevated in serum as well) Signal characteristics T C+ (Gd): and generally show no enhancement 5 Differential diagnosisImaging differential diagnosis in MRIThere are two important diagnostic alternatives.Infection less well defined than pseudotumors lack of a low signal intensity rim Soft-tissue edema can be seen with both infection or pseudotumor.

It is suggestive of non-accidental injury (NAI).  On this page:  Article: Epidemiology Pathology Radiographic features See also Related articles References   Images:Cases and figures  EpidemiologyThis injury is not only the fracture most specific for NAI, it is also common among abused children, occurring in ~50% (range 39-59%). PathologyThe biomechanics of metaphyseal fracture is the cumulation of multiple microfractures across the metaphysis with an orientation perpendicular to the long axis of the bone. To-and-fro manipulation (shaking) is the force applied, for example holding the child around the trunk while shaking, with the limbs moving back and forth with a resultant whiplash or shear force. The microfractures occur in immature mineralized bone.This injury occurs almost exclusively in children under 2 years of age because: they are small enough to be shaken they cannot protect their limbs Although associated with non-accidental injury, in newborns they may be related to traumatic delivery during a breach presentation 4.Radiographic featuresPlain radiographRadiolucent area within the subphyseal metaphysis perpendicular to the long axis of the bone. The fracture extends across the metaphysis (completely or partially).Nuclear medicineLike other fractures, there is an increased uptake of technetium-99m methylene diphosphonate. However, intense uptake of technetium-99m methylene diphosphonate at the metaphyses is normal in young children; abnormally increased uptake may be difficult to identify. Therefore scintigraphy is considered complementary only (as far as metaphyseal corner fractures are concerned).See also non-accidental injury metaphyseal fracture 
__label__Musculoskeletal The metaphyseal-diaphyseal angle (of Drennan) is an important measurement used to distinguish between tibia vara (Blount disease) and physiological bowleg. MeasurementThis angle is measured by drawing a line along the long axis of the tibia, creating a perpendicular to this line, and drawing another line through axial plane of the proximal tibial metaphysis. The angle created between the perpendicular line shown and the metaphyseal line is the metaphyseal diaphyseal angle.InterpretationIt is abnormal if >11o, indicating Blount disease.

The flared metaphyses are relatively lucent.The patients are often asymptomatic although genu valgus deformity may be a feature.Where there is cranial involvement, it is termed craniometaphyseal dysplasia.
__label__Musculoskeletal __label__Trauma Metaphyseal fractures are fractures that involve the metaphysis of tubular bones. They may occur in pediatric or adult patients.Examples of metaphyseal fractures: adults surgical neck of humerus fracture distal radial fracture transtrochanteric fracture   childrendistal radial buckle fracture  Not all metaphyseal fractures intersect the physis. Even if a fracture does extend to the physis, it does not make it a Salter-Harris fracture. Salter-Harris fractures are those which either traverse the physis or extend along the physis.Differential diagnosisIt is also worth making the distinction between a metaphyseal fracture and a metaphyseal corner fracture. Metaphyseal corner fractures are highly suggestive of inflicted non-accidental injury.

There is a mixture of glandular epithelial elements and mesenchymal malignant elements. The spindle cell component in 98% of SpCC is immunoreactive for keratin.GeneticsPhyllodes tumors and sarcomas are usually negative for p63 expression. In metaplastic carcinoma, the sensitivity for p63 is 86.7% and the sensitivity is 99.4%.Radiographic featuresMammographyOn a mammogram, these are usually large lesions, mean diameter at the time of diagnosis is 4.2 cm. The lesions are rounded densities on mammography with margins that are both well defined and smooth and spiculated. Calcification is very rare. UltrasoundOn ultrasound the lesions are round to ovoid, maybe microlobulated, with solid and cystic components related to hemorrhage or necrosis.

As opposed to breast cancer, calcification is unusual.MammographyOn mammography, metastatic lesions may manifest as single or multiple masses or as diffuse skin thickening. Metastases usually appear as round masses with circumscribed or ill-defined borders. They typically lack spiculation. Microcalcifications are rare can occur with some primary type (e.g, psammoma bodies in ovarian cancer).UltrasoundOn ultrasound, metastatic masses tend to have circumscribed margins with low-level internal echoes and, occasionally, posterior acoustic enhancement. Color Doppler interrogation most often shows increased vascularity.History and etymologyThe first case of a metastatic lesion to the breast is thought to have been reported by Trevithick in 1903 4.Differential diagnosisOn mammography several other primary breast lesions may easily mimic that of a typical well-defined metastasis which may be benign or malignant: benignfibroadenoma  malignant mucinous breast cancer medullary breast cancer papillary breast cancer   Rarely, metastasis to the breast may be spiculated and mimic an invasive ductal carcinoma.

__label__Musculoskeletal __label__Oncology Metastatic melanoma is known for its aggressive nature and for its ability to metastasize to a variety of atypical locations, which is why it demonstrates poor prognostic characteristics. On this page:  Article: Epidemiology Pathology Radiographic features Treatment and prognosis Differential diagnosis Related articles References   Images:Cases and figures  EpidemiologyMelanoma accounts for ~5% of all skin cancers, however, it remains the leading cause of death amongst skin cancers. The risk of metastatic progression has a strong association with the site of the initial primary melanoma, with melanomas arising from the head, neck and trunk carrying a higher risk of metastatic progression than those melanomas arising from the limbs 1,2.PathologyThe initial clinical staging of the primary malignant melanoma is essential and incorporates clinical and/or radiological evaluation for metastatic disease.  The Breslow thickness and Clarke level of cutaneous melanoma classification has been widely discussed, as has the TNM staging protocol.The most frequent site of involvement of metastatic disease is the lymphatic system, in particular the local and regional lymph nodes surrounding the primary melanoma. Further lymph node involvement typically progresses in a contiguous fashion 3.The detection of melanoma spread to the lymph nodes is the most important predictor of survival and eventual disease recurrence with poor survival outcomes associated with sentinel lymph node involvement even after the initial removal of the sentinel lymph node and the surrounding nodal basin 4.Radiographic featuresRadiological assessment plays a vital role in both the initial diagnosis of metastatic melanoma and in assessing disease progression and treatment efficacy.Nodal metastasesMetastatic spread to the lymph nodes represents the most common site of malignant melanoma metastases.Ultrasoundlymph nodes with metastatic disease may have an irregular, hypoechoic or lobulated appearance 3 CT imaging modality of choice to assess for nodal metastases increased regional nodal size and nodal heterogeneity have implications for metastatic disease Thoracic metastasesThe lungs and pleura are the second most common site of malignant melanoma metastases after lymph node involvement, with 85% of end-stage melanoma patients having evidence of lung metastases at autopsy 4.PET-CT when combined with dedicated CT interpretation this remains the most sensitive imaging modality to characterize the extent of thoracic melanoma metastases 3,5,6   pulmonary metastases are most commonly multiple rounded and sharply delineated lesions may less frequently present as a solitary pulmonary nodule  mediastinal and hilar nodal involvement are common 5,6  CNS and head/neck metastasesMetastatic melanoma remains the third most common cause of intracranial metastases, behind both lung and breast cancer 3.MRIImaging modality of choice for the interpretation of intracerebral metastases, demonstrating improved sensitivity and specificity when compared to contrast-enhanced CT 7.Metastatic intracerebral lesions are most frequently seen involving the cortex and are then seen less frequently to involve the grey/white matter junction, the dura and the leptomeninges 3,4.  T1: typically hyperintense due to a reduction in T1 relaxation time associated with the presence of melanin  T2: reduced T2 signal  T1 C+ (Gd): demonstrates peripheral rim enhancement with a heterogeneous pattern of enhancement 3  Abdominal and pelvic metastasesMelanoma metastases to the liver are the most common metastases involving the abdomen and pelvis and have been found in approximately 60-70% of melanoma patients at the time of autopsy 4,8.CT single or multiple hepatic metastatic lesions which may be hypervascular on the arterial phase and hypodense on the portal venous phase rim enhancement with central necrotic features is commonly seen hepatic melanoma metastases often demonstrate low attenuation when compared to normal hepatic parenchyma on CT 3,9  MRIFindings are similar to those previously described for intracranial metastatic melanoma: T1: hyperintensity secondary to the melanin content of melanocytes care must be taken when diagnosing these lesions as other lesions can also demonstrate T1W hyperintensity due to associated hemorrhage  PET-CTWhen combined with dedicated CT, it a sensitivity of 98% and a specificity of 94% for detecting metastatic melanoma 3. Sites of metastases are normally FDG avid.Skeletal metastasesappear as lytic lesions most commonly involving the axial skeleton 4,5Treatment and prognosisTreatment of metastatic melanoma is complex and depends entirely upon the extent and site of pathological disease involvement. Wide excision of the identified primary tumor is the initial treatment of choice, however, if regional node involvement is suspected then lymphadenectomy can be performed.A combination of regional/systemic chemotherapy with associated immunotherapy and/or radiation therapy can be employed depending upon the individual clinical context.Metastatic melanoma has a poor prognosis due to its aggressive nature and survival rates depend upon the staging of the disease. Patients with a single regional lymph node involvement have a 5-year survival rate of 80%, which then decreases depending upon the number of regional nodes involved. Individuals with evidence of distal disease have a poor prognosis with 5-year survival estimates being 22% for distal nodal involvement and fall to 8% for patients with other identified visceral metastatic disease 3.Differential diagnosisGeneral imaging differential considerations include: other hypervascular metastatic disease  lymphoma leukemia Kaposi sarcoma primary gastrointestinal tract malignancies 
__label__Oncology __label__Chest Metastatic pulmonary calcification (MPC) is a form of pulmonary calcification where there is calcium deposition in normal lung parenchyma. It is most commonly due to chronic renal failure.  On this page:  Article: Terminology Clinical presentation Pathology Radiographic features Treatment and prognosis See also References   Images:Cases and figures  TerminologyMetastatic pulmonary calcification is an unfortunate term in that "metastatic" suggests a malignant process, but in fact purely refers to the spread to and deposition of the excess calcium in the lungs. In truth, malignancy is only very rarely the etiology. The calcification refers to a cellular pathological process, and it is not unusual to see no calcification on imaging at all.Clinical presentationThe majority of patients are asymptomatic. In a small minority dyspnea and a chronic dry cough are seen. Rarely, severe respiratory failure and death may result 13.PathologyIt is one of two types of tissue calcification and occurs when calcium is deposited in previously normal tissue, in contrast to dystrophic calcification that occurs in previously damaged tissue 12.CausesIt can occur in a variety of benign and malignant disorders such as:  chronic renal failure: considered the commonest cause 5   primary and secondary hyperparathyroidism  sarcoidosis vitamin D intoxication intravenous calcium therapy milk-alkali syndrome multiple myeloma massive osteolysis caused by metastases DistributionMetastatic pulmonary calcification is typically most marked in the upper lobes. This is thought to be due to a higher ventilation-to-perfusion ratio in the apices, hence less CO2 pressure and a more alkaline environment.Radiographic featuresPlain radiographThe plain chest radiograph is typically normal due to its inherent insensitivity in detecting the often small quantities of calcium present. Indeed the most common pattern - if any abnormality is present at all - is non-specific air space consolidation, mimicking pulmonary edema or pneumonia.CTSeveral CT patterns have been described.It is usually characterized by centrilobular fluffy ground-glass nodular opacities that may or may not appear calcified. Very rarely, ring-like calcification may be seen 5.Other less common patterns include 11: consolidation with high attenuation small dense nodules peripheral reticular opacities associated with small calcified nodules ground-glass opacities without centrilobular ground-glass nodular opacity Rarely, the following may also be present: vascular calcification within the chest wall pleural effusion Nuclear medicineBone scanIncreased uptake in pulmonary opacities is confirmatory, and may precede any apparent findings on the plain chest radiography.Treatment and prognosisOverall prognosis will depend on the underlying cause.The condition may be reversible, and a resolution of the radiological findings, and also symptoms, has been reported, following curative parathyroidectomy, renal transplant, or definitive dialysis 13.See also  pulmonary calcification differential diagnosis of calcified pulmonary densities calcified pulmonary metastases calcified pulmonary nodules   pulmonary ossification calcific uremic arteriolopathy

__label__Central __label__Nervous __label__System The metencephalon (plural: metencephala or metencephalons) is a secondary brain vesicle derived from the rhombencephalon, formed in the 5th week of embryonic life. Development     The metencephalon goes on to form the pons, the majority of the cerebellum and the fourth ventricle. The most rostral portion of the cerebellum receives contributions from the mesencephalon, and the floor of the fourth ventricle is derived in part from the myelencephalon 1.The pons is involved in the relay of signals between multiple brain regions. The cerebellum plays an integral role in coordination of movements. PathologyCerebellar dysgenesis may lead to syndromes of disordered movement of the eyes or body.

It is instead used as a constituent of a large number of industrial and commercially available solvents, cleaning products and antifreeze liquids 1.The increased toxicity compared to ethanol is due to its metabolism. Methanol is first metabolized into formaldehyde by alcohol dehydrogenase 4. Formaldehyde is then nearly completely metabolized into formate (formic acid) by aldehyde dehydrogenase 4. Formate is highly toxic respiratory chain metabolism toxin and inhibits cytochrome oxidase causing cell hypoxia (causing necrosis of tissue), metabolic acidosis, and optic nerve demyelination 4.It is thought that the putamen is particularly affected by this process due to its high metabolic demands 1, but this remains a subject of ongoing research.

__label__Spine __label__Central __label__Nervous __label__System Methotrexate-induced myelopathy is an uncommon toxic manifestation of intrathecal methotrexate administration that closely mimics subacute combined degeneration of the cord but with normal vitamin B12 and copper 1,2. It is far less common than methotrexate-related leukoencephalopathy. On this page:  Article: Epidemiology Clinical presentation Pathology Radiographic features Treatment and prognosis References   EpidemiologyMethotrexate-induced myelopathy is rare with only case reports and small series reported. As intrathecal methotrexate is most commonly administered for the treatment of hematologic malignancies, especially acute lymphocytic leukemia, the epidemiology of affected individuals largely matches that of the underlying diseases with most being children or young-to-middle-aged adults 1,2.Clinical presentationThe clinical presentation of affected individuals relates to dorsal column impairment with bilateral paresthesia, lower-limb weakness and bowel and/or bladder dysfunction 2. CSF levels of myelin basic protein and homocysteine are often elevated 2. PathologyAlthough clinically and radiologically methotrexate-induced myelopathy is indistinguishable from subacute combined degeneration of the cord it is not believed to be due to abnormal vitamin B12 or copper metabolism 1. Rather, it has been postulated that methotrexate results in the disruption of normal methionine synthesis from homocysteine resulting in both the elevated levels of homocysteine detectable in CSF and the reduction of S-adenosylmethionine (synthesized from methionine) that is important in the maintenance of normal myelin sheaths 3. At present, however, it is unclear if this results in demyelination 3, or some form of axonal damage 2. Interpretation of postmortem samples has been complicated by concurrent radiation effects 2.Radiographic featuresMRIMRI demonstrates imaging features indistinguishable to subacute combined degeneration of the cord with bilateral long segment dorsal column high T2 signal 1-3. Treatment and prognosisUnfortunately, treatment with vitamin B12 and folate supplementation does not appear effective 2. 
__label__Chest Methotrexate lung disease is the specific etiological type of drug-induced lung disease. It can occur due to the administration of methotrexate which is an antimetabolite, which is given for various reasons but commonly to treat rheumatoid arthritis. It is also given alone or in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents to treat a wide variety of malignancies including lung, breast, and head and neck epidermoid cancers, non-metastatic osteosarcoma, and advanced-stage non-Hodgkin lymphoma. On this page:  Article: Epidemiology Clinical presentation Pathology Radiographic features Treatment and prognosis See also Related articles References   Images:Cases and figures  EpidemiologyIt is thought to occur in ~5% (range 0.3-10%) of patients treated with methotrexate 1-2.Clinical presentationThe typical clinical symptoms include progressive shortness of breath and cough, often associated with fever 6. Hypoxemia and tachypnea are always present and crackles are frequently audible. Symptoms typically manifest within months of starting therapy).

__label__Central __label__Nervous __label__System Methotrexate-related leukoencephalopathy, resulting from administration of the drug methotrexate, is an uncommon yet important type of toxic encephalopathy. Methotrexate is administered via oral, intravenous, or intrathecal routes for many clinical indications, but its use as a chemotherapy agent for hematological and other malignancies is particularly relevant in regards to its neurotoxic effects. Neurotoxicity related to methotrexate can manifest in a spectrum of acute and chronic leukoencephalopathies 1,2, and while acute manifestations tend to be transient, chronic methotrexate-related encephalopathy can result in permanent neurological deficits 1. On this page:  Article: Epidemiology Clinical presentation Pathology Radiographic features Treatment and prognosis Related articles References   Images:Cases and figures  EpidemiologyMethotrexate-related leukoencephalopathy most often occurs in pediatric patients during treatment for acute lymphoblastic leukemia but can occur in patients of any age with other indications for methotrexate administration 1,2.The risk of developing acute leukoencephalopathy appears to be dose-dependent 1,3. High-dose intravenous methotrexate, such as that used for malignancies, has been associated with the development of acute leukoencephalopathy in 3-15% of cases, with recurrence rates of 10-56% if therapy is continued 2. Intrathecal administration is associated with an even higher increased risk of acute leukoencephalopathy when compared to high-dose intravenous administration 1.Clinical presentationAcute methotrexate-related leukoencephalopathy often manifests 2-14 days after administration, with clinical features similar to other encephalopathies 1,4. These clinical features develop over minutes to hours, with common manifestations including a headache, confusion, disorientation, lethargy, seizures, and focal neurological deficits that may be unilateral or bilateral 1,2,5. Of note, and unlike many other encephalopathies, these clinical features often 'wax and wane' over the course of the disease 2. For example, focal neurological deficits may initially manifest on one side of the body and then 'alternate' to affect the other side of the body later 2.While this acute syndrome is transient, with recovery occurring within 1-7 days of symptom onset, chronic methotrexate-related leukoencephalopathy develops more slowly and ultimately results in permanent focal neurological deficits 1. In addition to causing neurotoxicity, methotrexate is also associated with myelosuppression, mucositis, lung disease, nephrotoxicity, and hepatotoxicity 1.PathologyMethotrexate (C20 H22 N8 O5) is a cell cycle-specific folate analog, that in malignancy, works by competitively inhibiting dihydrofolate reductase and thus, depleting DNA precursors 1,6. However, the mechanism by which methotrexate causes leukoencephalopathy is unclear 2. It has been postulated that methotrexate has a role in promoting the release of adenosine which is known to play a role in dilating cerebral blood vessels, altering neuronal function, and causing transient cytotoxic edema 1,2.Radiographic featuresGenerally, there are no CT or MRI features that are characteristic of acute methotrexate-related leukoencephalopathy when compared to other toxic encephalopathies 2. CTCT changes are non-specific, primarily demonstrating low attenuation in the white matter of both cerebral hemispheres 1,2. MRIGenerally, patients have transient diffuse high signal in the centrum semiovale, initially sparing subcortical U-fibers, as seen on T2-weighted and FLAIR MRI sequences, with corresponding hypodense lesions that may be appreciated on conventional CT  1,2. These changes may be unilateral, bilateral, or ultimately, alternating between the two over the course of the disease 1,2.However, what does seem promising as a characteristic radiological marker are the changes appreciated on DWI MRI that are indicative of cytotoxic edema 2. Scans will often demonstrate regions of true restricted diffusion across multiple vascular territories in the centrum semiovale, again either unilateral, bilateral, or alternating, that eventually disappear after symptom resolution 1,2. These DWI changes are thought to be reliable and early signs of acute methotrexate-related leukoencephalopathy 2.  Treatment and prognosisEvidence-based management of acute methotrexate-related leukoencephalopathy remains limited. Case series-level evidence suggests that aminophylline, a non-selective adenosine receptor agonist, and leucovorin, an active form of folinic acid, may be beneficial in isolation or in combination for acute leukoencephalopathy 2,7,8. It is uncertain whether these agents have any role in prophylaxis 2. Antiepileptic agents may also have a role in patients with seizures 2. The decision to restart methotrexate therapy should be made on a case-by-case basis depending on the severity of the leukoencephalopathy, an assessment of risks and benefits, and a discussion with the patient and/or their family 2.
__label__Central __label__Nervous __label__System O6-Methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) is a DNA repair enzyme which is important in predicting the effects of alkylating chemotherapeutic agents (e.g. temozolomide) in the treatment of glioblastomas (GBM).MGMT methylation is very common in low-grade gliomas (80%) 2 and is almost invariably present in low-grade tumors with IDH mutations 3. In contrast, MGMT methylation is far less common in higher grade gliomas (WHO grade III and IV), found in only 35-45% of such tumors 2. AssessmentMGMT methylation can be assessed with numerous techniques and no uniform consensus has been reached in regards to which technique is the most appropriate in clinical practice. Immunohistochemistry, nonquantitative methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction (MSP) and sequencing have all been used. Viable (non-necrotic) tissue must be sampled to avoid false negative results 2. Prognostic impactHigh activity of MGMT (i.e. unmethylated) results in reduced efficacy of alkylating agents, and thus is a poor prognostic factor 1,2. On the other hand, when the MGMT promoter is methylated, there is decreased activity of MGMT and thus alkylating agents are more effective. In other words, identification of methylated-MGMT is a positive prognostic factor 1. It is also predictive of pseudoprogression following Stupp protocol 2.
__label__Central __label__Nervous __label__System A methyl methacrylate cranial prosthesis is of heterogeneous density, similar to muscle, and contains locules of gas. The most common cause of a bony defect is trauma, and repair of the defect is called a cranioplasty.The methyl methacrylate is the monomer form of the final plastic material, typically the supplied preparation consists of separate powdered polymeric and liquid monomeric forms, which are combined by the surgeon, in a two parts powder to one part liquid ratio, to form the moldable polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) cement. Polymerization is an exothermic process, which may reach 70 °C, and therefore cannot be allowed to occur in vivo due to the clear risk of thermal injury to surrounding soft tissues 3.In the usual situation the excised bone can be placed back into the defect (autologous cranioplasty). In some cases the bone is no longer viable, and a synthetic prosthesis must be sought. These may be fashioned in theater as required, cast to a direct mold of the patient’s skull fragment, or rebuilt using data from CT scans of both the patient’s bone defect and the bone fragment.Gas within a methyl methacrylate cranioplasty is often due to the manufacture process and does not imply infection. Epidural gas or soft-tissue swelling on CT may be suggestive, but clinical assessment is the key to diagnosing infection. Infection occurs in around 4% of prostheses, and is more common when the frontal sinuses are involved.Other factors which may lead to complications with methyl methacrylate cranioplasties include a large defect, pre-existing infection, and local radiotherapy

For the purpose of this article, the two will be used interchangeably. On this page:  Article: Terminology Epidemiology Clinical features Pathology Radiographic features See also Related articles References   Images:Cases and figures  TerminologyAs with most terms that describe a relative size the definition varies from publication to publication. In fetal imaging, it is usually defined as fetal head measurements (e.g. head circumference) falling under two standard deviations expected for gestation or falling under the 3rd percentile. The same definition is sometimes applied to children and adults. It is important to note that this means that the majority of these individuals are actually normal, but small. Other authors advocate the use of three standard deviations which increases specificity and narrows the diagnosis to less than 1% of the population and more closely correlates with abnormal development 6. Microcephaly can be divided into primary (or true) or secondary microcephaly. In primary microcephaly, the brain never forms normally whereas in secondary microcephaly normal continued brain development is arrested by some defined insult/event. The terms congenital and acquired can also be used which only partially overlap with primary and secondary. EpidemiologyThe estimated incidence varies according to definition but when pathological it usually results from deficient brain development. As it is seen in a very large number of conditions (see below) it, therefore, a similarly large demographic spread. Clinical featuresMost cases of microcephaly (regardless of associated anomalies) have an intellectual disability. Recognized associations with microcephaly are protean and include  aneuploidic syndromictrisomy 13   non-aneuploidic syndromic Coffin-Lowry syndrome Coffin-Siris syndrome Cornelia de Lange syndrome Feingold syndrome Freeman Sheldon syndrome holoprosencephaly spectrum due to in utero substance / drug exposure fetal warfarin syndrome fetal hydantoin syndrome fetal alcohol syndrome   in utero infections fetal rubella syndrome congenital cytomegalovirus infection Zika virus   Miller-Dieker syndrome Neu-Laxova syndrome Rett syndrome Roberts syndrome  Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome 3  Ruvalcaba-Myhre-Smith syndrome Seckel syndrome Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome Walker-Warburg syndrome    other isolated features microphthalmia hypotelorism  cephaloceles/encephaloceles    PathologyMany gene products and some genes have been identified which result in microcephaly, and have aided the development of a more detailed classification 7.Radiographic featuresAntenatal ultrasoundThe detection of microcephaly usually becomes easier as the gestation advances. The small head is best assessed by using the head circumference (HC). Measurement of the biparietal diameter (BPD) is not helpful in diagnosing microcephaly as the head shape can be misleading 1.In addition, the diagnosis should be reserved for cases where there is a significant discrepancy between the head size and the rest of the body. CT and MRIBoth MRI and - to a lesser degree - CT are able to assess the underlying brain. The forebrain is usually most affected and often a degree of simplification of cortical structure (shallow sulci, reduced in number/abnormal sulcation) is evident 6,7.See also atelencephalic microcephaly megalencephaly

__label__Oncology __label__Breast Microinvasive carcinoma is a type of epithelial breast cancer in which microscopic foci of tumor cells infiltrate the breast stroma. On this page:  Article: Pathology Radiographic appearance Treatment and prognosis References   PathologyMicroinvasive carcinoma is defined histologically as one or more clearly separate foci of tumor cells ≤1 mm in size infiltrating the mammary stroma 1. It nearly always occurs in association with carcinoma in situ, typically high grade ductal carcinoma in situ, and uncommonly lobular carcinoma in situ 1.StagingMicroinvasive carcinoma is staged as T1mi in the TNM system for breast tumors.Radiographic appearanceMammographyWhen microinvasive carcinoma arises in the setting of high grade ductal carcinoma in situ, mammography typically detects calcifications, less commonly a mass, and even less commonly an asymmetry or architectural distortion 1,2.UltrasoundIn case series, the most common sonographic finding is a solid hypoechoic mass 2.MRIThe dominant MRI findings are non-mass enhancement that is heterogeneous or clustered ring in internal pattern, segmental in distribution, and showing strong initial enhancement with delayed washout kinetics 3.Treatment and prognosisOutcomes are similar to that of pure ductal carcinoma in situ 1,4. Therefore, microinvasive carcinoma is managed like high grade ductal carcinoma in situ, i.e. with some combination of surgery, radiation therapy, and/or endocrine therapy.

Whilst intimal and subintimal fibrosis and fragmentation of the elastic media are seen, arteritis and atherosclerosis are characteristically absent in this condition. Elastin arteriopathy in Williams syndrome can rarely be a cause 5. Radiographic featuresAngiographyWhilst involvement of any portion of the abdominal aorta may be seen, the interrenal segment including the origins of the renal arteries is often narrowed. Typically enlarged splanchnic collaterals (e.g. inferior mesenteric artery, arc of Riolan, the marginal artery of Drummond) are noted. The aortic bifurcation and iliac arteries are spared 3.UltrasoundOn gray‐scale imaging, segmental narrowing or tortuosity can be detected in the distal thoracic and the abdominal aorta. Color Doppler can demonstrate aliasing while spectral Doppler can show elevated peak systolic velocities in the narrowed vessels (often ranging around 230~480 cm/s) 9. Tardus‐parvus waveforms can be seen in the vessels distally of the stenosis.Treatment and prognosisEndovascular treatment is the preferred mode as it is a minimally invasive treatment option. Balloon expandable stents / stent-grafts are usually placed to expand the lumen of the aorta. Complex endovascular/surgical options such as fenestrated grafts with re-implantation of the renal arteries will be required if the renal arteries are involved.Without treatment, life expectancy is dramatically shortened with most dying of ischemic/hypertensive complications by age 40 4.Differential diagnosisImaging differential considerations include 2: Takayasu arteritis neurofibromatosis 
__label__Central __label__Nervous __label__System The midbrain, or mesencephalon (plural: mesencephala or mesencephalons), is the most rostral part of the brainstem and sits above the pons and is adjoined rostrally to the thalamus. During development, the midbrain forms from the middle of three vesicles that arise from the neural tube.When viewed in cross-section, the midbrain can be divided into three portions:  tectum (posterior) tegmentum  cerebral peduncles (anterior) Sitting posteriorly, the tectum is composed of the tectal (quadrigeminal) plate and superior and inferior colliculi. The tectum is unique to the midbrain and does not have a counterpart in the rest of the brainstem.The tegmentum (Latin for "covering") is the phylogenetically-old part of the brainstem and runs through the pons and medulla oblongata. In the adult brain, it contains all the brainstem nuclei.Anterior to the tegmentum are the cerebral peduncles which are composed of the large ascending and descending tracts that run to and from the cerebrum.Blood supplyThe midbrain is supplied by the vertebrobasilar circulation, from small penetrating branches of the: basilar artery superior cerebellar artery posterior cerebral artery Related pathology Benedikt syndrome Claude syndrome Nothnagel syndrome Weber syndrome midbrain glioma

__label__Vascular __label__Central __label__Nervous __label__System The middle cerebral artery (MCA) is one of the three major paired arteries that supply blood to the brain. The MCA arises from the internal carotid artery as the larger of the two main terminal branches (the other being the anterior cerebral artery), coursing laterally into the lateral sulcus where it branches to perfuse the cerebral cortex.Gross anatomySegmentsThe MCA is divided into four segments:  M1 (sphenoidal or horizontal segment) originates at the terminal bifurcation of the internal carotid artery courses laterally parallel to the sphenoid ridge terminates either: at the genu adjacent to the limen insulae, where it makes a right angle turn 5  at the main bifurcation 6       M2 (insular segment) originates at the genu/limen insulae or the main bifurcation (see above) courses posterosuperiorly in the insular cleft terminates at the circular sulcus of insula, where it makes a right angle to hairpin turn    M3 (opercular segment) originates at the circular sulcus of the insula courses laterally along the frontoparietal operculum  terminates at the external/superior surface of the Sylvian fissure     M4 (cortical segment) originates at the external/top surface of the Sylvian fissure courses superiorly on the lateral convexity terminates at their final cortical territory   BranchesM1 medial lenticulostriate penetrating arteries lateral lenticulostriate penetrating arteries anterior temporal artery polar temporal artery  uncal artery (which may branch from the anterior choroidal artery) orbitofrontal branch (same territory as orbitofrontal artery) M2Division of the MCA is variable after the horizontal segment, although most commonly, it divides into two trunks, superior and inferior: 78% bifurcate into superior and inferior divisions 12% trifucate into superior, middle and inferior divisions 10% branch into many smaller branches Superior terminal branch lateral frontobasal artery prefrontal sulcal artery pre-Rolandic (precentral) and Rolandic (central) sulcal arteries Inferior terminal branch three temporal branches (anterior, middle, posterior) angular artery two parietal branches (anterior, posterior) SupplyThe middle cerebral arteries supply the majority of the lateral surface of the hemisphere, except the superior portion of the parietal lobe (via the ACA) and the inferior portion of the temporal lobe and occipital lobe (via the PCA). In addition, they supply part of the internal capsule and basal ganglia.In its territory lie the motor and sensory areas excluding leg and perineum and auditory and speech areas.Variant anatomy  MCA duplication: reported incidence of ~1.5% (range 0.2-2.9%); parallels the main MCA and supplies the anterior temporal lobe accessory MCA  MCA fenestration is rare with a report incidence of <1% early branching of the MCA-bifurcation/trifurcation occurs within 1 cm of its origin

__label__Central __label__Nervous __label__System __label__Vascular The middle cerebral artery territory is the most commonly affected territory in a cerebral infarction, due to the size of the territory and the direct flow from internal carotid artery into the middle cerebral artery, providing the easiest path for thromboembolism. On this page:  Article: Clinical presentation Radiographic features Treatment and prognosis Related articles References   Images:Cases and figures  Clinical presentationThe neurological deficit will depend on the extent of the infarct and hemispheric dominance, and include: contralateral hemiparesis contralateral hemisensory loss hemianopia aphasia: if the dominant hemisphere is involved; may be expressive in anterior MCA territory infarction, receptive in posterior MCA stroke, or global with extensive infarction neglect: non-dominant hemisphere Radiographic featuresGenerally, the features are those of cerebral infarction, similar to those seen in any other territory. As such these features are discussed in generic article: cerebral infarction.There are however certain features specific to middle cerebral artery infarct, and these are discussed below. For both CT and MRI it is worth dividing the features according to time course.It should also be noted that middle cerebral artery infarcts are often incomplete affecting only perforator branches or one or more distal branches. As such in many cases, only parts of the middle cerebral artery territory are affected.CTThe earliest finding of middle cerebral artery occlusion is: hyperdense middle cerebral artery sign 3 seen immediately and represents direct visualization of the thromboembolism. presence of calcification is important as it is a contraindication to angioplasty  Early parenchymal signs include subtle blurring, decreased attenuation and swelling of the grey-white matter junction of affected regions.

__label__Head __label__& __label__Neck The middle ear or middle ear cavity, also known as tympanic cavity or tympanum (plural: tympanums/tympana), is an air-filled chamber in the petrous part of the temporal bone. It is separated from the external ear by the tympanic membrane, and from the inner ear by the medial wall of the tympanic cavity. It contains the three auditory ossicles whose purpose is to transmit sound vibrations from the tympanic membrane to the oval window of the lateral wall of the inner ear.  On this page:  Article: Gross anatomy Arterial supply Venous drainage Lymphatic drainage Innervation History and etymology Related pathology Related articles References   Images:Cases and figures  Gross anatomyThe tympanic cavity is subdivided into several parts defined in relation to the planes of the tympanic membrane. Some authors define three compartments 4:   mesotympanum, directly medial to the membrane  epitympanum (attic, epitympanic recess), superior to the membrane  hypotympanum, inferior to the membrane In addition to these compartments, some authors define two more compartments 5:  protympanum, anterior to the membrane  retrotympanum, posterior to the membrane The middle ear is shaped like a narrow box with concave sides. It has six "walls": the tegmental wall (roof): Formed by the tegmen tympani, a thin plate of petrous bone that also roofs in the canal for the tensor tympani muscle and the tympanic antrum. It separates the dura mater on the floor of the middle cranial fossa from the tympanic cavity. the jugular wall (floor): Formed by the jugular plate that separates the tympanic cavity from the superior bulb of the internal jugular vein. the membranous (lateral) wall: This is formed entirely by the peaked convexity of the tympanic membrane and superiorly by the lateral bony wall of the epitympanic recess. the labyrinthine (medial) wall: This separates the tympanic cavity from the inner ear. The initial part (basal turn) of the cochlea forms the promontory of the labyrinthine wall. It also features the oval and round windows, which communicate with the inner ear. the mastoid (posterior) wall: This features the aditus (opening) to the mastoid antrum in its superior part, which connects the tympanic cavity to the mastoid cells. The canal for the facial nerve descends between the posterior wall and the antrum, medial to the aditus. Above this canal is the convex bulge of the lateral semicircular canal. Below the aditus there is a hollow conical projection, called the pyramid, which is perforated by the tendon of the stapedius muscle. the carotid (anterior) wall: This separates the tympanic membrane from the carotid canal. In its inferior aspect there is an opening of the Eustachian tube (also known as the pharyngotympanic or auditory tube) and the semicanal for the tensor tympani muscle.  ContentsBonesMiddle ear ossicles consist of three small bones (the malleus, incus and stapes), which form a mobile chain across the tympanic cavity from the tympanic membrane to the oval window.MusclesThere are two muscles, one attached to the malleus and one attached to the stapes, which act to damp down over-vibration from low-pitched sound waves. These are, respectively:  tensor tympani muscle (inserts into the handle of the malleus)  stapedius muscle (inserts into the neck of the stapes) NervesThe chorda tympani leaves the facial nerve in the facial canal and enters the tympanic cavity through the posterior wall, lateral to the pyramid, lying just underneath the mucous membrane. It runs over the pars flaccida of the tympanic membrane, and the neck of the malleus. It leaves at the anterior margin of the tympanic notch.Arterial supply anterior tympanic artery from the maxillary artery  stylomastoid artery from the posterior auricular or occipital arteries  numerous small vessels from the external carotid artery  Venous drainagedrainage to the pterygoid venous plexus or the superior petrosal sinus Lymphatic drainageLymphatic drainage is to the parotid, retropharyngeal and upper deep cervical nodes.InnervationThis is by the tympanic branch of the glossopharyngeal nerve (Jacobson nerve), which forms the tympanic plexus by combining with sympathetic fibers from the internal carotid nerve. Branches from the plexus supply sensory and vasomotor fibers to the mucous membrane of the tympanic cavity, as well as to the tympanic membrane and external auditory meatus.The middle and external ear are also supplied by branches of the trigeminal, facial, glossopharyngeal and vagus nerves which results in referred pain in the ear from other areas supplied by these nerves, e.g. the teeth, posterior part of the tongue, pharynx and larynx.The tympanic plexus gives off the lesser petrosal nerve, which supplies the parotid gland via the otic ganglion.History and etymologyTympanum is derived from τύμπανον (tumpanon) the Ancient Greek word for a drum.Related pathology middle ear granulation tissue otomastoiditis middle ear effusion hemotympanum tympanic membrane retraction eustachian tube dysfunction middle ear tumors cholesterol granuloma acquired cholesteatoma 
__label__Head __label__& __label__Neck Middle ear effusions are frequent in children due to prominent adenoids and horizontal Eustachian tubes.

__label__Head __label__& __label__Neck There are three tiny articulating bones in the middle ear known as ossicles (from lateral to medial): malleus incus stapes Their role is to mechanically amplify the vibrations of the tympanic membrane and transmit them to the cochlea where they can be interpreted as sound. They are located in the middle ear cavity and articulate with each other via two tiny synovial joints. The stapes also articulates with the oval window via the stapediovestibular joint, which is a syndesmosis 3; this joint transmits the ossicular vibrations to the endolymph in the vestibule.Interestingly, they are the only bones in the body that do not grow after birth, and are also the smallest bones in the body (variant tiny sesamoids aside).Radiographic featuresCTOn axial images (in the plane of the lateral semicircular canal), the normal landmarks of the ossicles can be remembered with the following mnemonic, from superior to inferior 4,5:  ice cream cone (level of horizontal tympanic segment of facial nerve): incudomallear joint involving head of malleus (ice cream) and body of incus (top of cone), and short process of incus (tip of cone) two dots (level of oval window): neck of malleus (lateral dot) and long process of incus (medial dot) two dashes: handle/manubrium of malleus (lateral line), incudostapedial joint involving lenticular process of incus and head of stapes (medial line)

__label__Gastrointestinal __label__Paediatrics Midgut volvulus is a complication of malrotated bowel. It may result in proximal bowel obstruction with resultant ischemia if prompt treatment is not instigated. On this page:  Article: Epidemiology Clinical presentation Pathology Radiographic features Treatment and prognosis Differential diagnosis References   Images:Cases and figures  EpidemiologyA midgut volvulus of malrotated bowel can potentially occur at any age but in approximately 75% of cases occur within a month of birth 4,6. Most of these are within the first week 3 with 90% occuring within 1 year 6.Clinical presentationTypically the neonate is entirely normal for a period before suddenly presenting with bilious vomiting. If the volvulus does not spontaneously reduce, then the venous obstruction created by the superior mesenteric vein wrapped around the superior mesenteric artery results in venous obstruction and gradual onset of ischemia and eventual necrosis. As this occurs, the abdomen becomes swollen as fluid accumulates in the lumen of the bowel, and becomes tender. Eventually, peritonitis and shock become established.PathologyMidgut volvulus occurs as a complication of intestinal malrotation.AssociationsThese include 8: gastroschisis omphalocele diaphragmatic hernia duodenal or jejunal atresia Radiographic featuresPlain radiographUnfortunately, plain radiographs are non-contributory appearing either normal early on or having appearances of a bowel obstruction or even pneumoperitoneum later in the course of the disease. Occasionally complete obstruction can lead to distension of the duodenal bulb and stomach leading to a double bubble sign 7.FluoroscopyA pediatric upper gastrointestinal contrast study is the examination of choice when the diagnosis is suspected. Not only is it able to identify the volvulus, but even in instances where spontaneous reduction has occurred, the underlying malrotation will be evident.In the setting of volvulus findings include: corkscrew sign tapering or beaking of the bowel in complete obstruction 3  malrotated bowel configuration Contrast enemas have also been used historically. The theory being that in malrotation the large bowel will also be malrotated. Unfortunately, in 20-30% of cases, the cecum is normally located. The converse is also true, with the position of the cecum in normal individuals being variable 3.UltrasoundUltrasound findings include 1-5: clockwise whirlpool sign  abnormal superior mesenteric vessels inverted SMA/SMV relationship solitary hyperdynamic pulsating SMA truncated SMA inapparent SMV   abnormal bowel dilated duodenum proximal to the obstruction thickened wall of small bowel distal to the obstruction dilated fluid-filled loops of small bowel   free intra-abdominal fluid CTCT is often carried out in older patients, in which presentation is non-specific. Findings include:  whirlpool sign of twisted mesentery malrotated bowel configuration inverted SMA/SMV relationship bowel obstruction free fluid/free gas in advanced cases Treatment and prognosisUrgent surgical repair (Ladd procedure) is required to prevent ischemia or to resect infarcted bowel loops. If resection is performed stomas are usually created. Additionally, the Ladd bands are divided and the mesenteric pedicle widened. In some instances, pexy (surgical fixation) of the duodenum and cecum may be performed although it is unclear if this is of benefit in preventing recurrence 6.  It should be noted that normal anatomical positioning is not achieved; the duodenum and small bowel remain on the right, and the cecum and colon are on the left side of the abdomen 6. Prognosis is dependent on the state of the small bowel and presence of systemic shock. In cases where no ischemia of the bowel is present, and the child is otherwise well, the prognosis is extremely good. Overall a mortality of 3-9% is reported 6.  Small bowel obstruction for adhesions is seen a distant complication in 5-10% of cases.Differential diagnosisVomiting in infancy has numerous causes and needs to be distinguished from normal possetting.

__label__Central __label__Nervous __label__System One of the most important indicators of increased intracranial pressure due to mass effect is midline shift. On this page:  Article: Pathology Radiographic features Practical points References   Images:Cases and figures  PathologyAny intra-axial or extra-axial lesion (tumor, hemorrhage, abscess, etc.) has the potential to exert mass effect on the brain parenchyma and cause lateral shift of the midline structures.Radiographic featuresPlain radiographBefore the advent of cross-sectional imaging, midline shift was assessed by displacement of the calcified pineal gland on a frontal radiograph of the skull.CT/MRIMidline shift is measured in millimeters, as the perpendicular distance between a midline structure (usually the septum pellucidum) and a line designated the midline.The midline is assumed to be coplanar with the falx cerebri, and is best represented as a line drawn between the anterior and posterior attachments of the falx to the inner table of the skull.Care must be taken if there is existing asymmetry of the ventricles or the falx. If the falx is not straight, a line between the free edges of the anterior and posterior falx can be used instead. The superior sagittal sinus can also be used to indicate the posterior falcine attachment provided it is truly midline and not coursing to one side as is seen sometimes with a dominant transverse sinus.Practical pointsThe amount of midline shift is one of the strongest indicators of neurosurgical prognosis and can be associated with other signs of increased intracranial pressure such as: effacement sulcal ventricular   asymmetry of the basal CSF cisterns   herniation subfalcine transtentorial tonsillar external   hydrocephalus

__label__Central __label__Nervous __label__System Migraines are a common primary headache disorder and can present variably. Typically they consist of debilitating headaches, accompanied by an aura in one-third of patients. Their etiology remains controversial, although changes in cerebral vessel reactivity are involved. On this page:  Article: Clinical presentation Pathology Radiographic features Differential diagnosis References   Images:Cases and figures  Clinical presentationMigraines are broadly divided into those with and those without auras 7.Migraines without aura usually consist of a headache that lasts 4 to 72 hours that is typically unilateral, moderate to severe and has a pulsating quality. The headache is often associated with photophobia, phonophobia and nausea and is worsened by physical activity 7. Migraines with aura are usually preceded by focal neurological deficits, although in some individuals the aura can occur concurrently with the headache 7. The neurological deficits can be very varied and last 5 to 60 minutes and eventually fully resolve. They are followed by headache within an hour of onset 7.In addition to auras and the headache, two other phases may be present: prodrome and postdrome. These may occur hours or even a couple of days before and after the migraine respectively. They typically comprise of one or more of the following: changes in mood, blurred vision, photophobia, phonophobia, fatigue, poor concentration and neck stiffness 7. PathologyThe classical explanation describes a headache (due to vasodilation) preceded by neurological symptoms, most classically visual (due to vasoconstriction).This classic pattern is relatively uncommon accounting for ~10% of the migrainous patients and is unlikely to be an accurate reflection of the pathophysiology involved. Radiographic featuresCTCT is usually unhelpful, except in cases of extensive cortical infarction.MRIIn the vast majority of cases, MRI is normal. In hemiplegic migraines, venous dilatation can be seen on SWI MIP images contralateral to the hemiparesis, although this is not typical 3. Changes in cerebral perfusion have also been described 3. MRI may demonstrate T2 hyperintensities in the white matter of the centrum semiovale, not dissimilar to small vessel deep white matter ischemic change. These are distinguished predominantly on history, although recent 3 T work 1 suggest that there is increased T2 signal in the cortex overlying white matter abnormalities as well as in the brainstem 1: migraine with aura: 8.1% migraine without aura: 2.2% controls: 0.7% Differential diagnosisFor MRI appearances consider: stroke chronic small vessel deep white matter ischemic change  multiple sclerosis/demyelination  cerebral vasculitis

__label__Cardiac Minimally invasive direct coronary artery bypass (MIDCAB) is a novel method for bypassing diseased coronary arteries that can replace open coronary artery bypass grafts (CABG) in certain situations, most commonly when bypassing the left anterior descending artery (LAD) with a left internal thoracic artery (LITA) graft. The main difference from traditional CABG is that sternotomy is avoided. The procedure is often performed without placing the patient on cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) ("off-pump" procedure).The procedure can be performed for multivessel disease as part of a hybrid procedure that includes percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).Coronary surgery that circumvents sternotomy and/or CPB results in lower perioperative morbidity and mortality rates compared to "traditional" CABG. 2 Patient selection criteria can thus be expanded to include older patients with significant comorbidities.

Thin-slice ECG-gated CT with reformations and 3D reconstructions afford the cardiac surgeon the ability to 4-6: identify patients suitable for MIDCAB, based on native artery anatomy and calcium score, as well as potential graft anatomy plan the approach visualize the exact locations of previously performed bypass grafts to avoid damaging them during the procedure MRIAs yet, CT is superior to cardiac MRI, as most MR machines in use today have lower spatial resolution and therefore cannot visualize small coronary artery anatomy as accurately as CT. In addition, MRI cannot be used to perform calcium scoring.AngiographyPreoperative and postoperative coronary angiography has been mostly eschewed in favor of coronary CT angiography. Catheter angiography is invasive in itself and suffers from limitations such as non-visualization of occluded grafts, inability to perform calcium scoring. It cannot reveal any relevant anatomy outside the vessel lumen, either, such as myocardial or epicardial fat bridging 6.

__label__Vascular __label__Trauma __label__Chest Minimal aortic injuries are traumatic aortic lesions that usually involve the intima and are recognized more frequently due to the use of high-resolution imaging. On this page:  Article: Epidemiology Pathology Radiographic features Treatment and prognosis Differential diagnosis Related articles References   Images:Cases and figures  EpidemiologyMinimal aortic injuries account for 10-28% of all blunt traumatic aortic injuries 1,6,7. The proportion of this type of aortic injury among overall blunt traumatic aortic injuries is higher in more recent studies due to the widespread use of multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) in trauma.   PathologyMinimal aortic injuries are on the low end of the spectrum of blunt traumatic aortic injury.  Various definitions of minimal aortic injury have been used in literature. They were originally defined as small (<1 cm) intimal flaps with no or minimal periaortic hematoma. Some authors have defined the injuries as post-traumatic abnormalities of the inner aortic wall projecting into the lumen with no evidence of an abnormality to the outer contour of the aorta.Like other blunt traumatic aortic injuries, the proposed mechanisms include: rapid deceleration shearing forces osseous pinch sudden increase in hydrostatic forces or water-hammer phenomenon Injuries limited to the intima usually do not compromise the resistance of the aortic wall and may heal spontaneously by endothelialization.Most minimal aortic injuries occur in the descending thoracic aorta, particularly the proximal portion at the aortic isthmus. Radiographic featuresCTCT angiography is the investigation of choice. With improvements in imaging technology, which allow a thinner CT slice thickness, minimal aortic injuries are being diagnosed more frequently.Minimal aortic injuries can present with: intimal irregularity or flap most common imaging appearance (~80%) 1  rounded, triangular or focal thin membrane-like filling defects   intraluminal aortic thrombus  intramural hematoma (~10%) 1  Treatment and prognosisSince intimal injuries may resolve spontaneously, minimal aortic injuries are amenable to non-operative or medical management and can be treated conservatively with anti-hypertensives, anticoagulants or both depending on the coexisting injuries. Limited data on the natural history of this type of aortic injury necessitates close imaging surveillance for detection of any potential complication or adverse evolution of the minimal aortic injury. In some institutions, endovascular repair is another option for treatment.Differential diagnosisNormal anatomic variants and conditions that can mimic minimal aortic injuries on CT include: breathing, arterial pulsation and other motion artefacts streaming of contrast  ductus diverticulum and ductus remnant infundibulum of a branch vessel 
__label__Chest Minimally invasive adenocarcinoma (MIA) of the lung is a relatively new category in the classification for adenocarcinoma of the lung.

On this page:  Article: Epidemiology Pathology Radiographic features  Treatment and prognosis  History and etymology  Related articles References   Images:Cases and figures  EpidemiologyThere is no significant gender predilection, unlike other lung cancer types which are more prevalent in men.PathologyMinimally invasive adenocarcinomas of the lung are localized adenocarcinomas measuring ≤3 cm and demonstrating either pure lepidic or predominant lepidic growth pattern, with neoplastic cells along the alveolar structures and ≤5 mm of stromal invasion 2. These lesions should not show necrosis, lymphatic, vascular, or pleural invasion. Three histopathological subtypes are recognized 2: non-mucinous: by far the most common subtype  mucinous: goblet cell (mucus-secreting), often multicentric, rare mixed Similar to the adenocarcinoma in situ, minimally invasive adenocarcinoma of the lung cannot be securely diagnosed without entire histologic sampling of the tumor 2. Radiographic features Nuclear medicineFDG PET-CTMinimally invasive adenocarcinomas may be associated with PET false-negative results, particularly when the lesions are small. FDG PET-CT is recommended when assessing subsolid ground-glass lung lesions that have a solid component measuring more than 8 mm 4. Treatment and prognosis Patients with minimally invasive adenocarcinoma of the lung have near 100% disease-specific survival when they are completely resected 2. Chemotherapy and radiotherapy are treatment alternatives, particularly for those patients that are not surgical candidates.  History and etymology The entity formerly known as bronchoalveolar carcinoma was first described by Malassez in 1876, as a bilateral, multinodular form of malignant lung tumor 6.The shifting terminology of non-invasive adenocarcinoma reflects both an increased utilization of immunohistochemical testing, as well as advances in personalized cancer treatment. Beginning with the 1999 World Health Organization guidelines, there has been an attempt to isolate purely non-invasive and minimally-invasive adenocarcinoma from more advanced adenocarcinoma, due to uniquely favourable prognosis in the former 7. Prior to the 2011 IASLC/ATS/ERS update 2, various forms of invasive disease remained lumped into the BAC category. Thus, scrapping the BAC classification was intended to further remove ambiguity.
__label__Chest Minimum intensity projection (MinIP) is a data visualization method that enables detection of low-density structures in a given volume. The algorithm uses all the data in a volume of interest to generate a single bidimensional image, in other words, it consists of projecting the voxel with the lowest attenuation value on every view throughout the volume onto a 2D image 1,3.The MinIP algorithm is almost identical to the MIP algorithm but, in the case of MinIP, for each XY coordinate, only the lowest Hounsfield value along the Z axis is represented. In this way, only the most hypodense structures of the volume are represented 1.So it is the optimal tool for the detection, localization, and quantification of ground-glass opacity, mosaic attenuation, traction bronchiectasis, cystic lung disease and linear attenuation patterns on chest CT 3,4. The MinIP algorithm is particularly useful for analyzing the bile tree and pancreatic duct, which are hypodense compared to surrounding tissue, especially in the pancreatic and portal phase of contrast agent administration 2.​

Mirizzi performed the first operative cholangiogram in 1931. He was named a Master Surgeon (Cirujano Maestro) in 1956 by the Argentinian Surgeons Society (Sociedad Argentina de Cirugía) 6.

__label__Obstetrics A miscarriage is the spontaneous termination of a pregnancy before 20 weeks of gestation. Fetal death after week 20 is termed fetal death in utero (FDIU). On this page:  Article: Terminology Epidemiology Clinical presentation Related articles References   Images:Cases and figures  TerminologyThe term miscarriage is preferred by many over 'abortion' due to the use of the latter for therapeutic pregnancy termination, and the perceived stigma attributed to it by some.Terminology varies greatly, as do the definitions of these terms. Commonly it is divided into: threatened miscarriage missed miscarriage inevitable miscarriage incomplete miscarriage complete miscarriage EpidemiologyApproximately 20-25% of all pregnancies experience a threatened miscarriage. Of these, 15-50% result in embryonic/fetal death. The rate of fetal loss is significantly lower in pregnancies which do not threaten to miscarry (only 2-7%). A miscarriage often occurs very early in the pregnancy, often without any alteration of the menstrual cycle and thus not perceived by the woman. When a woman has had three or more miscarriages, the term habitual miscarriage is used.Clinical presentationTypically presents with vaginal bleeding, pelvic pain, and cramping.

__label__Obstetrics A missed miscarriage, sometimes termed a missed abortion 3, is a situation when there is a non-viable fetus within the uterus, without symptoms of a miscarriage.  Radiographic featuresUltrasoundUltrasound diagnosis of miscarriage should only be considered when either a mean gestation sac diameter is ≥25 mm with no obvious yolk sac or a fetal pole with a crown rump length of ≥7mm without evidence of fetal cardiac activity. Transvaginal ultrasound is the mainstay in the diagnosis of miscarriage. Once the diagnosis of miscarriage is made based on the above ultrasound criteria, the patient can then be offered different types of management depending on their clinical status and patient's choice.Treatment and prognosisExpectant management is possible, with a "wait and watch" approach can be offered after careful counseling to women who have met the inclusion criteria: patient's preference once miscarriage is diagnosed based on ultrasound findings incomplete miscarriage For medical management misoprostol is the drug of choice.

It easily helps determine whether an IUCD is correctly positioned and can often help identify IUCD-related complications. Three-dimensional (3D) US is gaining recognition for its role in imaging IUCDs. Anteroposterior and lateral abdominal radiographs can be helpful in demonstrating an extrauterine IUCD.Rarely computed tomography (CT) is used for the assessment of IUCD position. More often IUCDs are incidentally visualized on CT. CT is the best modality for the evaluation of complications associated with intra-abdominal IUCDs, e.g. visceral perforation, abscess formation, and bowel obstruction.MRI is not typically used for evaluation of IUCD, but modern IUCDs are safely imaged with MRI and appear as signal voids.

__label__Central __label__Nervous __label__System There are numerous mitochondrial disorders that affect the neurological and muscular systems in a variety of ways:  Kearns-Sayre syndrome Leigh syndrome mitochondrial encephalopathy with lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) myoclonus epilepsy with ragged red fibers (MERRF)  mitochondrial deletion syndromes, e.g. POLG-related disorders  trichopoliodystrophy (also known as Menkes disease) PathologyAs spermatozoa are deficient of mitochondria, these diseases are only inherited from the mother. The genes are located in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) of which there is a degree of heterogeneity within the one individual: not all mitochondria share the same genetic material. The percentage of affected mitochondria will dictate the degree to which the disease is clinically manifested 1.Radiographic featuresThe findings are variable ranging from specific findings (uncommon) to non-specific abnormalities (most common) as well as normal appearing studies 5. Findings are discussed separately for each condition listed above but as a general rule of thumb bilateral deep grey matter involvement and peripheral white matter delayed myelination in young adults or children should suggest the diagnosis. This is especially the case if associated with an elevated lactate level on MRS.
__label__Central __label__Nervous __label__System Mitochondrial encephalomyopathy with lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) is one of many mitochondrial disorders. As mitochondria, which have their own DNA, are exclusively passed on from the mother these disorders are only inherited from the mother.On imaging, it manifests as multifocal stroke-like cortical lesions in different stages of evolution ("shifting spread" pattern), crossing the cerebral vascular territories, and showing a certain predilection to the posterior parietal and occipital lobes. MR spectroscopy may demonstrate elevated lactate in an otherwise normal appearing brain 3. On this page:  Article: Epidemiology Clinical presentation Pathology Radiographic features Differential diagnosis Related articles References   Images:Cases and figures  EpidemiologyAs the long name suggests, MELAS is characterized by 'stroke-like' episodes, typically in childhood or early adulthood (90% present before 40 years of age).Clinical presentationMELAS usually has a relapsing-remitting course, with or without superimposed accretion of permanent deficits. Clinical presentation is characterized by 1: most common stroke-like episodes seizures lactic acidosis   encephalopathy dementia muscle weakness deafness PathologyThe defect involves the respiratory chain (responsible for energy production). A point mutation at nucleotide 3243 mtDNA (A to G translocation) which encodes for transfer RNA (tRNA) for leucine is the most common cause of the condition. It is therefore thought that this abnormality results in abnormal protein production throughout the mitochondria and affects multiple parts of the respiratory chain. The exact mechanism notwithstanding, the net result is depletion of NAD+ and NADH+. This, in turn, results in a shift to anaerobic metabolism accounting for the buildup of lactic acid and renders the cortex susceptible to neuronal death 1. As some mitochondria are passed in the ovum, not all will have the mutant mtDNA. The percentage of mutated genes will affect the severity of clinical manifestations 1.DiagnosisTo make the diagnosis of MELAS identification of the most common pathogenic mtDNA variant (m.3243A>G) can be made on peripheral blood samples in 80% of patients. To identify non-m.3243A>G mutations additional testing or muscle biopsy may be required 5. Radiographic featuresCT multiple infarcts involving multiple vascular territories may be either symmetrical or asymmetrical  parieto-occipital and parieto-temporal involvement is most common    basal ganglia calcification 1,2more prominent feature in older patients  atrophy 2  MRI acute infarcts swollen gyri with increased T2 signal may enhance subcortical white matter involved increased signal on DWI (T2 shine through) with little if any change on ADC: thought to represent vasogenic rather than cytotoxic edema 3    chronic infarcts involving multiple vascular territories may be either symmetrical or asymmetrical  parieto-occipital and parieto-temporal most common   MR spectroscopy: may demonstrate elevated lactate in otherwise normal appearing brain parenchyma or in CSF 3,4.Digital subtraction angiography (DSA) usually normal enhancing gyri, presumably due to the breakdown of the blood-brain barrier and reperfusion hyperemia correlating with a blush on angiography 2  Differential diagnosisPossible differential considerations include: other mitochondrial disorders MERRF Leigh syndrome Kearns-Sayre syndrome   status epiliepticus viral encephalitis cerebral vasculitis Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease infarcts, due to embolism dissection moya moya  CADASIL: lesions are not subcortical

This technique creates a tissue bridge between the anterior and posterior leaflets employing one clip deployed through trans-septal catheterization.It is sometimes offered for patients suffering from severe symptomatic mitral regurgitation where surgery may not be possible due to inherent risks and other comorbidities (particularly for the elderly with comorbidities 2).Radiographic featuresPlain radiographThey present as small metallic devices overlying the expected position of the mitral valve.
__label__Cardiac __label__Chest Mitral annular calcification (MAC) refers to the deposition of calcium (along with lipid) in the annular fibrosa of the mitral valve. On this page:  Article: Epidemiology Clinical presentation Pathology Radiographic features Treatment and prognosis References   Images:Cases and figures  EpidemiologyAnnular calcification is seen in up to 35% of elderly patients. It is common in females over 65 years, in those with myxomatous degeneration of the mitral valve and those with elevated left ventricular pressures.Clinical presentationAlthough annular calcification is associated with mitral regurgitation, this is usually trivial and asymptomatic. Calcification of the annulus can however impede AV nodal conduction and therefore lead to varying degrees of heart block. Calcification of the leaflets can cause mitral stenosis.PathologyPathologically it is important to distinguish annular calcification from mitral valve leaflet calcification. In annular calcification, the diseased annulus is covered with intact endothelium. It can also undergo caseous necrosis and embolize to the brain.Compared to aortic valve calcification, calcification of the mitral annulus is not significantly associated with stenosis of the valve and it is no longer felt to represent an independent risk factor for stroke 1.AssociationsIt is also associated with an increased prevalence of severe obstructive coronary artery disease particularly in older (>65 years) age groups 2. It is more often seen in patients with chronic renal failure.Radiographic featuresPlain radiographOn a frontal chest radiograph, calcification is demonstrated in the expected location of the mitral valve.  It typically begins around the margins of the posterior leaflet forming a "J" or "C", eventually with anterior leaflet involvement the "C" closes forming an "O".CTCT is more sensitive for calcification of the annulus although it depends on the degree of motion artefact (which is a factor of heart rate and scan time).Treatment and prognosisAnnular calcification per se does not require any treatment. Instead, patients are managed according to the presence of heart block, mitral regurgitation (usually minimal) and other cardiovascular signs and symptoms. 
__label__Cardiac The mitral valve (MV) (or bicuspid valve) is one of the four cardiac valves. It is the atrioventricular valve that allows blood to flow from the left atrium to the left ventricle. It opens during diastole and closes during systole. The valve has anterior and posterior leaflets (cusps), the bases of which attach around the AV orifice to a fibrous ring, known as the mitral valve annulus (MVA), forming part of the fibrous skeleton of the heart. The chordae tendineae are thin strong inelastic fibrous cords that extend from the free edge of the cusps to the apices of the papillary muscles within the left ventricle. Both cusps receive chordae tendineae from both papillary muscles. The anterior cusp is thicker and more mobile than the posterior cusp, and in general the cusps of the mitral valve are smaller and thicker than those of the tricuspid valve.Related pathology mitral stenosis mitral regurgitation mitral valve disease rheumatic heart disease mitral valve prolapse mitral valve annular calcification parachute mitral valve mitral valve papillary muscle rupture History and etymologyThe Latin word mitra refers to a turban used to describe the ceremonial head-dress as worn by Catholic bishops (hence the modern word mitre).

__label__Cardiac Mitral valve calcification can refer to 1  mitral annular calcification (MAC) or  mitral valve leaflet calcification (MVL) 
__label__Cardiac Mitral valve disease mostly comprises two main functional abnormalities, which can occur in isolation or in combination: mitral regurgitation mitral stenosis In addition, other pathologies that affect the mitral valve include: mitral valve prolapse mitral annular calcification  mitral valve vegetations from infective endocarditis  The mitral valve can also be abnormal in a number of congenital cardiac anomalies.A normally functioning mitral valve should allow unimpeded blood flow into the left ventricle during diastole and should prevent backflow of blood into the left atrium during systole. See alsoparachute mitral valve
__label__Cardiac Mitral valve prolapse (MVP), also known as Barlow syndrome, is often defined as systolic bowing of the mitral leaflet more than 2 mm beyond the annular plane into the atrium 1. It is a common cause of mitral regurgitation (considered most frequent cause of severe non-ischemic mitral regurgitation 2). On this page:  Article: Epidemiology Clinical presentation Pathology Radiographic features Treatment and prognosis See also References   EpidemiologyMitral valve prolapse may affect up to 2-3% of the general population 3. Although often isolated it is also seen in individuals with connective tissue disorders. Another important association is adult polycystic kidney disease.Clinical presentationMitral valve prolapse is often asymptomatic, however some patients may experience atypical chest pain and palpitations. On cardiac auscultation, a characteristic late systolic murmur with mid-systolic click may be audible in the mitral region.PathologyMitral leaflet bowing is caused by rupture or elongation of the chordae tendineae (often due to myxomatous degeneration). The middle scallop of the posterior leaflet (P2 segment) is most often affected.Radiographic featuresUltrasound / echocardiographyIn mitral valve prolapse, the coaptation line lies behind the annular plane. On 2D echo, the diagnosis of a prolapse should be made in the parasternal or eventually the apical long-axis view and not on an apical four-chamber view, as the saddle shaped annulus could lead to a false positive diagnosis 5. Treatment and prognosisIt is usually repaired surgically. See also mitral valve disease normal anatomy of the mitral valve  
__label__Cardiac Mitral valve regurgitation, also known as mitral valve insufficiency or mitral valve incompetence, is a valvulopathy that describes leaking of the mitral valve during systole that causes blood to flow in the reverse direction from the left ventricle into the left atrium. On this page:  Article: Epidemiology Clinical presentation Pathology Radiographic features Treatment and prognosis Differential diagnosis See also References   Images:Cases and figures  EpidemiologyAccording to one study of the United States of America, mitral regurgitation affects approximately 2% of all adults 1. Furthermore, the prevalence of mitral regurgitation increases with age 1.Clinical presentationPresentation is dependent on whether the mitral valve disease represents acute or chronic regurgitation 1,2. Acute mitral regurgitationAcute mitral regurgitation presents with signs and symptoms of acutely decompensated congestive heart failure 1,2. Depending on the severity of the regurgitation, there may be progression into cardiogenic shock 1,2.Chronic mitral regurgitationIn chronic mitral regurgitation, there may be relative compensation with limited signs and symptoms 1,2. However, these patients tend to be very sensitive to small changes in intravascular volume and prone to cardiac failure 1,2.Clinical examination classically reveals a volume loaded (‘thrusting’) apex beat and a pansystolic (holosystolic) murmur that is heard on praecordial auscultation 1,2. The murmur may radiate to to the left axilla in posterior leaflet disease or to the back in anterior leaflet disease 1,2.PathologyPatients with chronic mitral regurgitation, in the initial stages of the disease, compensate with more complete left ventricular emptying, resulting in a supraphysiological ejection fraction 1,2. In order to maintain sufficient forward cardiac output, this compensatory mechanism is met with an increased diastolic volume 1,2. This, over time, results in increased compliance of the walls of the left atrium and ventricle as they respond to volume overload in both chambers 1,2. In particular, left atrial enlargement can be responsible for development of arrhythmias and symptoms of atrial mass-effect on adjacent structures 1,2.Eventually this mechanism fails, and the left ventricle can not compensate for the volume overload 1,2. This causes the stroke volume to decrease and the cardiac output to decrease 1,2. This volume overload eventually causes a drop in forward cardiac output 1,2. This results in an increased end-systolic volume and pressure, causing pulmonary venous hypertension and heart failure 1,2. It is at this point where the ejection fraction may fall, signifying severe mitral regurgitation 1,2.In contrast, in acute mitral regurgitation, sudden regurgitant volume enters into a relatively normal left atrium that does not have years to develop the compliance seen in chronic mitral regurgitation 1,2. This results in a sudden increase in left atrial pressure and pulmonary venous pressures 1,2. Thus, acute pulmonary edema is a common manifestation in acute mitral regurgitation. Interestingly, because the reflux of blood through the mitral valve in acute mitral regurgitation preferentially moves rightwards posterosuperiorly, the pulmonary edema is often most noticeable in the upper and middle lobes of the right lung 3.EtiologyMitral regurgitation can be caused by damage to any of the mitral valve leaﬂets, the annulus, the chordae tendineae, the papillary muscles, and the subjacent myocardium 2. Thus, the causes of mitral regurgitation are protean and, as such, there is no single group of patients who are affected 1,2.Mitral regurgitation can be divided into acute and chronic forms, which have differing etiologies and imaging features 1,2. Furthermore, causes and mechanisms can be divided into primary causes (i.e. degenerative) or secondary causes (i.e. functional) 1,2.Causes and mechanisms include 1,2: acute mitral regurgitation  myocardial infarction with papillary muscle rupturethe anterolateral papillary muscle is supplied by both the left anterior descending artery (via a diagonal branch) and left circumflex artery (via an obtuse branch), while the posteromedial papillary muscle is only supplied by the posterior descending artery (which originates from the right coronary artery in most cases), hence most acute mitral regurgitation in myocardial infarcts occur due to posteromedial papillary muscle rupture in inferior myocardial infarcts   infective endocarditis chordae tendinae rupture seen in myxomatous degeneration (e.g. due to mitral valve prolapse, Marfan syndrome, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, etc.) prosthetic mitral valve dysfunction trauma   chronic mitral regurgitation annular calcification myxomatous degeneration (same underlying causes as in acute mitral regurgitation) previous infective/inflammatory illness rheumatic heart disease infective endocarditis connective tissue diseases    congenital valvular malformation (e.g. parachute mitral valve in the Shone complex) dilated cardiomyopathy hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy   Radiographic featuresPlain radiographTypical chest radiographic features of chronic mitral regurgitation include 4,5:  left atrial enlargement convexity or straightening of the left atrial appendage just below the main pulmonary artery (along left heart border)  double density sign: the right side of the enlarged left atrium pushes into the adjacent lung and creates an addition contour superimposed over the right heart elevation of the left main bronchus and splaying of the carina   walking man sign on lateral projections   upper zone venous enlargement due to pulmonary venous hypertension  left ventricular enlargement is also eventually present due to volume overload features of congestive heart failure may also be present In acute mitral regurgitation, pulmonary edema is often seen 3-5. Occasionally, it may be unilateral pulmonary edema, sometimes localized to the right upper lobe 3. In acute mitral regurgitation, radiographic signs of left atrial enlargement are often absent 5. Ultrasound: echocardiogramEchocardiography is useful for evaluating the cause of mitral regurgitation, for assessing the regurgitant volume, and for assessing the left ventricle 6. Various parameters are used in order to determine severity, such as 6: mild central jet has a width <20% of left atrial area, or <4 cm2  vena contracta <0.3 cm no or minimal flow convergence regurgitant volume <30 mL per beat regurgitant fraction <30% effective regurgitant orifice area <0.20 cm2    moderatemeasurements are worse than mild mitral regurgitation but do not meet criteria for severe mitral regurgitation  severe central jet has a width >40% of left atrial area and vena contracta ≥0.7 cm large flow convergence systolic reversal in pulmonary veins regurgitant volume ≥60 mL per beat regurgitant fraction ≥50% effective regurgitant orifice area ≥0.40 cm2    See also: Carpentier classification of mitral valve regurgitation. CT/MRICross-sectional imaging is rarely used to evaluate mitral regurgitation, however demonstrate the same radiographic features appreciated on plain film and echocardiography, but in greater detail 1,7. In particular, cardiac MRI (CMR) may be particularly useful for accurate measurements pertaining to the valve, regurgitant volume, and underlying etiology 1,7.Treatment and prognosisTreatment depends on the whether the mitral regurgitation is acute or chronic.Acute mitral regurgitationIf mitral regurgitation is acute and secondary to papillary rupture, the treatment of choice is mitral valve replacement 8. If there is concurrent hypotension (i.e. cardiogenic shock), an aortic-balloon pump can be used to increase organ perfusion and decrease the degree of mitral regurgitation 8. In normotensive patients, vasodilators help to decrease afterload 8.Chronic mitral regurgitationIn chronic mitral regurgitation, vasodilators are used to decrease afterload, e.g. ACE inhibitors 8-10. Hypertension is aggressively treated, antiarrhythmics are given where necessary and if there is concomitant mitral valve prolapse or atrial fibrillation, chronic anticoagulation is initiated 8-10.Complications congestive heart failure pulmonary hypertension mass-effect from left atrial enlargement (e.g. Ortner syndrome, dysphagia megalatriensis) atrial fibrillation sudden cardiac death from other arrhythmias tricuspid regurgitation Differential diagnosisThe main radiographic differential is that of mitral stenosis which also leads to enlargement of the left atrium. Unlike mitral regurgitation, mitral stenosis does not have left ventricular enlargement and usually has less striking enlargement of the left atrium 2. See also valvular heart disease mitral valve disease general mitral valve pathologies: mitral valve stenosis mitral valve regurgitation   specific mitral valve pathologies: congenital mitral valve stenosis cor triatriatum mitral annular calcification mitral valve atresia mitral valve prolapse parachute mitral valve   
__label__Cardiac Mitral valve stenosis is a valvulopathy that describes narrowing of the opening of the mitral valve between the left ventricle and the left atrium. On this page:  Article: Epidemiology Clinical presentation Pathology Radiographic features Treatment and prognosis See also References   Images:Cases and figures  EpidemiologyMitral stenosis is seen more commonly in women and in countries, generally developing nations, where rheumatic fever is common 1.Clinical presentationPatients with mitral stenosis characteristically present with progressive dyspnea that is precipitated by sudden changes in heart rate, volume status or cardiac output (e.g. physical exertion, fever, emotional stress, anemia, atrial fibrillation, pregnancy, etc.) 2,3. Clinical examination classically reveals a malar flush ('mitral facies') due to cutaneous vasoconstriction, and a mid-diastolic murmur that is heard on praecordial auscultation 2,3. Auscultation may also reveal an opening snap and a loud first heart sound 2,3.Patients may also manifest symptoms from complications of mitral stenosis, such as hemoptysis from pulmonary venous hypertension, or Ortner syndrome from mass-effect of the large left atrium, or those of heart failure 2,3. ECG  left atrial enlargementmay precipitate atrial fibrillation   right ventricular hypertrophyconcomitant left atrial enlargement without left ventricular hypertrophy is especially suggestive   PathologyMitral stenosis is usually acquired via rheumatic heart disease, where there is chronic inflammation of the mitral valve leaflets (mitral valvulitis) 2,3. This leads to progressive and diffuse fibrous thickening of the valve leaflets, and development of valvular calcifications 2,3. Eventually, the mitral commisures fuse and the chordae tendinae fuse 2,3. This culminates in significant immobilization and narrowing of the mitral valve, giving it a characteristic 'fish mouth' appearance 2-4. Many patients will also have concurrent mitral regurgitation due to the valve being unable to sufficiently close 2,3.The characteristic hemodynamic feature of mitral stenosis is an increased left atrial pressure 2,3. This increase in pressure is required as a compensatory mechanism for the stenosis, in order to maintain normal cardiac output 2,3. However, this compensation results in left atrial enlargement and an increase in pulmonary venous pressure 2,3. An increase in pulmonary venous pressure eventually leads to the development of pulmonary arterial hypertension, explaining why dyspnea and hemoptysis are such prominent and important symptoms in mitral stenosis 2,3. However, this adaptive mechanism eventually fails because as the left atrial pressure continues to increase as the stenosis worsens, the amount of time needed to fill the left ventricle with blood also increases 2,3. This can be compounded by atrial fibrillation, a complication of left atrial enlargement, which results in the loss of the 'atrial kick' at the end of diastole and an even greater left atrial pressure being needed 2,3.This becomes particularly problematic if there is an increase in heart rate (i.e. aforementioned precipitants), because the diastolic period shortens more than the systolic period 2,3. This means there is even less time to fill the left ventricle, often resulting in a sudden drop in cardiac output and development of acute pulmonary edema 2,3. EtiologyIn addition to being a sequela of rheumatic fever, which is the most common cause world-wide, there are numerous other causes 2-4:  mitral annular calcification with leaflet involvementan age-related cause  congenital mitral stenosis infective endocarditis cor triatriatum connective tissue disorders radiation-induced heart disease left atrial myxoma (generally not considered 'true' mitral stenosis) ball valve thrombus (generally not considered 'true' mitral stenosis) Radiographic featuresPlain radiographTypical chest radiographic features include 2,4-6:  left atrial enlargement convexity or straightening of the left atrial appendage just below the main pulmonary artery (along left heart border)  double density sign: the right side of the enlarged left atrium pushes into the adjacent lung and creates an addition contour superimposed over the right heart elevation of the left main bronchus and splaying of the carina   walking man sign on lateral projections   upper zone venous enlargement due to pulmonary venous hypertension pulmonary edema diffuse alveolar hemorrhage  secondary pulmonary hemosiderosis, often difficult to appreciate on a plain radiograph  pulmonary ossification, a late sign If the underlying etiology is mitral annular calcification, then this may also be appreciated on plain film.Ultrasound: echocardiographyEchocardiography is useful for assessing the mitral valve area, jet velocity, pressure gradients, and the left ventricle 2,7. Various parameters are used in order to determine severity, such as 2,7: mild valve area >1.5 cm2  mean gradient <5 mmHg pulmonary artery pressure <30 mmHg   moderate valve area 1.0-1.5 cm2  mean gradient 5-10 mmHg pulmonary artery pressure 30-50 mmHg   severe valve area <1.0 cm2  mean gradient >10 mmHg pulmonary artery pressure >50 mmHg   Additionally, the mitral valve anatomy can be assessed 7. One widely adopted echocardiographic scoring system for this is one that Wilkins et al. developed. In this system, four features of the mitral valve are identified, as follows 7: valve leaflet mobility valve leaflet thickening valve leaflet calcification subvalvular thickening CTCT confirms, with greater detail, findings on plain radiograph such as left atrial enlargement, features of heart failure, and secondary pulmonary hemosiderosis 4. Dynamic CT imagingRheumatic mitral stenosis may have distinctive morphological features on dynamic imaging 4. Restricted opening of the thickened valve from commissural fusion (especially with rheumatic valve disease), valve leaflet calcification, or both, results in a 'fish mouth' appearance on short-axis images 4. Bowing of a thickened and fibrotic anterior leaflet during diastole may result in a 'hockey-stick' appearance which is best seen on two- or four-chamber images 4.On the other hand, non-rheumatic causes of mitral stenosis usually produce nonspecific imaging features such as valve thickening or leaflet fixation 4.MRICardiac MRI (CMR) is able to provide the most detailed structural and dynamic assessment of the mitral valve and left-sided cardiac chambers 8-10.Cine MRIObservable features include 8-10: mitral leaflet thickening reduced diastolic opening abnormal valve motion toward the left ventricular outflow tract VEC-MRIVelocity-encoded cine-magnetic resonance imaging (VEC-MRI) is a relatively new method for quantitation of blood flow with the potential to measure high-velocity jets across stenotic valves 11.Treatment and prognosisThe decision to treat mitral stenosis is based on the severity and presence of complications. Management involves a combination of lifestyle and pharmacotherapy measures (a similar armamentarium to that used in heart failure and atrial fibrillation), and mitral valve surgery (e.g. mitral valvotomy or mitral valve replacement) 12. Additionally, patients with rheumatic mitral stenosis may need penicillin prophylaxis to prevent recurrence 12.Further details in regards to management is beyond the scope of this article.Complications congestive heart failure  pulmonary hypertension  mass-effect from left atrial enlargement (e.g. Ortner syndrome, dysphagia megalatriensis)  pulmonary embolus (often recurrent) pulmonary infections (e.g. pneumonia, bronchitis) atrial fibrillation sudden cardiac death from other arrhythmias thrmoboembolic ischemic stroke, including from calcified cerebral embolism if the cause is mitral annular calcification  mitral regurgitation tricuspid regurgitation See also valvular heart disease mitral valve disease general mitral valve pathologies: mitral valve stenosis mitral valve regurgitation   specific mitral valve pathologies: congenital mitral valve stenosis cor triatriatum mitral annular calcification mitral valve atresia mitral valve prolapse parachute mitral valve

__label__Central __label__Nervous __label__System __label__Paediatrics Möbius syndrome, also known as congenital facial diplegia syndrome, is a rare congenital condition characterized by the absence or underdevelopment of the abducens nerve (CN VI) and facial nerve (CN VII) nuclei. On this page:  Article: Epidemiology Clinical presentation Pathology Radiographic features Treatment and prognosis History and etymology References   Images:Cases and figures  EpidemiologyMöbius syndrome is rare with an estimated incidence of ~1 case per 100,000 births 4.Clinical presentationThe earliest sign is the inability of the newborn to suckle, with an expressionless face, and drooling. Paralysis may be unilateral or bilateral. As individuals grow older, the most conspicuous signs are an inability to close their mouths or smile. Inability to blink may lead to corneal abrasions.PathologyEtiology is multifactorial, and several theories have been proposed, with the most supported theory being of a transient ischemic or hypoxic insult to the fetus. Infectious and genetic etiologies have also been proposed.Additional brainstem involvement is also common and may include other cranial nerves as well as the musculoskeletal system. Grading schemes have been proposed which include additional manifestations (e.g. CLUFT (cranial nerve, lower limb, upper limb, face, and thorax)).AssociationsThe combination of Möbius syndrome and Poland syndrome has been well described (thus Poland-Möbius syndrome) 3.Radiographic featuresMRI brainMRI findings are those of brainstem hypoplasia (pons and medulla) with straightening of the floor of the fourth ventricle as a result of absence of the facial colliculus. Cerebellar hypoplasia, calcification of the pons in the region of the abducens nuclei and even absence of the middle cerebellar peduncles have been reported.Treatment and prognosisThe disease is not progressive.Various plastic surgery procedures can be performed to attempt to recover facial muscles function. For example, microvascular transfer of a gracilis muscle to the face. History and etymologyThe clinical syndrome was first described by Paul Julius Möbius (1853-1907): German neurologist.
__label__Cardiac The moderator band, also called the septomarginal trabecula, is a consistent structure in the morphologic right ventricle and can be helpful as a landmark in situations where the ventricles may be ambiguous (i.e. in some forms of congenital heart disease).The term "septomarginal" is descriptive since the muscle extends from the interventricular septum to the margin of the right ventricle, contacting/joining the base of the anterior papillary muscle.The moderator band does not attach to the tricuspid valve, but acts as part of the electrical conduction pathway of the heart (part of the right bundle branch). Blood supply typically originates from septal perforating branches of the left anterior descending artery (LAD) which may subsequently anastomose with vessels derived from the right coronary circulation. 
__label__Musculoskeletal __label__Spine Modic type endplate changes represent a classification for vertebral body endplate MRI signal, first described in 1988 1. It is widely recognized by radiologists and clinicians and is a useful shorthand for reporting MRIs of the spine.Recently Modic type I has received renewed attention due to the possibility of it representing low-grade indolent infection. It is thus discussed separately here.  Modic type I  T1: low signal  T2: high signal represents bone marrow edema and inflammation  T1+C: enhancement    Modic type II  T1: high signal  T2: iso to high signal represents normal red haemopoietic bone marrow conversion into yellow fatty marrow as a result of marrow ischemia    Modic type III  T1: low signal  T2: low signal represents subchondral bony sclerosis   History and etymologyMichael T Modic (fl. 2018) is an American neuroradiologist at the Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, Tennessee, in the US, although almost the whole of his career prior to 2018 was spent at the Cleveland Clinic 3.
__label__Musculoskeletal __label__Spine Modic type I endplate change is the most controversial and important of the three types described (see Modic endplate change).  It is seen on MRI of the spine and represents the presence of low T1 and high T2 signal within the bone marrow of a vertebral body adjacent to a disk. Type 1 change can enhance and be painful.Modic type I changes are seen much more frequently in patients with low back pain (46%) compared to asymptomatic general population (6%) 1. They are believed to be the result of fissuring of the endplates with the development of vascular granulation tissue adjacent to the endplates, resulting in bone marrow edema 2. This pattern is very similar to that seen in infection and merely represents bone marrow edema. Without correlation with clinical parameters (symptoms, fever, inflammatory markers) it can be difficult to distinguish sterile Modic type I change from diskitis/osteomyelitis. Highlighting this difficulty is the finding that a proportion of patients which what appears to be 'incidental' Modic type I change will go on to have proven diskitis osteomyelitis by low virulence pathogens such as Staphylococcus epidermidis, Propionibacterium acnes, and diphtheroid species over protracted follow-up (4.2% over 2 year follow-up in one study 3). More controversial is a 2013 study 4 which suggested that patients with isolated Modic I changes on imaging with only chronic lower back pain as a symptom (and no clinical or laboratory evidence of infection) responded clinically to protracted antibiotic administration with statistically significant improvement in disease-specific disability-RMDQ, leg pain and lumbar pain 4. The authors have coined the term Modic Antibiotic Spinal Therapy (MAST).A 2015 review 6 of the subject found moderate evidence supporting a causal relationship between the presence of bacteria and Modic I changes, as well as with lower back pain. The authors, however, state that further research is required.

__label__Gastrointestinal The modified CT severity index is an extension of the original CT severity index (CTSI) which was developed by Balthazar and colleagues in 1994 for distinguishing mild, moderate and severe forms of acute pancreatitis.The original CT severity index has been followed internationally and has been very useful. However, it has a number of limitations: it has been found that complications like organ failure, do not correlate well with the score given by original CTSI interobserver variability with original CTSI can result in different scores for the same patient it has been observed that patients with >30% necrosis have similar morbidity and mortality, thus including an additional 50% in the score was not practically useful These limitations have resulted in the creation of the modified CTSI which correlates more closely with patient outcome in terms of duration of hospital stay and development of organ failure.Modified CTSIScores are generated by estimating pancreatic inflammation and necrosis to give a score out of 10.Pancreatic inflammation 0: normal pancreas 2: intrinsic pancreatic abnormalities with or without inflammatory changes in peripancreatic fat 4: pancreatic or peripancreatic fluid collection or peripancreatic fat necrosis Pancreatic necrosis 0: none 2: 30% or less 4: more than 30% Extrapancreatic complications2: one or more of pleural effusion, ascites, vascular complications, parenchymal complications and/or gastrointestinal involvementTotal scoreTotal points are given out of 10 to determine the grade of pancreatitis and aid treatment: 0-2: mild 4-6: moderate 8-10: severe

__label__Chest The modified PIOPED II criteria for the diagnosis of pulmonary embolus indicate the presence or absence of pulmonary emboli based on findings on V/Q scan (ventilation-perfusion scintigraphy). The following article reflects the modified interpretation criteria promulgated in 2008 1 based on recategorized readings from the Prospective Investigation of Pulmonary Embolism Diagnosis II (PIOPED II), a trial in which patients underwent some combination of CT pulmonary angiography, V/Q scanning, and pulmonary digital subtraction angiography 2,3. These criteria supersede the revised PIOPED criteria and replace the multiple probabilistic categories with fewer categories of definitive interpretations 4, which may be more understandable for referring clinicians.Ventilation/perfusion modified PIOPED II criteriaThe interpretation of V/Q scans is based on detecting the presence of perfusion defects, identifying any matched ventilation defects, determining whether the perfusion defects are segmental or nonsegmental, and then evaluating the size of the segmental defect. The finding should be correlated with a chest radiograph.A large segmental defect covers >75% of a pulmonary segment. A moderate, subsegmental defect covers 25-75% of a pulmonary segment and is considered in the interpretative criteria equivalent to one-half of a large defect. A small, subsegmental defect covers <25% of a pulmonary segment.Pulmonary embolism present (high probability)two or more large mismatched segmental perfusion defects or the arithmetic equivalent of moderate and/or large defectsNondiagnostic (low or intermediate probability)all other findings not falling into the pulmonary embolism present or absent categoriesPulmonary embolism absent (normal or very low probability) no perfusion defects nonsegmental perfusion defects (e.g. pleural effusion at the costophrenic angle, cardiomegaly, elevated hemidiaphragm, hilar enlargement, linear atelectasis), without other perfusion defects in either lung perfusion defects smaller than corresponding chest radiographic opacity one to three small subsegmental perfusion defects two or more matched ventilation and perfusion defects with a regionally normal chest radiograph and some areas of normal perfusion elsewhere solitary triple matched defect (matched ventilation and perfusion defect with corresponding chest radiographic opacity) in a single segment in the middle or upper lung zone stripe sign (a stripe of perfusion peripheral to a defect, best seen on tangential view) large pleural effusion (occupying one-third or more of the pleural cavity), without other perfusion defects in either lung Perfusion-only modified PIOPED II criteriaThe modified PIOPED II criteria have been adapted for perfusion scintigraphy (i.e. no ventilation scan) 4,5. In this scheme, the presence of a match or mismatch is determined by comparing the perfusion scan with the chest radiograph rather than a ventilation scan. A perfusion defect without a corresponding radiographic opacity is considered mismatched. In addition, the criterion of multiple matched ventilation and perfusion defects with normal radiograph has been removed from the category of pulmonary embolism absent.Perfusion-only interpretation reduces both the specificity and the proportion of nondiagnostic readings compared to ventilation and perfusion using modified PIOPED II criteria 5.Pulmonary embolism present (high probability)two or more large mismatched segmental perfusion defects or the arithmetic equivalent of moderate and/or large defectsNondiagnostic (low or intermediate probability)all other findings not falling into the pulmonary embolism present or absent categoriesPulmonary embolism absent (normal or very low probability) no perfusion defects nonsegmental perfusion defects (e.g. pleural effusion at the costophrenic angle, cardiomegaly, elevated hemidiaphragm, hilar enlargement, linear atelectasis), without other perfusion defects in either lung perfusion defects smaller than corresponding chest radiographic opacity one to three small subsegmental perfusion defects solitary matched defect in a single segment in the middle or upper lung zone stripe sign (a stripe of perfusion peripheral to a defect, best seen on tangential view) large pleural effusion (occupying one-third or more of the pleural cavity), without other perfusion defects in either lung 
__label__Central __label__Nervous __label__System The modified Rankin scale is commonly used to quantify functional outcome in individuals who suffer a neurological event.

A modified Rankin score of 6 is often used to denote an individual who is deceased. Scale description  0: no symptoms/normal  1: no significant disability despite symptoms; able to carry out all usual duties and activities  2: slight disability; unable to carry out all previous activities, but able to look after own affairs without assistance  3: moderate disability; requiring some help, but able to walk without assistance  4: moderately severe disability; unable to walk without assistance and unable to attend to own bodily needs without assistance  5: severe disability; bedridden, incontinent and requiring constant nursing care and attention  6: dead 
__label__Central __label__Nervous __label__System The modified Ringertz grading system has historically been one of the more frequently used grading systems for diffuse astrocytomas, but has not essentially been replaced by the WHO grading system.Unlike the WHO grading system and St Anne-Mayo grading system (also known as the Dumas-Duport grading system) which divide astrocytomas into 4 grades, the Ringertz grading system only has 3 grades, and only applies to diffuse astrocytomas (i.e. not WHO grade 1 tumors such as pilocytic astrocytomas or subependymal giant cell astrocytomas) 1. As such there is a rough equivalence between WHO II - IV and modified Ringertz I - III, although there are some differences in the criteria required to fulfill various grades. The modified Ringertz grading system is as follows 2: grade 1 = astrocytoma roughly equivalent to WHO grade II mild hypercellularity mild nuclear atypia (nuclear enlargement, hyperchromasia, pleomorphism)  rare mitotic figures   grade 2 = anaplastic astrocytoma  roughly equivalent to WHO grade III more cellular than grade 2 more nuclear atypia  more mitotic figures endothelial proliferation (note this is a WHO grade IV feature)   grade 3 = glioblastoma roughly equivalent to WHO grade IV presence of geographic necrosis +/- surrounding pseudopalisading tumor cells   History and etymologyRingertz originally proposed the grading system in 1950 4. 
__label__Head __label__& __label__Neck The modified Stenvers view is an oblique radiographic projection used to demonstrate the petrous temporal bone, IAM and bony labyrinth. It is primarily used to assess electrode placement following the insertion of a cochlear implant. Specifically it assesses the: integrity, positioning, and depth of insertion of the electrodes 3  and is used as a baseline 1  The central beam is positioned 45 degrees with the plane of IR and 12 degrees cephalad. Performed as a PA projection, radiation to the orbits is minimized.The obliquity of the beam positions it in the plane of the superior semicircular canal. In a normally positioned cochlear implant (see images), the electrodes should be medial to the cochleostomy, which is approximated by a line drawn downward vertically through the superior semicircular canal 2.

__label__Central __label__Nervous __label__System Mollaret meningitis, also known as idiopathic recurrent meningitis, refers to a rare condition characterized by recurrent attacks of sudden aseptic meningitis with complete recovery followed by unpredictable recurrences 6. Presence of typical monocytes in CSF samples are helpful in diagnosis. On this page:  Article: Terminology Clinical presentation Pathology Radiographic features Treatment and prognosis History and etymology Differential diagnosis Related articles References   TerminologyMollaret’s meningitis refers only to idiopathic cases of recurrent aseptic meningitis. Some studies related HSV-2 as a possible cause and thus creating some terminology controversy. This article follows a logical thinking that knowing an etiological agent you do not have an idiopathic condition anymore, and so these cases should be referred to as recurrent viral meningitis 6. Clinical presentationPresentation is usually with fever, myalgia and arthralgia and signs and symptoms of meningism, including neck-stiffness, nausea and vomiting, photophobia, although these are variable 1,2.PathologyEtiologyThe condition by definition is idiopathic. See the discussion on terminology above. Microscopic appearanceThe increased cellularity of CSF is largely due to monocytes which have characteristic appearance and the tendency to aggregate into small groups 2. The cells are described as having "bean-shaped bilobed nuclei as well as multiple deep nuclear clefts depicting the so-called “footprint” appearance" 2. It was these cells that were initially described by Mollaret in 1944 2. Radiographic featuresAs is the case with other viral meningitis the role of imaging is limited. It is reasonable to obtain an MRI when patients are asymptomatic to ensure that no other abnormality is present which may be causing a recurrent chemical meningitis (e.g. intracranial epidermoid cyst 4 or neurenteric cyst 5) which have been reported as causing clinical presentation indistinguishable from HSV-2 and from Mollaret's meningitis. Treatment and prognosisAlthough each attack is self limited, given the strong association with HSV-2 therapy and prophylaxis with acyclovir or valacyclovir has been proposed 2. History and etymologyThe French neurologist and epidemiologist Pierre Mollaret (1898-1987) first reported a series of patients with "recurrent benign endothelioleukocytic aseptic meningitis" in 1944 7,8. He is also known for describing the anatomical connections of the Guillain-Mollaret triangle.Differential diagnosisRecurrent aseptic meningitis should raise the suspicion for: Mollaret's meningitis dermoid cyst epidermoid cyst HSV2 meningitis 
__label__Paediatrics __label__Central __label__Nervous __label__System Molybdenum cofactor deficiency (MCD or MOCD) is a very rare, lethal, genetic condition caused by a loss of function of molybdenum-dependent enzymes, manifesting as severe and rapid neurological deterioration. On imaging it mimics hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy. On this page:  Article: Epidemiology Clinical presentation Pathology Radiographic features History and etymology References   EpidemiologyLess than 150 reports of this condition are found in the medical literature 1. It is inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion 1,2. On average, diagnosis is made by one year, and only ~50% of the published cases survived 36 months 1.Clinical presentationIt usually presents within a few days of birth, typically with seizures, motor neurological deficits, microcephaly, and developmental delay.PathologyMolybdenum is an essential trace element, forming part of a molybdenum cofactor,  which is vital for the normal functioning of several enzymes, including sulfite oxidase and xanthine dehydrogenase. In molybdenum cofactor deficiency, the activity of these enzymes is reduced. The genes MOCS1, MOCS2, MOCS3, and GEPH encode critical components for the synthesis of molybdenum cofactor, and it is mutation of these genes that leads to the condition, most commonly MOCS1.As a result there is a steep elevation in intracerebral sulfites with deleterious consequences for cellular metabolism and secondary toxic neurological sequelae.Radiographic featuresThe features on MRI are very similar to those of hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy 1,2.History and etymologyFirst description of this disease was in 1978 2.

The exact pathogenesis of Mönckeberg sclerosis is unknown, but it is more common with advancing age, diabetes and chronic renal disease.
__label__Head __label__& __label__Neck Mondini malformation is a historical term used to describe an incomplete partition type II anomaly with large vestibular aqueduct. On this page:  Article: Terminology Clinical presentation Pathology Radiographic features Treatment and prognosis History and etymology Related articles References   Images:Cases and figures  TerminologyThe term is often used inappropriately to describe any cochlear abnormality, rather than a specific type of cochlear hypoplasia. Thus, most would favor not using the term, except perhaps in cases where the findings exactly match those described by Mondini.If any doubt it is best to just describe the anatomical abnormalities.Clinical presentationPatients have sensorineural hearing loss, which is usually bilateral. As the basal turn of the cochlea is intact, high-frequency hearing is generally preserved.PathologyThe abnormality is thought to result from a relatively late insult during the 7th week of embryological development when most of the inner ear has already formed. Earlier insults result in more severe abnormalities (Michel deformity, cochlear aplasia and cochlear hypoplasia).See classification of congenital cochlear anomalies.There are only 1.5 turns to the cochlea instead of the expected 2.5. The interscalar septum between the middle and apical segments also fails to form leading to a confluent, sac-like cochlea.AssociationsMondini dysplasia has been associated with thalidomide and rubella embryopathies as well as a number of syndromes:  Pendred syndrome: bilateral sensorineural hearing loss and goiter 3,5   CHARGE syndrome 4   Klippel-Feil syndrome 5   DiGeorge syndrome 5   Wildervanck syndrome 5  Some publications have suggested a link between Mondini malformation and spontaneous CSF fistulae and meningitis; however, this appears to be only the case with more severe forms of cochlear hypoplasia, and not with a true isolated Mondini malformation 1,4.Radiographic featuresThe Mondini abnormality consists of a triad 1: abnormal cochlea only 1.5 turns (instead of the normal 2.5 turns) normal basal turn with a cystic apex in place of the distal 1.5 turns   enlarged vestibule with normal semicircular canals   enlarged vestibular aqueduct containing a dilated endolymphatic sac  Additionally, complete or partial absence of the normal interscalar septum is also present, which can now be demonstrated on high-field MRI 4.Treatment and prognosisHearing can be improved by implantation of a multichannel cochlear implant 6.ComplicationsThere is an increased risk of: meningitis perilymphatic fistula History and etymologyIt was first described in Latin by Carlo Mondini (1729-1803), an Italian anatomist, in 1791 1,2.
__label__Urogenital __label__Breast Mondor disease is a rare benign breast condition characterized by thrombophlebitis of the subcutaneous veins of the breast and anterior chest wall. It can also occur in the dorsal veins of the penis. On this page:  Article: Epidemiology Clinical presentation Pathology Radiographic features Treatment and prognosis History and etymology References   Images:Cases and figures  EpidemiologyAlthough Mondor disease is rarely reported in the literature, this is likely in part due to lack of awareness of the entity. It tends to dominate in women between 30-60 years.Incidence rates of 0.5-0.8% have been reported, however, it reflects only the symptomatic population.Clinical presentationPatients usually present with a painful breast (cord-like) mass. There may be overlying skin erythema. It may be accentuated when the ipsilateral arm is raised.PathologyThe pathogenesis includes the formation of venous thrombosis with total or partial occlusion and vascular recanalization causing fibromuscular hyperplasia of the vessel wall and infiltration plus fibrosis of surrounding subcutaneous cellular tissue. The thrombotic vessel can adhere to the superjacent skin causing retraction and formation of characteristic cordiform grooves secondary to local fibroblastic proliferation.The vessels most commonly involved are the thoracoepigastric, lateral thoracic vein and superior epigastric veins.AssociationsIn most patients, the condition is idiopathic 4. Recognized associations include: trauma, preceding thoracic or breast surgical procedures, ultrasound-guided or stereotactic biopsies previous central venous catheters hypercoagulable states dehydration although an association with breast cancer (~12% 2) has been reported, the veracity of this claim is difficult to confirm due to the over-representation of patients being investigated for other breast lesions in reported cases 1  Location - distributionMost commonly affects the thoraco-epigastric and/or lateral thoracic veins towards the upper outer quadrant. The upper inner quadrants of the breasts are almost never involved 6.Radiographic featuresMammographyTypically, Mondor disease appears as superficially located tubular beaded density corresponding to a palpable rope-like mass. Mammography can be normal in a significant proportion of cases.UltrasoundOn ultrasound, Mondor disease appears as a tubular anechoic or isoechoic structure with multiple areas of narrowing, giving a beaded appearance. Sometimes low-level internal echoes may be present representing clot. The surrounding soft tissues may be hyperechoic due to associated inflammatory response.No flow is present on color or spectral Doppler studies and in some situations, an abrupt cut off with the normal vessel may be seen.Treatment and prognosisIt is a benign self-limiting condition, and the natural history is for the thrombosed vein to recanalize and for clinical symptoms to resolve gradually (~ 6 weeks). Anti-inflammatory medications are sometimes given for symptomatic relief. Otherwise, management is supportive, and anticoagulants, antibiotics or surgical intervention is not indicated due to thrombophlebitis subsiding spontaneously and without complications, or persistent deformity. A close interval follow-up scan is usually recommended to ensure resolution and to exclude any other entity.History and etymologyIn the year 1869, Faage was the first one who described this condition. Further characterization of this condition by the French surgeon Henry Mondor in 1939, hence the name.

MGUS prevalence increases with advancing age 6.Clinical presentationThe condition is asymptomatic.Diagnostic criteriaThe criteria for MGUS diagnosis according to the International Myeloma Working Group include 1: serum M-protein <3 g/dL clonal plasma cell population present in the bone marrow (<10% cellularity) absence of end-organ damage (e.g. hypercalcemia, renal insufficiency, lytic lesions, anemia) PathologyGenetic changes including hyperdiploidy, IgH translocations, and cyclin D gene dysregulation seem to be important in the transition from a normal plasma cell to a pre-malignant plasma cell such as that found in MGUS or smoldering myeloma 2. Clonal expansion of a single pre-malignant plasma occurs which produces excess paraprotein of one of the immunoglobulin types (e.g. IgG, IgM). However, further changes are needed to transition into a myeloma cell 2.Ninety-percent of multiple myeloma patients are seen to have been in an MGUS phase before transitioning into multiple myeloma 5. Factors that predict an increased risk of multiple myeloma progression from MGUS include non-IgM MGUS and paraprotein levels over 1.5 g/dL 2.Radiographic featuresPlain radiograph and CTOsteoporosis and vertebral fractures are more common in MGUS patients than in healthy controls 3.MRIMRI is not indicated in the initial workup of MGUS patients unless there is an increased suspicion of multiple myeloma progression 4.MGUS patients usually will have a normal-appearing bone marrow:  T1: hyperintense  T2: hypointense However, focal lesions that may represent infiltration by monoclonal plasma cells may be present and these patients have an increased risk of transforming into multiple myeloma 4. Treatment and prognosisMGUS patients are generally under surveillance with regular repeat blood tests and imaging. 20% of MGUS patients will progress to multiple myeloma, amyloidosis, or a lymphoproliferative disorder within 25 years, with up to 1% of patients with MGUS transitioning into multiple myeloma per year 7,8.Complications multiple myeloma progression  Waldenström macroglobulinemia progression History and etymologyThe condition now known as MGUS was first described by the Swedish physician Jan Walderström (1906-1996) in 1961 and termed "essential benign hypergammaglobulinemia" 2.

__label__Musculoskeletal __label__Trauma __label__Paediatrics Monteggia fracture-dislocations consist of a fracture of the ulnar shaft with concomitant dislocation of the radial head. The ulnar fracture is usually obvious, whereas the radial head dislocation can be overlooked, with potentially serious functional and medico-legal ramifications.  On this page:  Article: Mechanism Epidemiology Radiographic features Treatment and prognosis History and etymology See also Related articles References   Images:Cases and figures  MechanismTypically, Monteggia fracture-dislocations occur as the result of a fall onto an outstretched hand (FOOSH) 4.The Bado classification is used to subdivide the fracture-dislocation into four types which all have different treatment options and prognoses and is based on the principle that the direction in which the apex of the ulnar fracture points is the same direction as the radial head dislocation 3. The direction of radial head dislocation depends on whether abduction or adduction forces were applied during the fall 1.As is usually the case, in everyday practice, describing the fracture-dislocation is far more important than remembering the grade.EpidemiologyMonteggia fractures occur mostly in children (peak incidence at ages 4-10 years) and rarely in adults.Radiographic featuresWhen a forearm fracture is identified, dedicated imaging of both the elbow and the wrist is important and good quality AP and lateral views are essential. Provided that films of adequate quality are obtained, the ulnar fracture is usually obvious and the radial head dislocation should be readily identifiable.Regarding pediatric patients, one should take into account the age-dependent normal appearance of the elbow centers of ossification, which could mimic a fracture to the inexperienced eye that up to 24% of cases are associated with a distal radial fracture that an apparently isolated ulnar plastic/greenstick fracture may actually represent a Monteggia-equivalent lesion with spontaneous radial head reduction Treatment and prognosisAll four types of Monteggia fracture-dislocations (see Bado classification) are treated with open reduction and internal fixation of the ulna and radius in type 4. Usually anatomical reduction of the ulna allows for a closed reduction of the radial head.  Types I, III, IV are cast at 110 degrees of flexion, whereas type II is cast at 70 degrees of flexion 4,6.In the pediatric population, treatment depends on the type of ulnar fracture: 7,8  bowing/greenstick fracture: closed reduction of the ulnar bow and casting. If reduction of the radial head is not possible open osteotomy and fixation of the  ulna may be required.  complete transverse/short oblique fracture: closed reduction and intramedullary fixation  long oblique/comminuted fracture: open reduction and internal fixation The prognosis is significantly decreased by delayed diagnosis and treatment.  History and etymologyIt is named after Giovanni Battista Monteggia, Italian surgeon (1762-1815), who first described what is now known as the Bado type I fracture in 1814 5-6.See also eponymous fractures radial head dislocation Galeazzi and Monteggia fracture-dislocations (mnemonic)

The cingulate gyrus is everted into narrowed and elongated frontal horns.An alternative name is the viking helmet sign. Other names include steer-horn, Texas longhorn, buffalo horn, trident-shaped, and Poseidon ventricles 4.
__label__Chest The more black sign is a normal finding in lateral chest x-ray, and refers to the gradual increased apparent radiolucency (blackness) of the vertebral bodies, when proceeding from upper to lower chest. This is due to the increased proportion of the chest comprised of air containing lungs over distal dorsal spine compared to the upper parts. When the air is displaced by higher attenuation material, such as consolidation, fluid or a mass (e.g. bronchogenic carcinoma, paraspinal neurogenic tumor) then the lower thoracic vertebral bodies become more radiodense; this is referred to as the loss of the more black sign and is also known as the spine sign. 
__label__Musculoskeletal __label__Trauma Morel-Lavallée lesions are closed degloving injuries associated with severe trauma which then present as hemolymphatic masses. MRI and ultrasound are useful modalities for evaluation. On this page:  Article: Terminology Pathology Radiographic features Treatment and prognosis History and etymology Differential diagnosis References   Images:Cases and figures  TerminologyThe lesions classically occur over the greater trochanter of the femur 1. Morel-Lavallée lesions, strictly speaking, occur in the thigh. However, similar biomechanical forces to the lumbar region, over the scapula, or over the knee 13 can result in identical lesions and these are often also called Morel-Lavallée lesions  1,3.PathologyMorel-Lavallée lesions typically occur when the skin and subcutaneous fatty tissue traumatically and abruptly separate from the underlying fascia.The initial injury represents a shearing of subcutaneous tissues away from underlying fascia. The initial potential space created superficial to the fascia is filled by various types of fluid, ranging from serous fluid to frank blood.The collection may then spontaneously resolve or become encapsulated and persistent.ClassificationSome authors have suggested a classification system mainly based on MR assessment 12. Mellado-Bencardino classificationRadiographic featuresThe size of these lesions is variable, ranging from small thin slivers of fluid to thickly encapsulated lesions many centimeters in diameter. When chronic they are typically oval or fusiform in shape and adherent to the underlying fascia.Plain radiographThe Morel-Lavellée lesion will not be demonstrated on a plain radiograph but an underlying fracture may be present. Injuries which are associated with these lesions include femoral and pelvic fractures.UltrasoundTypically these lesions are anechoic or hypoechoic. As with a standard hematoma, it can be predominantly echogenic in the acute phase, becoming more hypoechoic as blood products liquefy over time 11. Internal debris, including fat globules can give rise to echogenic foci or even fluid-fluid levels 1. A capsule of variable thickness may be seen.MRIMRI is able to clearly determine the relationship of the collection with the underlying fascia. The fluid is of variable signal intensity depending on makeup and may even show a fluid-fluid level 1.Treatment and prognosisOnce these lesions become established and encapsulated then conservative management is rarely successful (e.g. compression bandages). Surgical drainage may be sufficient, although in some instances the capsule needs to be resected to prevent re-accumulation.History and etymologyIt was first described in 1848 by Victor-Auguste-François Morel-Lavallée (1811-1865), a French surgeon 4. Differential diagnosisIf in a classic location and with a characteristic appearance then little differential exists. In cases where the lesion is heterogeneous in morphology or fluid-fluid levels are present, the possibilities include 1,2: hemangioma sarcoma fat necrosis subcutaneous hematoma

__label__Central __label__Nervous __label__System Morning glory sign of progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) and multisystem atrophy, not to be confused with morning glory syndrome, refers to the appearance of the midbrain on axial imaging 1.Graphically this is identified on an axial image at the level of the midbrain by drawing 1:   a horizontal line drawn through the edge of the posterior cerebral aqueduct a second line is drawn along the lateral margin of the tegmentum from the intersection of the horizontal line to the "pit" between the tegmentum and the cerebral peduncle In normal subjects the lateral margin of the tegmentum is convex and runs outside of this second line. However, in patients with progressive supranuclear palsy and multisystem atrophy with vertical supranuclear gaze-palsy the tegmentum is concave and the lateral margin runs inside the second line. The morphology of the midbrain in patients with vertical supranuclear gaze-palsy resembles the morning glory flower thus termed the morning glory sign as originally described by Adachi et al 1.

__label__Musculoskeletal Morton neuromas, also known as interdigital or intermetatarsal neuromas, are focal areas of symptomatic perineural fibrosis around a plantar digital nerve of the foot. The condition is thought to be due to chronic entrapment of the nerve by the intermetatarsal ligament. On this page:  Article: Terminology Epidemiology Clinical presentation Pathology Radiographic features Treatment and prognosis History and etymology Differential diagnosis References   Images: Cases and figures Imaging differential diagnosis   TerminologyThe term neuroma is a misnomer because the abnormality is non-neoplastic and does not represent a true neuroma. It may more correctly be known as Morton metatarsalgia. EpidemiologyIt most often occurs in middle-aged individuals and is many times more common in women than men. Approximately 30% of asymptomatic middle-aged persons have the radiologic-pathologic findings of a Morton neuroma. Clinical presentationPatients typically present with forefoot pain which radiates from midfoot to toes 5. Symptoms are often progressive and worsened by activity. The Mulder sign is a physical sign associated with Morton neuroma, which may be elicited while the patient is in a supine position. The pain associated with the neuroma, as well as a click, can be reproduced by squeezing the two metatarsal heads together with one hand, while concomitantly putting pressure on the interdigital space with the other hand.A number of other clinical tests for Morton neuroma have been described, all of which have high specificity and aim to either reproduce symptoms of pain or paraesthesia. These include 15: thumb-index finger squeeze: squeeze the symptomatic intermetatarsal space between the index (dorsal) and thumb (plantar) surfaces foot squeeze test: compression of metatarsal heads between fingers and thumb plantar and dorsal percussion tests: percussion of the dorsal and plantar intermetatarsal spaces with a finger light touch sensory test: stroking the tip of the affected toe produces sensation different to the adjacent toes PathologyIt is characterized by neural degeneration with epineural and endoneural vascular hyalinisation, and perineural fibrosis around a plantar digital nerve 2.LocationThe 3rd web-space (between 3rd and 4th metatarsal heads) is the most commonly affected site. The 2nd web-space is less often involved while the remaining web-spaces are rarely involved. 10% of lesions are bilateral.Occasionally specific terms are used when occurring certain spaces 13 1st intermetatarsal space: Heuter neuroma 4th intermetatarsal space: Iselin neuroma Radiographic featuresSymptomatic lesions tend to be slightly larger (mean 5.3 mm vs. 4.1 mm in one large series 1). Lesions >5 mm are very likely to be symptomatic. UltrasoundTypically seen as a round to ovoid, well-defined, hypoechoic lesion in the intermetatarsal space proximal to the metatarsal head 4. A Morton neuroma is not compressible.

__label__Musculoskeletal __label__Chest The evocative appearance of a mosaic is used for two different entities: mosaic attenuation of the lungs mosaic pattern of Paget disease of the bone 
__label__Chest Mosaic attenuation is a descriptive term used in describing a patchwork of regions of differing pulmonary attenuation on CT imaging.  It is a non-specific finding, although is associated with the following:  obstructive small airways disease: low attenuation regions are abnormal and reflect decreased perfusion of the poorly ventilated regions, e.g. bronchiectasis, cystic fibrosis, constrictive bronchiolitis    occlusive vascular disease (can be termed a mosaic perfusion pattern in this setting 7): low attenuation regions are abnormal and reflect relative oligaemia, e.g. chronic pulmonary embolism, chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension   parenchymal disease: considered most common cause of mosaic attenuation; high attenuation regions are abnormal and represent ground-glass opacity  The term is best used where the differentiation between mosaic perfusion, mosaic oligaemia, and ground-glass opacity cannot be confidently made.Differentiating the causeAlthough "mosaic attenuation" is non-specific, a radiologist should search for ancillary imaging findings which may help identify the underlying process in order to help guide clinical management.Ascertaining the underlying cause for mosaic attenuation is often possible on the basis of clinical information, combined with the assessment of other lung features on HRCT 2,5:  peripheral vessels: if vessels in hypoattenuated regions of the lung are smaller than in the other regions, the pattern is due to mosaic perfusion (i.e. airways or vascular disease rather than ground-glass)  central vessels: pulmonary hypertension, reflected as dilatation of the central pulmonary arteries, suggests a vascular cause  small airways: the presence of abnormally dilated or thick walled airways in the relatively lucent lung confirms underlying airway disease, see small airways disease   parenchymal changes: ground glass opacity is the likely cause for mosaic attenuation if other features of the infiltrative disease are present, such as reticular opacities (i.e. crazy paving pattern) or nodules  air trapping: refers to regions of the lung which following expiration do not show the normal increase in attenuation, or show little change in cross-sectional area 5 (i.e. this is an expiratory HRCT finding); the presence of air trapping suggests airway disease

__label__Central __label__Nervous __label__System The mother in law sign is perhaps uncharitably (depends on the mother in law I suppose) used to describe lesions that enhance early during the arterial phase and remain opacified well after the venous phase. The joke is that a mother in law comes early and stays late. It is most frequently equated with the angiographic appearance of a meningioma. 
__label__Central __label__Nervous __label__System The motor band sign is a radiological sign described in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).It refers to the appearance of the cortex on axial GRE and SWI MRI in patients with ALS 1,2. On these sequences, and in the axial plane, curvilinear bands of low signal may be appreciated within the cortical gray matter, almost exclusively along the primary motor cortex (i.e. 'motor bands' of low signal) 1,2. Although this pattern of low signal is usually seen bilaterally, it has been reported to also occur unilaterally 2. Occasionally, T2/FLAIR sequences may also demonstrate the same low signal 1-4.This sign is produced because of iron accumulation within microglia in the motor cortex 1. The mechanisms for this have not been fully elucidated, however it has been postulated that perhaps microglia accumulate this iron as they phagocytose degenerating neurons from the primary motor cortex 1.It is important to note that this radiological sign is not specific for ALS 1-4. Indeed, low T2/FLAIR/GRE/SWI signal in the precentral gyrus has been well-documented to also occur in patients with other neurological disorders (e.g. Parkinson disease, Alzheimer disease) and even in many normal adults as an age-related phenomenon 1-4. This might possibly be due to the fact that the motor cortex has the highest cortical concentration of iron 1.

__label__Chest Mounier-Kuhn syndrome is a somewhat controversial entity and used synonymously with tracheobronchomegaly by most authors 7-9.  On this page:  Article: Epidemiology Clinical presentation Pathology Radiographic features Treatment and prognosis History and etymology Differential diagnosis References   Images:Cases and figures  EpidemiologyMounier-Kuhn syndrome is most frequently seen in middle-aged men before the age of 50 years 1,6.Clinical presentationThe anatomical and physiological changes present in the airways predispose to stagnation within enlarged portions of the bronchial tree. Therefore, chronic productive cough or recurrent pulmonary infections are commonplace 1,2. Clinical features may mimic and often co-exist with COPD 4.It is unclear whether Mounier-Kuhn syndrome is a distinct entity or whether it is simply tracheobronchomegaly in the setting of some underlying primary abnormalities. If the latter definition is used, associations include connective tissue disorders such as 2,6: Ehlers-Danlos syndrome cutis laxa PathologyThe underlying abnormality is an absence or marked atrophy of the elastic fibers and smooth muscle within the wall of the trachea and main bronchi. Although this is thought to be congenital, there is no universal agreement. As a result of the flaccidity of the wall of the respiratory tree, there is a significant change in airway size during the different phases of respiration. During inspiration, negative intra-thoracic pressure develops leading to marked enlargement of the trachea. However, as expiration commences, the reversed intra-thoracic pressure causes collapse. In addition to this dynamic change, bronchial or tracheal diverticulosis are common, as is bronchiectasis 2. There is also an absence of the myenteric plexus of the bronchial tree 2.Radiographic featuresThe most sensitive imaging test is a biphasic CT with images of the trachea obtained during inspiration and expiration. Two-phase chest radiographs will also demonstrate the enlargement of the trachea on inspiration and collapse during expiration, but they are clearly less sensitive.To consider the diagnosis, the diameter of the trachea should be greater than 3 cm: this is usually measured 2 cm above the aortic arch 1,2. Other measurements that have been used to make the diagnosis include bronchial diameters of 20 or 24 mm (right), and 15 or 23 mm (left) 2,4. Posteriorly, projecting tracheal diverticula may also be seen.Treatment and prognosisTreatment is usually conservative with physiotherapy and postural drainage. Acute exacerbations are treated with antibiotics. In rare instances, tracheal stenting has been used 4.History and etymologyIt was initially described by Pierre-Louis Mounier-Kuhn, a French physician, in 1932 3-5.Differential diagnosisThe differential is that of a dilated trachea. 
__label__Central __label__Nervous __label__System Mount Fuji sign is seen on cross-sectional imaging and is indicative of a tension pneumocephalus. The sign refers to the presence of gas (pneumocephalus) between the tips of the frontal lobes with a heaped-up appearance giving the silhouette-like appearance of Mount Fuji 1-3. It suggests that the pressure of the gas is at least greater than that of the surface tension of cerebrospinal fluid between the frontal lobes 1-3.  The sign is caused by cortical veins tethering the frontal lobes, resulting in their striking appearance 5. The appearance of this sign often warrants immediate surgery to prevent permanent neurological damage. However, conservative management in patients with no signs of raised intracranial pressure has also been described 4.See alsopneumocephalus
__label__Musculoskeletal The glenohumeral joint is highly mobile resulting in a wide range of movements of the arm. Arm flexionArm flexion represents rotation in the anatomic plane such that the distal humerus moves ventrally.

In adduction internal rotation can be up to 70°. As the arm is abducted this increases towards 95°. subscapularis latissimus dorsi teres major  deltoid (anterior fibers) Arm external rotationExternal (lateral) rotation describes external rotation of the humeral around its longitudinal axis. As with medial (internal) rotation, the degree of rotation is dependent on the degree of abduction. When the arm is adducted, medial rotation of 40-55° is possible. However, as the arm is abducted, this increases towards 70°. infraspinatus teres minor  deltoid (posterior fibers) CircumductionCircumduction is the orderly combination of shoulder flexion, abduction, extension and abduction (or the reverse) to trace a cone with the arm. It is hence produced by co-ordination of all the muscles that produce these individual movements but also relies on other joints of the pectoral girdle such and the acromioclavicular joint and scapulothoracic joint.

__label__Spine Movements of the spine are possible due to intervertebral discs, and with the fulcrum of movement occurring primarily around the nucleus pulposus. Specialized motion occurs at the atlanto-occipital and atlantoaxial joints, which do not contain a disc.The spine (vertebral column) forms the central axis of the skeleton, supports the skull, and gives attachment to the thoracic cage, pectoral girdle, and upper limb. It combines strength with great flexibility as it has many joints close together.Flexion and extension are common to all parts of the spine; a significant degree of flexion/extension can be achieved at the atlanto-occipital joint, cervical and lumbar spine, but is restricted in the thoracic spine. Lateral flexion is free at the atlanto-occipital joint, cervical and lumbar spine, but less free in the thoracic spine.

For a list of conditions that can mimic moyamoya please refer to the article on moyamoya syndrome, or the differential diagnosis list at the end of the article. EpidemiologyMoyamoya is a disease of children and young people, with a bi-modal age distribution 6: early childhood: peak ~4 years of age (two-thirds) middle age: 30-40 years of age (one-third) The condition was initially described in Japanese patients, where it is still most common, in which 7-10% of cases are familial.Clinical presentationPresentation is to some degree age dependent. In children, hemispheric ischemic strokes are most pronounced, whereas in adults hemorrhage from the abnormal vessels is more common 6. Watershed infarcts are also very commonly identified. PathologyThe underlying pathological and genetic basis for moyamoya disease is not well understood 10. Fibrocellular proliferation and thickening of the intima is the main process responsible for vascular stenosis and occlusion. The associated neo-vascularization may be a compensatory mechanism or part of the disease process itself, with the moyamoya vessels demonstrating various histopathological abnormalities including fibrin deposition, microaneurysm formation, among other abnormalities 10.Radiographic featuresGeneralMoyamoya disease affects the bilateral distal ICA and circle of Willis. Up to 18% of patients with moyamoya may present with unilateral angiography-documented disease 8.Small abnormal net-like vessels proliferate giving the characteristic "puff of smoke" appearance on direct angiography. CTA and MRA are not always able to demonstrate this appearance on account of lower flow and spatial resolution. Although classically described affecting the ICA, over 50% of patients also have involvement of the posterior cerebral arteries. Generalized cerebral atrophy is a common finding. Watershed infarcts are also commonly seen.Collateral circulation forms from a number of sources: via the abnormal moyamoya vessels: lenticulostriate, thalamoperforating, leptomeningeal, and dural arteries appear as multiple tortuous flow voids on T1 and T2 weighted sequences pial collaterals from less affected vessels (especially PCA): forming the so-called ivy sign (high serpentine sulcal FLAIR signal intensity due to slow flow and also a high signal on T1 postcontrast-enhanced MRI) 3  multiple foci of microbleeds and also prominent deep medullary veins "brush sign" on susceptibility sequences 7  transdural branches of the middle meningeal and other dural branches MRIIn addition to demonstrating the aforementioned arterial stenoses (best seen on MRA) or enlarged perforators (best seen on T2 weighted images), vessel wall imaging can also be helpful, particularly in distinguishing moyamoya disease from moyamoya syndrome from atherosclerotic or vasculitic/inflammatory causes 11. Vessel wall imaging in moyamoya disease typically demonstrates 11:   concentric luminal narrowing none or only minimal enhancement homogeneous T2 signal no outward remodelling (outer wall area of the stenotic segment greater than proximal normal segment; seen in atherosclerosis)  StagingSee: moyamoya staging (Suzuki)Treatment and prognosisBypassing the occlusive segments is the aim of most surgical therapy and this can be accomplished by direct (i.e. direct artery-to-artery anastomosis) or indirect revascularization.In adults, external carotid artery to middle cerebral artery (ECA-MCA) anastomoses can be performed as the vessels are larger. One of the surgical options is the superficial temporal artery to middle cerebral artery (STA-MCA) bypass. A variety of indirect revascularization techniques have been developed, and are generally preferred in pediatric patients as their vessels are too small to allow direct anastomosis. These include 12:  encephalomyosynangiosis (EMS) encephaloduroarteriosynangiosis (EDAS) encephaloduroarteriomyosynangiosis (EDAMS) An alternative is to create multiple burrholes to allow formations of local collaterals 9. History and etymologyThe term moyamoya comes from a Japanese expression for something "hazy just like a puff of cigarette smoke drifting in the air" and was first described by Suzuki and Takaku in 1969 1.Differential diagnosisA number of conditions can lead to imaging appearances that are very similar to moyamoya disease. For a full list, please refer to moyamoya syndrome: cranial radiotherapy atherosclerosis  phakomatoses  neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) tuberous sclerosis   infection tuberculous meningitis bacterial leptomeningitis post-varicella vasculitis    CNS vasculitides  connective tissue disorderssystemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)  hematological disorders sickle cell disease antiphospholipid syndrome aplastic anemia

__label__Musculoskeletal __label__Interventional An MR arthrogram solution is a dilute solution of gadolinium that is used in MR arthrography for injection into the joint prior to imaging. The joint injection is performed under fluoroscopic guidance.In vitro studies suggest that the ideal gadolinium concentration is ~2 to 2.5 mmol/L, however, most commercial preparations have a concentration of 0.5 mol/L (500 mmol/L). Therefore, a large volume of normal saline is required to dilute the gadolinium down about 200 times 4.  As is the case with many such procedures, many recipes are described and many heated arguments arise between various factions. A simple approach to preparing 20 mL of solution is as follows: 10 mL normal saline 0.1 mL gadolinium (use a tuberculum syringe to measure this) 10 mL non-ionic iodinated contrast Adding local anesthetic to the mixture can be done to relieve joint pain due to capsular distension, although even then pain may remain for 24 to 48 hours after injection. The amount of this mixture actually injected used will, obviously, depend on the size of the joint.Other preparations include: 5 mL solution made up of 0.1 mL gadolinium, 3.5 mL non-ionic iodinated contrast, and 1.5 mL local anesthetic 2.5 mL solution of 0.1 mL gadolinium and 2.5 mL non-ionic iodinated contrast for wrist, elbow and ankle injections Alternatively, intra-articular location can be confirmed with iodinated contrast injected immediately after needle placement, from a separate syringe. The advantage of this approach is that if you are not in the joint, then you won't have contaminated T1 weighted scans with extra-articular gadolinium. The downside is that in small joints, care should be taken not to fill the joint with iodinated contrast, impairing subsequent installation of gadolinium containing contrast. Regardless of mixture and number of syringes, it is important to ensure the solution contains no gas bubbles as these may be confused with intra-articular loose bodies.Choice of local anestheticMany local anesthetics have been shown to be chondrotoxic at typical therapeutic doses and are thus best avoided (e.g. lidocaine) or used at low concentrations 5,6. Of all routinely available anesthetics, ropivacaine at concentrations of 0.5% appears safest 5. 
__label__Gastrointestinal __label__Urogenital __label__Gynaecology MR defecating proctography is a dynamic study for evaluation of the pelvic floor and pelvic organ prolapse.PhasesThere are four phases of evaluation: rest squeeze strain (Valsalva) defecation/evacuation Method of evaluationMany variations in the techniques described below exist.Patient preparationTypically there is no specific patient preparation required. SequencesAxial, coronal and sagittal T2W sequences of the pelvis are acquired to assess for structural abnormalities of the pelvic viscera and musculature. The dynamic study is carried out by acquiring cine images in the sagittal plane with a steady state sequence. This is similar to the sequence used for cardiac imaging. The dynamic sequences are acquired during squeezing, straining and evacuation. Prior to the evacuation sequence, 100-150 mL of ultrasound gel is instilled per rectum. Ultrasound gel is used as it is easy to acquire, manipulate into syringes, and is clearly seen on the cine sequences.MeasurementsAfter the acquisition of the appropriate images, the following lines are drawn and measurements are taken for evaluation and assessment of the outcome of this study.  pubococcygeal line: a line joining the inferior aspect of the pubic symphysis to the last coccygeal joint H line: corresponds to the AP diameter of the hiatus M line: is the perpendicular distance between the pubococcygeal line and the posterior anorectal junction These measurements should be used cautiously in men since they are not validated 4.Abnormalities to assess rectal descent bladder base descent (cystocele) vaginal vault descent rectocele intussusception

__label__Spine __label__Musculoskeletal Disc degeneration can be graded on MRI T2 spin-echo weighted images using a grading system proposed by Pfirrmann 1. This classification is not used on routine spine reports, being more important for research purposes.  grade I: disc is homogeneous with bright hyperintense white signal intensity and normal disc height  grade II disc is inhomogeneous, but keeping the hyperintense white signal nucleus and annulus are clearly differentiated, and a gray horizontal band could be present disc height is normal    grade III disc is inhomogeneous with an intermittent gray signal intensity distinction between nucleus and annulus is unclear disc height is normal or slightly decreased    grade IV disc is inhomogeneous with a hypointense dark gray signal intensity there is no more distinction between the nucleus and annulus disc height is slightly or moderately decreased    grade V disc is inhomogeneous with a hypointense black signal intensity there is no more difference between the nucleus and annulus the disc space is collapsed   A modified classification was proposed in 2007 by Griffith et al. 2.
__label__Musculoskeletal MRI grading system for bone stress injuries​ is a useful tool in assessing the extent of clinical findings related to bone stress injury and predicting the time to return to full activity, the latter being especially important for athletes. ClassificationsFredericson grading systemFredericson et al. created an MRI grading system initially developed to grade medial tibial stress injuries but has since been applied elsewhere 1,4:  grade 1: periosteal edema with no associated bone marrow abnormalities  grade 2: periosteal edema with mild bone marrow edema visible only on fat-suppressed T2WI  grade 3: periosteal edema and extensive bone marrow edema visible on T1 and fat-suppressed T2WI  grade 4   grade 4a: periosteal edema, extensive bone marrow edema visible on T1WI and fat-suppressed T2WI and multiple focal areas of intracortical signal changes  grade 4b: periosteal edema, extensive bone marrow edema visible on T1WI and fat-suppressed T2WI and linear region of intracortical signal change (i.e. a fracture line)   Arendt grading systemArendt et al. assessed bone stress injuries in athletes at different skeletal sites and modified the Fredericson grading system, adding STIR sequence to the assessment 2:  grade 1: positive marrow signal change on STIR  grade 2: positive marrow signal change on STIR and T2WI  grade 3: positive marrow signal change on STIR, T2WI and T1WI, no definite cortical break  grade 4: grade 3 findings plus visible fracture line on T1WI or T2WI In contrast to Fredericson grading system, the absence or presence of periosteal reaction does not affect the injury grade. The estimated time of treatment (rest) required to return to sports activity based on this classification is 5: grade 1: 3 weeks grade 2: 3-6 weeks grade 3: 12-16 weeks grade 4: 16+ weeks Nattiv grading systemNattiv et al. assessed bone stress injuries in athletes at different skeletal sites and combined the criteria of the above two grading systems. As a result, both bone marrow edema and periosteal reaction affect injury grade 3: grade 1: mild marrow edema on fat-suppressed T2WI (but not on T1WI) or periosteal edema grade 2: moderate marrow edema on fat-suppressed T2WI (but not on T1WI) or periosteal edema grade 3: severe marrow edema on both fat-suppressed T2WI and T1WI or periosteal edema, without a fracture line grade 4: severe marrow edema on both fat-suppressed T2WI and T1WI or periosteal edema plus visible fracture line on T1WI or T2WI Practical pointsDue to the presence of several grading systems, the radiological report may be unclear if only an injury grade is given, without any further details. For this reason, it is advisable to: talk to the orthopedic surgeons at the institution to reach a consensus regarding the used grading system report the findings in a descriptive manner, adding in brackets the grade and the author of a grading system (e.g. Arendt grade 3 bone stress injury)

__label__Oncology MRI protocols are a combination of various MRI sequences, designed to optimally assess a particular region of the body and/or pathological process.There are some general principles of protocol design for each area. However, the specifics of a protocol are dependent on MRI hardware and software, radiologist's and referrer's preference, patient factors (e.g. allergy) and time constraints.The implementation of a protocols has 3 chief purposes: maximizing diagnostic quality delivery of consistency in scan quality efficient and effective radiology service delivery It is also good practice to review departmental or institutional protocols on a regular basis.

__label__Gynaecology __label__Oncology MRI reporting guidelines for cervical cancer help maintain uniformity of reports and assessment of important imaging staging criteria.Tumor sizeThe tumor should be measured in three orthogonal planes. Tumors with a maximum diameter >4 cm are usually not amenable to primary radical surgery.Parametrial invasionThe parametrium is the anatomical space lateral to the cervix. The reported accuracy of MRI in detecting parametrial invasion varies in the literature from 76 to 92% 2.MRI does however have a high negative predictive value in excluding parametrial invasion. If the T2 hypointense cervical ring is intact, then parametrial invasion is unlikely.Vaginal invasionReplacement of the usual hypointense vaginal wall with hyperintense tumor: invasion of the upper 2/3 of the vagina: stage IIa invasion of the lower 1/3 of the vagina: stage IIIa Pelvic sidewall involvement or hydronephrosisExtension to the pelvic sidewall and or hydronephrosis (unless due to another cause) is consistent with IIIb disease.Bladder and rectal invasionMRI has a high negative predictive value at excluding bladder and rectal involvement.Bladder involvement can be seen on MRI as thickening of the posterior bladder wall and disruption of the hypointense bladder musculature or a mass within the bladder.Rectal involvement is less common and can be seen as loss of posterior fat planes and direct tumor extension.See alsoCervical cancer staging
__label__Interventional __label__Oncology __label__Urogenital MRI targeted prostate biopsy refers to an imaging targeted technique rather than the traditional systematic approach of a prostate biopsy after respective imaging with multiparametric MRI (mpMRI) of the prostate.As a consequence of the recent advances of multiparametric MRI (mpMRI) of the prostate in the detection and characterization of prostate cancer 1,2, three different targeted MRI-guided biopsy techniques have been established and are in use 3: cognitive fusion biopsy, ultrasound-MRI fusion biopsy and MRI-guided in-bore biopsy 3,8-10.MRI-targeted prostate biopsy (all three different targeted techniques included) has been shown to detect more clinically significant prostate cancer and less clinically insignificant cancer when compared with systematic biopsies, requiring fewer cores 4-7.IndicationsThere is a consensus about the strategy of repeat biopsy with image-guided targeting in patients with an initial negative biopsy and PI-RADS assessment category of 3-5 after multiparametric MRI (mpMRI) of the prostate 3.An advantage of the MR-imaging targeted approach in patients with a clinical suspicion of prostate cancer who have not undergone a prior biopsy of the prostate over an initial systematic biopsy has been suggested 4-6.ContraindicationsContraindications are basically the same as with a systematic prostate biopsy and include uncooperative behavior by the patient and uncorrectable bleeding disorders. Depending on the technique used other contraindications may apply, e.g. claustrophobia or MR incompatible implants or devices.Preprocedural evaluationAntibacterial prophylaxis.Coagulation parameters and platelet count depending on instutional protocol should be obtained and reviewed for safe procedure.Data or images of a previous multiparametric MRI (mpMRI) of the prostate should be reviewed and used for planning the procedure.MRI-targeted biopsy techniquesCognitive fusion biopsyA suspicious lesion is identified on mpMRI prior to biopsy and then targeted using transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) guidance by the physician conducting the respective cognitive fusion biopsy (usually a urologist or less often radiologist).The exact location of the lesion may be demonstrated on a diagram, snapshot or on a mpMRI image file. Original mpMR images should be reviewed immediately prior to the biopsy.Advantages short intervention time and can be done in a urology clinic setting can be easily combined with systematic biopsy Disadvantages least accurate of the above mentioned targeted biopsy methods lack of standardization, no accurate biopsy and target location documentation operator dependent MRI in-bore biopsyThis is conducted in the MRI scanner under direct MR image guidance with direct visualization of the MR imaging target and the needle.It can be undertaken with an endorectal approach or with a transperineal approach.The endorectal approach is usually performed with the patient in the prone position. The biopsy device contains a transrectal needle guide, which is used as a fiducial reference point.The transperineal approach is usually performed with the patient in the supine position and the biopsy is generally performed with a guidance grid.Both MRI-targeted in-bore biopsy techniques usually utilize planning software for target localization and to achieve a more accurate needle placement.Advantages high contrast resolution, improved targeting, accurate biopsy and target location documentation 9,10  seems to be most accurate in the detection of clinically significant cancer 11  potentially fewer cores and thus less risk of complications Disadvantages long intervention time, no real-time feedback requires MRI scanner time and MR compatible equipment very high costs 9,10  Transrectal ultrasound-MR imaging fusion biopsyLesion detection capabilities of multiparametric MR imaging (mpMRI)  and the real-time capabilities of transrectal ultrasound are synergized. Previously acquired MR images are registered and fused with real-time transrectal ultrasound images , which allows tracking of the ultrasound biopsy probe.The lesions shown at multiparametric MR images can be targeted under ultrasound guidance outside the MRI gantry, and thus allowing a much faster intervention. Different ultrasound probes and tracking mechanisms exist 9.Advantages good biopsy and target location documentation possible faster intervention time than MR in-bore biopsy 9,10  can be easily done in conjunction with systematic biopsy Disadvantages and challenges special registration and fusion software and hardware necessary, high initial costs 9,10  registration errors/misalignment steep learning curve, requires good cooperation between urologist, radiologist and pathologist Postprocedural careDoes not differ from postprocedural care of a systematic biopsy of the prostate.Recovery time depending on local anesthetic used.Observation until urination in order to timely pick up urinary retention.The patient should be informed about light urinary and/or rectal bleeding and heamtospermia.ComplicationsComplications are not different from systematic prostate biopsy and include hematuria and hematospermia, rectal bleeding, rarely urinary retention or infection (prostatic abscess and/or sepsis). Though it has been suggested that they occur less often because of the lesser number of biopsy cores required 4.See also:Prostate biopsy
__label__Haematology __label__Hepatobiliary MR liver iron quantification is a non-invasive means of measuring liver iron concentration, a key indicator in the management of patients with hemochromatosis (primary or secondary).AdvantagesApart from being non-invasive, sampling occurs in a large cross-section of the liver, as opposed to a biopsy, which typically represents 1/50,000 of the whole liver. The acquisition for both methods described below is usually short and usually takes up 10 minutes of magnet time only.PhysicsThere are two principle methods of liver iron quantification by MRI: T2 relaxometry and signal intensity ratio. T2 relaxometryIron within liver has paramagnetic properties and results in a decrease in T2 relaxation times. The accelerated relaxation is proportional to iron content. Decay models are attributed to the average signal intensity at different echo times. To obtain reliable measurements of T2 times at different levels of iron overload, acquisition sequences with several different echo times are needed. Signal intensity as a function of echo time can be used to obtain a T2 parametric map 1.Signal intensity ratio (SIR)The ratio between the signal intensity of the liver and the signal intensity of paraspinal muscle that does not accumulate iron can be used to determine liver iron concentration. Using the same slice, signal intensity measurements are performed using ROIs, avoiding large vessels in the liver. The sequences used are gradient recalled echoes, as these are more sensitive to the paramagnetic effect of iron. One of the most recognized SIR methods was developed at the University of Rennes, France 2.T2 relaxometry vs. SIR methodsEstimating liver iron content is easier to perform with SIR compared with T2 relaxometry. SIR methods are less accurate at an iron concentration of >350 micromol Fe/g. However, SIR methods are highly specific at all levels of iron concentration and are reproducible. Overall, T2 relaxation methods are more accurate, but not yet standardized, and normally require off-site processing, which attracts additional cost. An advantage of T2 relaxation methods is the utility of myocardial iron concentration measurement 3.
__label__Central __label__Nervous __label__System Perfusion weighted imaging is a term used to denote a variety of MRI techniques able to give insights into the perfusion of tissues by blood. There are three techniques in wide use to derive one or more perfusion values:  ​techniques ​dynamic susceptibility contrast (DSC) MR perfusion  dynamic contrast enhanced (DCE) MR perfusion arterial spin labeling  (ASL) MR perfusion   derived values time to peak (TTP) mean transit time (MTT) cerebral blood volume (CBV) cerebral blood flow (CBF) negative enhancement integral (NEI) k-trans   The main role of perfusion imaging is in evaluation of ischemic conditions (e.g. acute cerebral infarction to determine ischemic penumbra, moya-moya disease to identify vascular reserve), neoplasms (e.g. identify highest grade component of diffuse astrocytomas, help distinguish glioblastomas from cerebral metastases) and neurodegenerative diseases. 
__label__Central __label__Nervous __label__System The technique of magnetic resonance spectroscopy (usually shortened to MR spectroscopy or MRS) allows tissue to be interrogated for the presence and concentration of various metabolites. Grossman and Yousem said "If you need this to help you, go back to page 1; everything except Canavan (disease) has low NAA, high choline" 1. This is perhaps a little harsh, however, it is fair to say that MRS often does not add a great deal to an overall MR study but does increase specificity, and may help in improving our ability to predict histological grade. On this page:  Article: Physics Related pathology Mnemonic History and etymology Related articles References   Images:Cases and figures  PhysicsThe basic principle that enables MR spectroscopy (MRS) is that the distribution of electrons within an atom cause nuclei in different molecules to experience a slightly different magnetic field. This results in slightly different resonant frequencies, which in turn return a slightly different signal. The technique is identical to that of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) as used in analytical chemistry, but the community commonly refers to in vivo NMR as MRS to avoid confusion (and, arguably, the word "nuclear").MR spectra can be acquired from any "NMR-active" nucleus, which is a nucleus possessing non-zero spin: protons, carbon-13 and phosphorus-31 are the most commonly encountered, and in clinical practice essentially only proton spectra (which enable the resolution of metabolite profiles in vivo) are encountered. Phosphorus-31 (P-31) is typically used to look at the ratio of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to phosphocreatine and other metabolites, and can be used to assess the energy charge of the cell. If raw signal was processed then the spectra would be dominated by water, which would make all other spectra invisible. Water suppression is therefore part of any MRS sequence, either via inversion recovery or chemical shift selective (CHESS) techniques. If water suppression is not successful then a general slope to the baseline can be demonstrated, changing the relative heights of peaks.Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) is performed with a variety of pulse sequences. The simplest sequence consists of a 90 degree radiofrequency (RF) pulse, without any gradients, with reception of the signal by the RF coil immediately after the single RF pulse.Many sequences used for imaging can be used for spectroscopy also (such as the spin echo sequence). The important difference between an imaging sequence and a spectroscopy sequence is that for spectroscopy, a read-out gradient is not used during the time the RF coil is receiving the signal from the person or object being examined. Instead of using the frequency information (provided by the read-out or frequency gradient) to provide spatial or positional information, the frequency information is used to identify different chemical compounds. This is possible because the electron cloud surrounding different chemical compounds shields the resonant atoms of spectroscopic interest to varying degrees depending on the specific compound and the specific position in the compound. This electron shielding causes the observed resonance frequency of the atoms to slightly different and therefore identifiable with MRS.Peaks​ It is the Time of Echo (TE) that conditions the number of measurable metabolites: long TE (136-272 ms) vs short TE (10-50 ms) 7-8.  lactate: resonates at 1.33 ppm  lipids: resonates at 1.3 ppm  alanine: resonates at 1.48 ppm  N-acetylaspartate (NAA): resonates at 2.0 ppm  glutamine/glutamate: resonates at 2.2-2.4 ppm   GABA: resonates at 2.2-2.4 ppm  2-hydroxyglutarate: resonates at 2.25 ppm 6   citrate: resonates 2.6 ppm   creatine: resonates at 3.0 ppm  choline: resonates at 3.2 ppm  myo-inositol: resonates at 3.5 ppm water resonates at 4.7 ppm Less common peaks  propylene glycol: resonates at 1.14 ppm ethanol: resonates at 1.16 ppm acetate: resonates at 1.9 ppm acetone: resonates at 2.22 ppm acetoacetate: resonates at 2.29 ppm succinate: resonates at 2.4 ppm methylsulfonylmethane: resonates at 3.15 ppm  scyllo-inositol: resonates at 3.36 ppm taurine: resonates at 3.4 ppm glucose: resonates at 3.43 ppm and 3.8 ppm mannitol: resonates at 3.78 ppm lactate quartet: resonates at 4.11 ppm NB: ppm = parts per millionRelated pathologyGliomaMRS can help increase our ability to predict grade. As the grade increases, NAA and creatine decrease and choline, lipids and lactate increase. In the setting of gliomas, choline will be elevated beyond the margins of contrast enhancement in keeping with cellular infiltration.Non-glial tumors May be difficult but in general non-glial tumors will have little, if any, NAA peak. Radiation effects Distinguishing radiation change and tumor recurrence can be problematic. In recurrent tumor choline will be elevated, whereas in radiation change, NAA, choline and creatine will all be low.Ischemia and infarction Lactate will increase as the brain switches to anaerobic metabolism. When infarction takes place then lipids are released and peaks appear.Infection As in all processes which destroy normal brain tissue, NAA is absent. Within bacterial abscess cavities, lactate, alanine, cytosolic acid and acetate are elevated/present.Of note choline is low or absent in toxoplasmosis, whereas it is elevated in lymphoma, helping to distinguish the two.White matter diseases  progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) may demonstrate elevated myoinositol  Canavan disease characteristically demonstrates elevated NAA Hepatic encephalopathy Markedly reduced myoinositol, and to a lesser degree choline.

__label__Urogenital MR spectroscopy is a promising development in the radiological evaluation of possible prostate malignancy. The MR spectroscopic evaluation is mainly based on the choline peak elevation and choline-creatinine ratios.Choline/creatine to citrate ratios: > 0.5: suspicious > 0.8: very suspicious > 2: abnormal Additionally, the peak heights of citrate and choline can be compared visually2.The addition of MR spectroscopic data to the conventional MRI has improved detection of prostate cancer and has also improved tumor volume detection, and staging capabilities of MRI.Endorectal coils are considered superior to the body coils in the evaluation of prostate and periprostatic tissue imaging. With improving hardware and field strengths of MRI the surface array coils can also be used effectively in evaluating prostate.The spectroscopic data can be superimposed on anatomical images and color tumor maps can be obtained to depict the true tumor volume, this can be done in all three planes. Volumetric depiction is also possible.
__label__Central __label__Nervous __label__System MR vessel wall imaging refers to MRI techniques used to evaluate for disease within the walls of arteries, beyond the luminal abnormalities depicted on angiographic imaging. This can be used anywhere in the body but is particularly important intracranially in distinguishing between various causes of luminal stenosis such as intracranial atherosclerotic disease (ICAD) versus vasculitis.  On this page:  Article: Technique Clinical uses and interpretation Pitfalls References   TechniqueVessel wall MRI requires high spatial and contrast resolution to depict thin arterial walls discrete from their surrounding tissues. Several techniques to achieve this resolution are applied to sequences weighted towards various tissue contrasts (T1-weighted images before and after contrast medium most commonly, T2-weighted images, or proton density-weighted images) 1-4.Spatial resolutionFirst, due to the small size of the target vessels, high spatial resolution is imperative. Higher field strength (3.0 T rather than 1.5 T) is preferred due to the improved signal-to-noise ratio and acquisition times when selecting smaller voxel dimensions. For intracranial imaging at 3 T, a 3D acquisition with isotropic voxel sizes in the 0.4-0.7 mm range is commonly used 1. If 2D sequences are used, because of the poor spatial resolution in the slice-select direction (at least 2 mm slice thickness), multiplanar imaging is required to optimally depict vessels in both short and long axes 1.Contrast resolutionSecond, the signal from blood must be kept low to distinguish the vessel wall from the lumen. These so-called black/dark blood techniques usually exploit the fact that blood flows while vessel walls remain stationary. Turbo/fast spin-echo sequences intrinsically have low arterial blood signal (flow voids) due to time of flight effects (spins move out of the imaged slice before the 180° refocusing pulse) and/or intravoxel dephasing (spins moving with different velocities due to turbulent or laminar flow acquire different phases) 1. Both mechanisms contribute when 2D techniques are employed but only the latter is important in 3D techniques in which a large slab is imaged at once.The most commonly used 3D sequences for intracranial vessel wall imaging use turbo/fast spin-echo with variable low refocusing flip angles, which maintain high spatial resolution during long echo trains. These sequences are known by brand names such as SPACE, Cube, and VISTA 1,2. Other methods of blood suppression are available 1,4: spatial presaturation (saturation band): in 2D techniques, the spins that start in a slab adjacent to the imaged slice can be selectively dephased with a spoiling gradient and cannot regain signal when they flow into the imaged slice  double inversion recovery: a non-selective inversion pulse with a TI near the null point of blood followed by a slice selective inversion pulse recovers signal in stationary tissue but not in flowing blood delay alternating with nutation for tailored excitation (DANTE) 6  Finally, to depict the vessel wall discretely, signal must also be suppressed from the surrounding tissue. For vessel wall imaging of the extracranial head and neck, for instance, this means suppressing fat signal. For intracranial vessel wall imaging, this means suppressing CSF signal. Fortunately, because CSF flows, many techniques used to suppress signal from flowing blood also suppress CSF signal. Depending on the contrast weighting (CSF signal is low on T1-weighted images but not T2- or proton density-weighted images), dedicated methods to suppress CSF may be needed, such as inversion recovery, antidriven equilibrium, or DANTE 5,6,11.Correlative luminal imagingVessel wall imaging is usually performed in addition to a bright blood MRA sequence, such as the gradient echo-based time of flight MRA, to assess the lumen caliber and localize abnormalities for further vessel wall assessment.Clinical uses and interpretationSeveral indications exist, in varying stages of clinical versus research application: intracranial arterial steno-occlusive diseases: distinguish between common causes of stenosis and/or identify potentially symptomatic lesions without significant stenosis due to remodelling 1  atherosclerotic plaque: eccentric wall thickening, often heterogeneously enhancing  vasculitis: concentric wall thickening and homogeneous enhancement  reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome (RCVS): non-enhancing or minimally enhancing wall thickening  arterial dissection: intimal flap on T2-weighted images, intramural hematoma on T1-weighted images  moyamoya disease: non-enhancing intracranial carotid stenosis    intracranial saccular aneurysms: lack of wall enhancement predicts aneurysm stability 13   giant cell (temporal) arteritis: site selection for temporal artery biopsy and predicting results of temporal artery biopsy 7-9  extracranial carotid artery atherosclerotic plaque: detect features associated with high risk for ischemic events, such as thin/ruptured fibrous cap, large lipid-rich necrotic core, or intraplaque hemorrhage 12  PitfallsSeveral common interpretive pitfalls exist 1: slow flow: in laminar flow or intra-aneurysmal circulation, slower blood flow adjacent to the vessel wall may have incompletely suppressed signal, mimicking wall thickening and enhancement; it is helpful to correlate with lumen caliber on MRA or the precontrast medium vessel wall sequence veins: enhancing veins, which have slower flow, mimic arteries with wall enhancement; it is helpful to correlate with time-of-flight MRA to distinguish arteries and veins vasa vasorum: the extracranial carotid and vertebral arteries and sometimes proximal intracranial arteries as well (especially in elderly with severe atherosclerosis), are supplied by the vasa vasorum that appears as diffuse smooth concentric enhancement, which mimics wall enhancement from vasculitis; the distribution and clinical picture helps distinguish

On this page:  Article: Epidemiology Clinical presentation Pathology Radiographic features Treatment and prognosis  Related articles References   Images:Cases and figures  EpidemiologyThe peak incidence is in the 6th and 7th decades 1,3. Associations with other colonic neoplasia and chronic ulcerative colitis have been reported 1. Clinical presentationSymptoms are much more likely to manifest than in the other more indolent appendiceal neoplasms (e.g. adenoma or neuroendocrine tumors). The spectrum of symptoms varies from vague abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and weight loss, to a palpable mass, abdominal distension, and acute appendicitis 1,3.PathologyConsiderable controversy still exists on mucinous neoplasms of the appendix pathologic classification and nomenclature 1. According to a panel of specialist review in 2016, a new nomenclature and classification for the appendiceal mucinous neoplasms based on their histologic type and biologic behavior has been proposed and since then the term mucinous adenocarcinoma should be reserved for the mucinous tumors that have an infiltrative invasion beyond the muscularis mucosa 1,2. An adenocarcinoma is defined as mucinous when extracellular mucin corresponds to more than 50% of the lesion. The signet ring cell carcinoma variant occurs when a tumor has more than 50% of cells showing the classical signet ring morphology 1,2.  Radiographic featuresFluoroscopyBarium enema Nonspecific signs may indicate a tumoral lesion adjacent to the cecum, including the non-filling of the appendix, a submucosal mass lesion at the cecal pole, and an extraluminal compression of the cecum 1. Treatment and prognosis Staging and management of these are different from those of colorectal carcinoma, please refer to the appendiceal mucinous neoplasms TNM staging for further details. 
__label__Breast Mucinous carcinoma of the breast, also known as colloid breast carcinoma, is a subtype of invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC). They account for about ~ 2% (range 1-7% 4) of breast cancers.  On this page:  Article: Epidemiology Clinical presentation Pathology Radiographic features Treatment and prognosis Related articles References   Images:Cases and figures  EpidemiologyIt tends to occur in older women where a prevalence of as much as 7% is found among women 75 years or older, whereas the prevalence is only 1% in women younger than 35 years 4. Clinical presentationIf palpable, they tend to manifest as soft masses.PathologyAt pathological examination, the dominant feature is the presence of mucin within and surrounding cancer cells. The mucin to cell ratio can vary from lesion to lesion. A core biopsy specimen usually gives a gelatinous appearance. Microscopically, it is formed by large mucin lakes surrounded by mucus-producing cancer cells.Histologically it is divided into two broad types:  hypocellular type A or pure mucinous breast cancer: entire tumor consists of well-differentiated carcinoma cells with excessive extracellular mucin surrounding them. The growth pattern is often expanding, cellularity and mitotic activity are low, and cell atypia is not very prominent. The margin of the tumor is usually well demarcated  hypercellular type B or mixed mucinous breast cancer: tumor also contains variable areas of DIC-NOS component. They are devoid of extracellular mucin. This type is more likely to be infiltrative and carries much worse prognosis Radiographic featuresMajority of well-marginated breast masses are benign but approximately 10–20% of breast malignancies also could be well-circumscribed such as mucinous tumors; others include papillary, medullary, and metaplastic carcinomas as well as malignant phyllodes tumors. Because of different patterns of mammogram and ultrasound, both should be performed in all cases of MCB and in some equivocal cases breast MRI is of great value. MammographyThe presence of mucin results in a low-density and relatively well-defined lobular mass. Sometimes they may have partly faded or obscure margins. Up to 20% of lesions can be occult on mammography 4. Calcification can be rare in pure mucinous types.UltrasoundAt ultrasound, mucinous carcinomas often display mixed echogenicity with mixed solid and cystic components. Posterior acoustic enhancement is common. As times the lesion can be isoechoic to breast tissue on ultrasound which can make diagnosis difficult 3.Sonographically, mixed cystic and solid components, distal enhancement, and microlobulated margins are commonly found in mucinous carcinomas. Homogeneity on sonography is associated with the pure type of MCB, in which margins are usually well defined, and the tumor is iso-echogenic relative to the fat surrounding the breast tissue on ultrasound. A mixed MCB tends to be more hypoechoic.Breast MRIOn MRI, they are one of the few cancers that have very high signal intensity on T2-weighted images 2 which relates to the water component in mucin. When compared with other malignant breast tumors, they show lower signal intensity on DWI and increased ADC values. On postcontrast images, benign-appearing kinetics with gradual and persistent enhancement is typical and so they can be easily mistaken for a benign lesion.PET/CTPET/CT may help to differentiate pure from mixed mucinous carcinoma and to evaluate the aggressiveness of the tumor.Treatment and prognosisA pure mucinous subtype carries a relatively good prognosis compared to other adenocarcinomas: 5-year survival 95% (stage 2), 75% (stage 3), 35% (stage 4). Overall the tendency to metastasize is less than for other types of cancer (e.g. invasive ductal carcinoma not otherwise specified). Mixed MCB has a more aggressive behavior.

Its external surface is often smooth, and it is composed of unilocular or multilocular large (>2-4 cm) cysts with a thicker wall 5.CTOn CT, they tend to appear as round to ovoid, externally smooth, near-water-density cystic lesions. Amorphous calcifications, septations and solid excrescences may be seen. Both mucinous cystadenomas and cystadenocarcinomas do not have central scars.MRISignal characteristics of the cyst(s) can vary dependent on content. Mucin components exhibit high signal on T1 while calcific components are low signal on both T1 and T2 10. Pure cystic components show low signal on T1 and high signal on T2.Treatment and prognosisWhile surgical resection is the standard mode of treatment, even the overtly malignant mucinous cystadenocarcinomas carry a far better prognosis than solid ductal adenocarcinomas 1.Differential diagnosisOn ultrasound or CT consider serous cystadenoma of the pancreas: can sometimes be indistinguishable on imaging 3 See also cystic lesions of the pancreas mucinous cystic neoplasms of the pancreas

In these case, the peritoneal histology is considered more important for prognostication 3.Radiographic featuresOn imaging, they are difficult to be distinguished from each other, particularly when comparing the low- and high-grade appendiceal mucinous neoplasms, and generally are referred to as a "mucinous neoplasm of the appendix". Treatment and prognosisManagement varies depending both on the type of appendiceal tumor and (often more importantly) on the histology and extent of peritoneal disease. Surgical approaches, particularly for newer categories of disease (e.g. HAMN) remain under investigation 3.In general, premalignant mucinous appendiceal tumors are treated by surgical resection. Indeterminate-behavior lesions such as LAMN are often followed with surveillance imaging after resection. Adenocarcinoma is generally treated with right hemicolectomy and nodal dissection, due to improved survival compared to appendectomy alone 3.Patients with peritoneal disease (i.e. pseudomyxoma peritonei) may be treated by cytoreductive surgery with hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC), particularly if peritoneal disease is low-grade 3.

It is classified under the group of lung carcinomas of the salivary gland type. On this page:  Article: Epidemiology Pathology Clinical presentation Radiographic features Treatment and prognosis Related articles References   Images:Cases and figures  EpidemiologyMucoepidermoid carcinoma (MEC) is the most common of the SGTTLs 9. The tumor is thought to account for ~ 0.1-0.2% of primary lung cancers 4. MEC may be encountered in any age group, however, most cases have been seen in adults 4. There appears to be slight male preponderance with a male-to-female distribution of almost 1.5:1 9.PathologyLesions typically occur in relation to the tracheobronchial tree (hence they are also termed muco-epidermoid carcinomas of the tracheobronchial tree). In larger series, no topographic predilection for any particular pulmonary lobe or segment has been discovered. Central location often leads to postobstructive mucoid and lipoid pneumonia 9.Gross pathologyCommon presentation of this uncommon tumors may be as exophytic endobronchial tumor, potentially greater than 5 cm in greatest diameter. Usually well circumscribed and with smooth overlying mucosal surfaces, their cut sections are tan-gray or yellow.HistopathologyMay be solid, cystic or both, may show overtly mucoid features. Components comprise clear cells, squamoid cells or transitional polygonal cells, interspersed with areas containing mucus-secreting glandular cells.They are divided into low- and high-grade lesions: low-grade tumors characteristically demonstrate bland cytologic features; mitotic activity is minimal or absent high-grade mucoepidermoid carcinoma demonstrates a greater degree of cytologic anaplasia in both its squamoid and glandular elements; areas of necrosis and hemorrhage may also be present Differentials on biopsy low-grade MEC may resemble mucous gland adenoma (MGA), especially in small biopsies distinction between these two entities may be impossible without complete resection of the tumor   high-grade MEC: distinction from NSCLC may be largely academic usually based on the absence of foci of conventional adenocarcinoma other usable features include absence of an in situ carcinomatous component and the presence of low-grade mucoepidermoid areas in some of these high-grade lesions   Clinical presentationSymptoms are dependent on the size and location of the neoplasms. Large central tumors can cause symptoms of obstruction, with pneumonia, dyspnea or chest pain, whilst more peripheral lesions may be asymptomatic. In these cases, they are frequently encountered on routine chest X-ray.Radiographic featuresCTCT features are can be variable and nonspecific, although a well-defined ovoid or lobulated intraluminal or lung peripheral mass with moderate to marked heterogeneous contrast enhancement may suggest towards the diagnosis 1.Lesions may sometimes show punctate calcification and may adapt to branching feature of the airways 3.FDG PET/CTMay aid in differentiation from other lung tumors 5, but first of all, it has been shown to have high accuracy in detection of histopathological tumor differentiation 10-11: high-grade - high FDG-hypermetabolism (avid) low-grade - slight FDG-hypermetabolism (less or even non avid) Hence prediction of prognosis (and need for more aggressive treatment) may be possible 10-11.Treatment and prognosisMost lesions are generally regarded as low grade 7,10 and overall prognosis may be more favourable than other forms of lung cancer.For high-grade tumors prognosis may equate that of other forms of NSCLC s 9--11, hence adjuvant radiation and chemotherapy is often performed 9.
__label__Head __label__& __label__Neck Mucoepidermoid carcinoma is a tumor that usually occurs in the salivary glands. It can mimic most other tumors of the glands, and therefore is often considered in the differential.  On this page:  Article: Epidemiology Clinical presentation Pathology Radiographic features Treatment and prognosis Differential diagnosis References   Images: Cases and figures Imaging differential diagnosis   EpidemiologyMucoepidermoid carcinomas are seen throughout all adult age groups, but are most common in middle age (35-65 years of age) 5. However, it is the most common malignant salivary gland tumor of childhood 4-5. Overall, mucoepidermoid carcinomas account for 1,5:2.8-15.5% of all salivary gland tumors: 1-10% of all major salivary gland tumors 6.5-41% of minor salivary gland tumors  In the parotid gland they are the most common malignant primary neoplasm. A slight female predilection has been described, and radiation has been implicated as a risk factor 5.Clinical presentationMucoepidermoid carcinomas most frequently arise in the parotid gland, and presents as a painless swelling, with or without facial nerve involvement. These tumors can however be found anywhere there are salivary glands. Overall distribution across various glands is as follows 5: major salivary glands: ~50% * parotid gland: ~40% submandibular gland: ~7% sublingual gland: ~3%   minor salivary glands: ~50% palate: most common retromolar trigone floor of the mouth buccal mucosa lip tongue other: anywhere in the proximal aerodigestive tract, the lacrimal glands and even in the bronchi 2,5    As such, presentation will depend on the anatomic location.PathologyThe tumors are composed of a mixture of: mucus secreting cells (muco-) squamous cells (-epidermoid) lymphoid infiltrate often also present 3  HistologyHistology will often show clear mucin containing cells, which stain reddish pink with the mucicarmine stain. Mucoepidermoid tumors are graded histologically into: low grade: well-differentiated cells with little cellular atypia high proportion of mucous cells prominent cyst formation   intermediate grade: intermediate features high grade poorly differentiated with cellular pleomorphism high proportion of squamous cells solid with few if any cysts   Radiographic featuresRadiographic appearances largely depend on grade, making preoperative imaging important in planning and counseling. UltrasoundTypically a well-circumscribed hypoechoic lesion, with a partial or completely cystic appearance.  The lesion stands out against the relatively hyperechoic normal parotid gland.CTLow-grade tumors appear as well-circumscribed masses, usually with cystic components. The solid components enhance, and calcification is sometimes seen. They have appearances similar to benign mixed tumors. High-grade tumors on the other hand, have poorly defined margins, infiltrate locally and appear solid.MRIAgain, imaging is dependent on grade. Low-grade tumors have similar appearances to benign mixed tumors:  T1: low to intermediate signal; low signal cystic spaces  T2: intermediate to high signal; cystic areas will be high signal  T1 C+ (Gd): heterogeneous enhancement of solid components High grade tumors on the other hand have lower signal on T2 and poorly defined margins and infrequent cystic areas:  T1: low to intermediate signal  T2: intermediate to low signal It is essential to image the cranial nerves with fat saturated post contrast T1 sequences to assess for perineural spread, and as such the base of skull should be imaged up to and including the cavernous sinus and inner ear. Treatment and prognosisTreatment is dependent on grade and location: low grade (well circumscribed) can usually be treated with wide local excision and preservation of the facial nerve, without the need for neck dissection or adjuvant radiotherapy high grade (poorly circumscribed) usually requires complete parotidectomy, often with sacrifice of the facial nerve, neck dissection (as nodal metastases are common) and adjuvant radiotherapy Prognosis is also very dependent on grade, with low grade tumors having a 90-98% survival and a low local recurrence rate, compared to 30-54% surviving, and a very high local recurrence rate for high grade tumors 1,5.Additionally this tumor has a predilection for perineural spread, and careful and long term follow-up is therefore required.Differential diagnosisThe differential is therefore different according to appearance.For well circumscribed lesions consider:  benign mixed tumor (BMT): can be indistinguishable Warthin tumor adenoid cystic carcinoma For infiltrative lesions consider: adenoid cystic carcinoma   lymphoma (NHL) metastasis (especially squamous cell carcinoma metastases to intra-parotid nodes)

The most common locations are the following 1: head and neck (55%), most commonly sinonasal, followed by oral cavity anorectum (24%) female genital tract (18%) urinary tract (3%) Macroscopic appearanceUp to 40% of mucosal melanomas are amelanotic, meaning the tumors are at least partially devoid of the melanin pigment 2.StagingStaging system differs depending on the primary site of disease 2. Head and neck tumors are staged by the American Joint Committee on Cancer TNM system. Melanomas of the external lip and vulva are staged as cutaneous melanomas.

__label__Gastrointestinal ​Mucous fistulas​ are a surgically-formed connection between bypassed colon and the skin surface. It is a type of colostomy, but instead of letting ingested contents pass out of the body, a mucous fistula allows release of colonic secretions, mucus, and gas so that they do not build up over time.The mucous fistula empties into a bag. If a patient has a loop colostomy, then the stoma that enters into the downstream colon is essentially the mucous fistula, although it is not usually termed as such since the term mucous fistula is usually used for a separate stoma and bag.An alternative to a mucous fistula is a Hartmann pouch. With a Hartmann pouch, the bypassed downstream colon is not externalized, as with a mucous fistula, but the end is stapled off and a blind end is formed. Sometimes the amount of colon that needs to be resected during surgery does not leave enough downstream colon to permit externalization, and a Hartmann pouch is necessary.Terminology"Mucous" is the adjectival form of the noun "mucus". Therefore when people write "mucus fistula", they should really say "mucous fistula".

__label__Obstetrics __label__Gynaecology Müllerian duct anomalies (MDAs) are congenital abnormalities that occur when the Müllerian ducts (paramesonephric ducts) do not develop correctly. This may be as a result of complete agenesis, defective vertical or lateral fusion, or resorption failure.

This is in contrast to prostatic utricle cysts, which always arise at the level of the verumontanum and are always in the midline. The embryologic origin also explains why Müllerian duct cysts are larger and often extend superior to the prostate gland, while utricle cysts are usually smaller and are less likely to extend above the prostate gland.Müllerian duct cysts do not communicate with the urethra.Müllerian duct cysts are not associated with other abnormalities (utricle cysts are associated with a variety of genitourinary abnormalities).Radiographic featuresThese are seen on pelvic MRI or ultrasound as midline cystic lesions in the prostate that do not communicate with the urethra.Treatment and prognosisIn many cases no treatment is required at all. However if symptomatic then intervention may be required.

__label__Musculoskeletal __label__Paediatrics Multicentric carpal tarsal osteolysis is a rare skeletal disorder which is characterized by progressive osteolysis of the carpal, metacarpal and tarsal bones. It usually presents in early childhood with progressive pain and stiffness of the wrist, feet and elbow, clinically mimicking juvenile rheumatoid arthritis. This leads to joint deformities and is also often associated with chronic renal failure.  On this page:  Article: Epidemiology Clinical presentation Pathology Radiographic features Treatment and prognosis Differential diagnosis References   EpidemiologyMulticentric carpal tarsal osteolysis syndrome is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion with complete penetrance. It is caused by mutations in the MAFB (MAF BZIP transcription factor B) gene 2. Clinical presentationMost people with multicentric carpal tarsal osteolysis will have symptoms of cachexia, carpal osteolysis, EMG abnormality, gait disturbance, limited joint mobility, micrognathia, proptosis, proteinuria, wrist swelling, slender long bone, triangular face, and metacarpal osteolysis. Less common symptoms are camptodactyly of the finger, telecanthus, wide nasal bridge and downturned corners of mouth2.  Nephropathy can also occur which can lead to end-stage renal failure 3.PathologyThe pathogenesis of multicentric carpal tarsal osteolysis is still uncertain. It is thought that a mutation in the MAFB gene causes an imbalance in bone remodelling hence leading to osteolysis 4. Radiographic featuresPlain radiographPlain radiographs show the characteristic appearance of the progressive destruction of carpal and tarsal bones with relatively preserved metacarpals and phalanges. During the early stages, there is progressive demineralization of the carpal and tarsal bones with loss of bone contours. In the later stages, this progresses to resorption of adjacent tubular bones leading to the tapering of the proximal ends of the metacarpals and metatarsals with a characteristic "sucked candy" appearance 5. Treatment and prognosisMulticentric carpal tarsal osteolysis syndrome is a very rare disorder and no specific treatment exists yet for this condition 2. Differential diagnosis juvenile rheumatoid arthritis Gorham osteolysis 
__label__Central __label__Nervous __label__System Multicentric glioblastomas are uncommon and represent tumors which have multiple discrete areas of contrast enhancing tumor without connecting T2/FLAIR signal abnormality. They are considered to represent separate synchronous tumors. It must be noted that as imaging has improved, the frequency with which multicentric gliomas have been identified has reduced, as a result of being able to demonstrate connections between enhancing components more readily. In many cases, the pattern of enhancement strongly suggests that these represent microscopic spread, not seen to be linked by T2 signal abnormality, and thus multifocal rather than multicentric. Differential diagnosisIn contrast, multifocal glioblastomas have connecting T2/FLAIR signal abnormality and represent spread of tumor along white matter tracts.

__label__Urogenital __label__Paediatrics Multicystic dysplastic kidney (MCDK) is a type of non-heritable pediatric cystic renal disease. It results in multiple cysts being formed in utero in the affected kidney. On this page:  Article: Epidemiology Clinical presentation Pathology Radiographic features Treatment and prognosis Differential diagnosis See also References   Images:Cases and figures  EpidemiologyUnilateral incidence is estimated at 1:2500-4000. There may be a predisposition for the left kidney, a slightly higher incidence in males for unilateral MCDK and a higher incidence in females for bilateral MCDK.Clinical presentationMCDK develops in utero, and the diagnosis is often made either antenatally or in the early neonatal period if an ultrasound is performed. It may otherwise go unrecognised, and may be a common cause of renal agenesis, following complete involution during childhood.PathologyThe affected kidney (or renal segment) has no functioning renal tissue and is replaced by multiple cysts. Two main types have been described 2:  pelvi-infundibular most common multiple small non-communicating renal cysts representing the dilated calyces atresia of the ureter and renal pelvis may sometimes regress spontaneously 2     hydronephrotic-obstructivedominant cyst present in the renal pelvis  GeneticsThe vast majority are sporadic and non-familial. Rarely autosomal dominant forms are seen 8.AssociationsAssociated contralateral renal tract abnormalities are common (seen in ~50% of cases) and include:  vesicoureteric reflux (VUR): most common and seen in up to 20% 3   pelviureteric junction (PUJ) obstruction  5  ureteral ectopia vesicoureteric junction (VUJ) obstruction ureterocoele Syndromic associations include: Meckel-Gruber syndrome Zellweger syndrome Radiographic featuresThe diagnosis of MCDK is often made antenatally with multiple small cysts becoming evident as early as the 15th week of gestation 4. Over time appearances may change dramatically, ranging from complete involution to large multicystic masses.UltrasoundLobulated renal contour with multiple internal cysts of varying sizes and shapes: the renal parenchyma is usually fibrous and echogenic with absent or small hilar vessels. The cysts typically cluster and are non-communicating. Real time imaging is extremely useful to exclude any communication with the ureter and between each other.MRIThe non-ionizing radiation imaging modality is an important consideration in the pediatric population. MCDK cysts are eloquently demonstrated on T2 sequences.Nuclear medicineMAG3 or DTPA scan: particularly useful in the hydronephrotic form to assess for associated obstructive uropathy. Although it may show some flow to the kidney and possible cortical uptake, generally a void is seen on the renal bed compared to the contralateral side, excretion is never seen. Treatment and prognosisA normal life expectancy can be expected as long as the contralateral kidney is normal. Bilateral MCDK is fatal. Controversy exists over the need for prophylactic surgical excision of an MCDK, justified on the grounds of a small risk of malignant transformation, more commonly in adults with a persistent MCDK (i.e. has not spontaneously resolved) 2. More recently, conservative management with follow-up has been recommended 3.Complete spontaneous involution is said to occur in up to 60% of cases, but may take up to 10 years to occur 3. Longer term ongoing follow-up to assess what the lifetime rates of involution are in progress 3. If surgical resection is performed, it is done so early in life and is a simple and well-tolerated procedure 3.ComplicationsOccasionally an MCDK may become infected 2,3 or present with persistent mass effect or secondary hypertension 3.Differential diagnosisGiven the variable appearance of MCDK's, some other entities need to be included in the differential including 2:  hydronephrosis: fetal hydronephrosis: cystic spaces are interconnected cystic kidney diseases of childhood Wilms tumor tuberous sclerosis (TS)  congenital mesoblastic nephroma: usually presents as solid lesions See alsocongenital renal cystic disease

It is atraumatic and commonly bilateral. Poor coordination of the rotator cuff muscles contributes to the worsening of laxity. In some cases, it may have ​psychiatric cause with subjective symptoms that are not relieved by surgery. There is a positive family history in a minority of cases with genetic abnormal collagen production or cross-linking; e.g. Marfan or Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. Radiographic featuresUsually, there is no abnormality of the labrum, ligaments or tendons nor evidence of previous shoulder dislocation. However, gradually the longterm subluxation results in labral injury and rotator cuff impingement.Some of the possible radiologic findings are: glenoid hypoplasia glenoid retroversion small labrum   generalized joint laxity  Treatment and prognosisTreatment is mainly rehabilitation; if surgery required then tightening of the inferior capsule and rotator interval may prove helpful.

__label__Musculoskeletal __label__Central __label__Nervous __label__System Multifocal motor neuropathy (MMN) is a rare autoimmune peripheral neuropathy, which primarily affects the upper limbs, with insidious deterioration over decades.  On this page:  Article: Epidemiology Clinical presentation Pathology Radiographic features Treatment and prognosis References   EpidemiologyMultifocal motor neuropathy typically affects young to middle-aged men with a prevalence of less than 1 in 100,000 1. Clinical presentationMultifocal motor neuropathy is a rare autoimmune peripheral neuropathy, predominantly affecting the upper limbs with a distal asymmetrical pattern. Lower motor neuron signs are always seen, with fasciculations sometimes present. Multifocal motor neuropathy (MMN) may therefore be mistaken for motor neuron disease (MND), but the characteristic conduction block seen on electrophysiology distinguishes MMN from MND. Variation in the extent of measurable conduction block and axonal degeneration, causing denervation atrophy, means that not all patients present with muscle wasting. However, multifocal motor neuropathy is a lifelong, slowly progressive (decline over decades) condition, during which time atrophy tends to develop. Eventually, multifocal motor neuropathy becomes confluent, affecting all four limbs, with accumulating motor disability over time. PathologyEtiologyIn most cases of multifocal motor neuropathy, focal inflammatory demyelination of single motor nerves is mediated by anti-GM1 ganglioside IgM antibody 1. Radiographic featuresOn MRI, asymmetrical focal or diffuse signal hyperintensity and enlargement of the brachial plexus is classical. This differentiates multifocal motor neuropathy from other causes of lower motor neuron syndromes, such as cervical entrapment neuropathies, spinal muscular atrophies, nerve sheath tumors, and cervical ribs. Imaging findings demonstrate poor correlation with disease severity 2. Treatment and prognosisApproximately 80% of patients with multifocal motor neuropathy respond well to intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) 3. Treatment is given regularly, with IVIg being the only recognized therapy. Of note, multifocal motor neuropathy may paradoxically worsen with steroid treatment.

__label__Central __label__Nervous __label__System Multinodular and vacuolating neuronal tumor (MVNT) is a newly recognized cytoarchitectural pattern in the recently revised 2016 edition of the WHO classification of CNS tumors.Radiologically, MVNTs appear as small 'bubbly' indolent subcortical tumors that sometimes present with seizures. These tumors have been most frequently identified in the temporal lobe, although that is likely to be due to that location being more likely to result in seizures than necessarily a predilection for that lobe 1-4. On this page:  Article: Epidemiology Clinical presentation Pathology Radiographic features Treatment and prognosis Differential diagnosis References   Images:Cases and figures  EpidemiologyThe true epidemiology of these tumors is unknown as they have only been recently described and many are asymptomatic and thus likely undiagnosed (or misdiagnosed). Reported cases are mostly in young to middle-aged individuals with adult-onset epilepsy 1-4. Clinical presentationMany of these lesions are probably asymptomatic and may be found incidentally on imaging for other reasons, and have, over the year, been misinterpreted a variety of other lesions (see differential diagnosis below). In some individuals these tumors are epileptogenic. PathologyAlthough currently considered a tumor and a growth pattern of gangliocytomas (WHO grade I), it is possible that MVNTs are closer to developmental abnormalities than true tumors 5. Histopathologic hallmark of MVNT consists of neuroepithelial cells with conspicuous stromal vacuolation arranged in nodules principally within the deep cortical ribbon and superficial subcortical white matter 1-3. Immunostaining is positive for synaptophysin, HuC/HuD neuronal antigens and p62 but were negative for other markers (e.g. IDH1, nestin, NeuN, neurofilament, GFAP, and CD34) 1-4. Radiographic featuresCTSmaller lesions are difficult to identify, but if seen will appear as non-enhancing low attenuation lesions deep to the cortex in the subcortical white matter. MRIThese tumors appear as a cluster of well-circumscribed high T2 signal 'bubbles' located predominantly in the subcortical white matter but can involve the overlying cortex 1,3,4.   T1: hypointense to adjacent gray and white matter  T1 C+: usually no enhancement some faint focal enhancement may be seen 3,4     T2: hyperintense to grey and white matter, almost as high as CSF  FLAIR: do not suppress Treatment and prognosisMVNTs appear to be benign tumors with very indolent biological behavior which can, if asymptomatic, be followed by imaging alone. In symptomatic patients (epileptic) surgical resection often controls seizures, with no tumor regrowth reported 1-4. Differential diagnosisPossible considerations include  dysembryoplastic-neuroepithelial-tumor - DNET can appear similar but usually is mostly cortical (rather than subcortical) often has bright FLAIR rim     focal cortical dysplasia (type II) high T2 signal deep to the cortex is in the same location but is usually associated with a radial glial band (transmantle sign) and with thickened abnormal overlying cortex   perivascular spaces location can be similar usually more elongated along vessel long axis fully attenuating on FLAIR

Patients are usually euthyroid, but the nodules may also be hypo- or hyperfunctioning, resulting in systemic symptoms from hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism, respectively.PathologyMultinodular goitres develop from simple goitres as a result of repeated instances of stimulation and involution 4. Most of the nodules are hyperplastic or adenomatous with varying degree of cystic/liquefactive degeneration. Presence of serous/colloid fluid may be noted.A nodule in multinodular goiter may harbor malignancy. A family history of malignancy and prior neck radiation exposure are known risk factors 2.Radiographic featuresUltrasoundSonography remains the first radiological investigation to screen the nodules and look for any suspicion of malignant change in the nodules which is not uncommon.Usually, the benign nodules in a multinodular goiter show the following features: iso-hyperechoic surrounding hypoechoic halo spongiform/honeycomb pattern anechoic areas may contain colloid fluid which may show echogenic foci with comet tail artifacts  see: colloid nodule    peripheral (eggshell) or coarse calcifications Doppler: peripheral vessels are usually noted, may show intranodular vascularity (mostly in hyperfunctioning nodules) It is important to screen for the presence of malignant features (if any) in any of the nodules and subsequent FNA can be done from the suspicious nodule.Malignant sonographic features hypoechoic solid intranodular blood flow large size: the cut-off is often taken as 10 mm to warrant an FNA presence of microcalcifications: almost always warrants an FNA Benign sonographic features large cystic component hyperechoic solid  comet tail artifact  halo See main article assessment of thyroid lesions for further details. Nuclear medicine Tc-99m pertechnetate or radioiodine (I-123) demonstrate an enlarged gland, with heterogeneous uptake thyroid uptake scan determines the activity of the gland Plain radiograph goiter is in the differential for an anterior/superior mediastinal mass and is associated with the cervicothoracic sign  associated with deviation of the trachea CT not a primary modality for diagnosis, but may be seen incidentally CT may be useful for fully characterizing the extent of substernal (retrosternal) goiter  an enlarged and heterogeneous thyroid gland suggests the diagnosis, which is confirmed by ultrasound or scintigraphy Treatment and prognosisTreatment of multinodular goiter may be pursued if the thyroid is hyperfunctioning, or if the goiter is causing local mass effect.

In some situations other techniques like MR spectroscopy (MRS) may also be employed.The detection and localization of clinically significant prostate cancer in patients with negative biopsy or without a previous biopsy is a major goal of multiparametric MRI (mpMRI) 1-3.Clinically significant prostate cancer has been defined on histology as Gleason score ≥7 (including 3+4 with prominent but not predominant Gleason 4 component), and/or volume ≥0.5 mL, and/or extraprostatic extension (EPE) 2.Interpretation and reporting of mpMRI should be done following standardized scoring systems, such as Prostate Imaging-Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS v2.1) 2.In order to improve the accuracy and reproducibility of multiparametric MRI some clinical considerations (timing of MRI after biopsy, patient preparation, and information), as well as technical specifications with respect to magnetic field strength, choice of the coil (endorectal vs pelvic), and more importantly sequence parameters and orientation, have to be fulfilled 2.T2W imagesT2 weighted images are used in the evaluation of the prostatic anatomy, in particular for the assessment of the transition zone (TZ).They also depict abnormalities in the peripheral zone (PZ), central zone (CZ) and anterior fibromuscular stroma (AFMS) of the gland, and to assess extraprostatic extension (EPE) and seminal vesicle invasion (SVI).Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI)Diffusion-weighted imaging reflects the random motion of water molecules and adds a key functional component to multiparametric MRI.With regards to PI-RADS, DWI is used as the primary evaluation of the peripheral zone (PZ) of the prostate gland but can also upgrade a focal lesion of the transition zone if they differ from the predominant background appearance.They can also help to differentiate seminal vesicle invasion from bleeding.Contrast-enhanced (DCE) MRIDynamic contrast-enhanced MRI adds another functional component to multiparametric MRI (mpMRI).It serves as a secondary component in PI-RADS (v2.1), upgrading a PI-RADS 3 lesion to PI-RADS 4 assessment category if there is early enhancement.See also dynamic contrast-enhancement in prostate cancer.
__label__Musculoskeletal Multipartite hallux sesamoids are a commonly seen normal variant, present in up to 33% of hallux sesamoids. They are more commonly bipartite than tripartite. The medial (tibial) sesamoid is more likely to be multipartite than the lateral (fibular) sesamoid because it more commonly has more than one ossification center. Bipartite hallux sesamoids are bilateral in ~70% (range 50-85%) of cases. Differential diagnosisThe principal differential diagnosis is a hallux sesamoid fracture. It can be difficult to differentiate because bipartite hallux sesamoids are more likely to fracture than complete hallux sesamoids. Features that support a bipartite over a fractured sesamoid include: transverse lucency smooth, well-corticated margins sum of the two parts is greater than the adjacent (and hopefully normal) sesamoid

__label__Vascular __label__Head __label__& __label__Neck __label__Interventional Multiphase CT angiography is an evolving imaging technique in acute ischemic stroke. The technique aims to quickly and reliably identify brain which is potentially salvageable with intervention. Brain tissue viability depends on many factors, with this technique assessing collateral leptomeningeal blood flow. Reliable identification of good versus bad collateral flow is essential to help guide patient selection for endovascular reperfusion 1.On single-phase CT angiography (CTA), leptomeningeal collateral scoring systems are used to evaluate collateral flow, but can be inaccurate due to the absence of temporal resolution 2. Multi-phase CTA provides cerebral angiograms in three distinct phases (peak arterial, peak venous and late venous) after the injection of contrast material, allowing for time-resolved assessment 3.The collateral blood flow is assessed by comparison of pial arterial filling in the ischemic area of the brain on CTA with that of similar arteries in the contralateral hemisphere. The advantage of multi-phase is that it can detect temporal delay in the filling of vessels in addition to the prominence and extent of vessels detectable with a single-phase technique. Some sites use a single delayed phase CTA.Good collateral flow is associated with 1: better clinical outcomes less risk of hemorrhagic transformation a greater likelihood of successful recanalization While the most appropriate imaging technique to guide intervention in acute ischemic stroke is not entirely clear at present (January 2017), CT perfusion studies are widely used in many centers. The advantages of multi-phase CTA when compared CT perfusion include: smaller radiation dose images which are easily obtained and interpreted without postprocessing reduction of the impact of patient motion on images 2,3  In addition, good inter-rater reliability and prediction of clinical outcome have been reported 3.Related articles single-phase CTA collateral scores multiphase CTA collateral score

__label__Hepatobiliary Multiple biliary hamartomas (MBHs) are a rare cause of multiple benign hepatic lesions. The condition is also known as von Meyenburg complexes, multiple bile duct hamartomas or biliary microhamartomas. Multiple biliary hamartomas are asymptomatic and usually found incidentally, when it is important to differentiate them from other causes of multiple liver lesions, particularly metastases. On this page:  Article: Epidemiology Pathology Radiographic features Treatment and prognosis History and etymology Differential diagnosis References   Images: Cases and figures Imaging differential diagnosis   EpidemiologyThe prevalence of multiple biliary hamartomas (MBH) is ~3% at autopsy 1, however, prevalence on imaging is <1% as most hamartomas are <5 mm in size and often not detected. MBH is reportedly three times more common in women than men 2.AssociationsMultiple biliary hamartomas are known to be associated with:  autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) 3   polycystic liver disease 3  Several case reports have suggested possible malignant transformation of biliary hamartomas into cholangiocarcinoma 4 and hepatocellular carcinoma 5.PathologyBiliary hamartomas are composed of small disorganized clusters of dilated cystic bile ducts lined by a single layer of cuboidal cells and surrounded by an abundant fibrocollagenous stroma 1,6,7. Although they may communicate with the biliary tree, they generally do not. They are thought to arise from embryonic bile duct remnants that have failed to involute.Radiographic featuresMultiple small round or irregular lesions throughout the liver, with some predilection for subcapsular regions 1. Usually, 5-30 mm in size when detected by imaging (however most lesions are <5 mm when detected by pathologists). Radiographic findings can be non-specific and may be hard to differentiate from metastases and microabscesses.UltrasoundSmall hamartomas are usually echogenic if discretely seen. Often tiny individual hamartomas cannot be resolved and are instead interpreted as diffuse heterogenous liver echotexture. Larger hamartomas (>10 mm) may appear hypoechoic or anechoic and comet-tail artifact may be seen 8. The appearances may mimic metastases (see ultrasound appearances of liver metastases).CTBiliary hamartomas are hypoattenuating and often show no enhancement 6. Occasionally an enhancing nodule or rim may be identified in a small number of lesions.AngiographyOnly a limited number of the many lesions that are actually present can be seen as grape-like clusters of abnormal vascularity with contrast persisting into the venous phase 9.MRIMost biliary hamartomas are:  T1: hypointense compared to liver parenchyma  T2 hyperintense depending on TE, may approach CSF-signal intensity    T1 C+ (Gd) usually no enhancement thin peripheral rim enhancement has been described (see below), this may represent compressed normal liver parenchyma 13,14    However, in ~90% of cases an occasional hamartoma can be found containing a mural nodule (fibrocollagenous stroma, see pathology) or rim (see above) that is T1 isointense and T2 intermediate, of which ~90% will enhance. Hamartomas show no diffusion restriction on DWI sequences 2,8,10.Nuclear medicineTc-99m DISIDA scan shows delayed uptake and delayed emptying of tracer within larger biliary hamartomas 11.Treatment and prognosisAside from the possible risk of malignant transformation (see associations earlier), multiple biliary hamartomas are a benign asymptomatic condition with no long-term consequences, and no treatment is required.History and etymologyHans von Meyenburg (1887-1971) was a German-born Swiss pathologist, who first described the pathology of biliary hamartomas in an article published in 1918 12,15. Differential diagnosisGeneral imaging differential considerations include:  multiple liver metastases: more variable size and prominent enhancement  multiple liver microabscesses: clinical context is important, may have diffusion restriction on MRI multiple small hepatic cysts   Caroli disease: demonstrates enhancing central dot sign of portal radicles

__label__Musculoskeletal __label__Haematology __label__Oncology Multiple myeloma is a monoclonal gammopathy and is the most common primary malignant bone neoplasm in adults. It arises from red marrow due to the monoclonal proliferation of plasma cells and manifests in a wide range of radiographic abnormalities. Multiple myeloma remains incurable. On this page:  Article: Terminology Epidemiology Clinical presentation Pathology Radiographic features Treatment and prognosis Differential diagnosis Related articles References   Images: Cases and figures Imaging differential diagnosis   TerminologyFour main patterns are recognized: disseminated form: multiple well-defined "punched out" lytic lesions: predominantly affecting the axial skeleton disseminated form: diffuse skeletal osteopenia solitary plasmacytoma: a single large/expansile lesion most commonly in a vertebral body or in the pelvis osteosclerosing myeloma The remainder of this article relates to the disseminated forms. Please refer to the article plasmacytoma for discussion of the latter.Smoldering multiple myeloma refers to a form that falls on the spectrum between monoclonal gammopathy of unknown significance (MGUS) and active multiple myeloma. Patients are asymptomatic, with worse biochemistry than MGUS but without the end-organ damage of active multiple myeloma 9.EpidemiologyMultiple myeloma is a common malignancy in patients above 40 (70% of cases are diagnosed between ages 50 and 70 with a median age of diagnosis being 69 years) with a male predilection (M: F 2:1) 7,12. It accounts for 1% of all malignancies and 10% of all hematological disease 12. Multiple myeloma and osteosarcoma combined account for approximately 50% of all primary bone malignancies 7.Clinical presentationClinical presentation of patients with multiple myeloma is varied, and includes 1,2,7: bone pain initially intermittent, but becomes constant worse with activity/weight-bearing, and thus is worse during the day   anemiatypically normochromic/normocytic  renal failure proteinuria hypercalcemia The typical features can be recalled with the mnemonic CRAB 12. Presentation may also be with a complication, including:  pathological fracture vertebral compression fracture long bone fracture (e.g. proximal femur)   amyloidosis recurrent infection: e.g. pneumonia due to leukopenia  plasmacytomas typically progress to multiple myeloma The initial presentation occasionally is a polyneuropathy when it is part of a POEMS syndrome (mostly the sclerotic form).Laboratory findings include: reverse albumin/globulin ratio (i.e. low albumin, high globulin) monoclonal gammopathy (IgA and/or IgG peak) Bence Jones protein (Ig light chain) proteinuria hypercalcemia decreased or normal alkaline phosphatase (ALP) unless there is a pathological fracture due to impaired osteoblastic function The most popular staging system, the International Staging System, uses the combination of β2-microglobulin test and serum albumin 6. Approximately 1% of cases will have negative serum electrophoresis and negative urine Bence Jones protein.  PathologyMultiple myeloma results from monoclonal proliferation of malignant plasma cells which produce immunoglobulins (commonly IgG) and infiltrate haemopoietic locations (i.e. red marrow).  Renal involvement is common and renal failure is multifactorial: obstructive casts form in the renal tubules composed of Bence Jones proteins, immunoglobulins, albumin and Tamm-Horsfall proteinsmost common cause of renal failure in multiple myeloma  direct nephrotoxicity of Bence Jones proteins on the epithelial cells of the renal tubules hypercalcemia and dehydration hyperuricemia and urate nephropathy due to high cell turnover  amyloidosis (AL type) increased risk of renal infection DistributionDistribution of multiple myeloma mirrors that of red marrow in the older individual, and thus this is mostly encountered in the axial skeleton and proximal appendicular skeleton: vertebrae (most common) ribs skull shoulder girdle pelvis long bones extraskeletal structures (extraosseous myeloma): rare  Radiographic featuresRadiology has a number of roles in the diagnosis and management for multiple myeloma: suggest the diagnosis / exclude other causes assess possible mechanical complications (e.g. pathological fracture) assess disease progression Disseminated multiple myeloma has two common radiological appearances, although it should be noted that initially, radiographs may be normal, despite the presence of symptoms. The two main diffuse patterns are 12: numerous, well-circumscribed, lytic bone lesions (more common) punched out lucencies raindrop skull 7   endosteal scalloping    generalized osteopenia (less common)often associated with vertebral compression fractures/vertebra plana   Plain radiographA skeletal survey is essential not only for the diagnosis of multiple myeloma but also in pre-empting potential complications (e.g. pathological fracture) and assessing response to therapy. ~40% bone destruction is required for lesion detection, thus giving the skeletal survey a high false-negative rate of ~50% (range 30-70%) 12. The vast majority of lesions are purely lytic, sharply defined/punched out, with endosteal scalloping when abutting the cortex. Lesions are sclerotic in only 3% of patients 7.CTWhole-body low dose (WBLD) CT is more accurate than a skeletal survey with a sensitivity of ~70% and specificity of ~90% with a dose 1-2x that of a skeletal survey 12. WBLD CT is also better to assess the risk of pathological fracture in severely affected bones as well as the presence of extramedullary lesions 12. MRIMRI is more sensitive in detecting multiple lesions compared to the standard plain film skeletal survey and CT 8,12. Five patterns have been described 12: normal bone marrow signal diffuse involvement focal involvement combined diffuse and focal involvement variegated ("salt and pepper") MRI signal characteristicsMost frequently used MR sequences for the evaluation of bone marrow are conventional T1 spin-echo and T2 spin-echo sequences 11.  T1 typically low signal  high-grade, diffuse involvement may become isointense to adjacent normal marrow    T2 with fat-suppression high signal infiltration of the ribs is probably best appreciated on T2 images with fat suppression, appearing bright: ‘white ribs sign’    T1 C+ (Gd)  ​​hyperintense several enhancement curves may be seen: type 4 curve: Represents a steep wash-in of contrast medium, due to the high vascularization and perfusion with leakage through the highly permeable capillaries, followed by an early wash-out back into the intravascular space because of the small interstitial space with closely packed plasma cells 10-11  ​type 3 and type 5 curves may also be seen      DWI/ADC: Lesions usually exhibit restricted diffusion, with higher signal on high b-value DWI compared to the very low signal of normal background marrow 11  Nuclear medicineBone scintigraphyThe bone scan appearance of patients with disseminated multiple myeloma is variable due to the potential lack of osteoblastic activity. Larger lesions may be either hyperactive (hot) or photopenic (cold). Bone scans may also be normal. Therefore, bone scans usually do not contribute significant information to the workup of patients with suspected or established disseminated multiple myeloma, as the sensitivity of detecting lesions is less than that of a plain film skeletal survey 7.FDG PET-CTFDG PET-CT is effective in identifying the distribution of disease. F-18 FDG uptake by the myeloma lesions corresponds to lytic bone lesions or soft tissue plasmacytomas seen on CT. However, focal high FDG uptake in the bone may be considered a positive lesion even in the absence of osteolysis on CT.Treatment and prognosisCurrently, multiple myeloma remains incurable, although the introduction of thalidomide, lenalidomide, and bortezomib (proteasome inhibitor) have provided significant survival gains 6. These are typically used in combination with older agents such as cyclophosphamide, melphalan, prednisolone and doxorubicin 6. Treatment response is usually assessed by measuring serum markers and bone marrow sampling. Stem-cell harvest and autologous stem cell transplant post-chemotherapeutic/radiotherapy bone marrow ablation are also used, although relapse is inevitable.Response assessmentAs imaging is not required to diagnose multiple myeloma, assessment of treatment response does not necessitate imaging studies, with the exception of so-called "imaging plus minimal residual disease negative" status, which requires FDG PET. However, patients who have known lesions identified on radiologic studies of various modalities at baseline should have these reevaluated as part of response assessment. See the separate article on the International Myeloma Working Group response criteria.Differential diagnosisThe main differential is that of widespread bony metastases. Findings that favor the diagnosis of bone metastases over that of multiple myeloma include: more commonly affect the vertebral pedicles rather than vertebral bodies rarely involve mandible, distal axial skeleton although both entities have variable bone scan appearances (both hot and cold) unlike myeloma, extensive bony metastases rarely have a normal appearance Other rare entities include:Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia

It is considered to be more common in younger patients and in those with non-secretory myeloma and IgD myeloma 3.Radiographic features Imaging features are non-specific and widely variable depending on site. The condition can mimic other pathologies.General image interpretation guidelineWhen there is known background multiple myeloma, the development of focal soft-tissue masses should be considered highly suspicious for extraosseous myeloma. In particular, the development of extraosseous soft tissue masses in a myeloma patient after stem cell transplantation should raise suspicion for extraosseous myeloma. It is important to know if there is more than one lesion.DiagnosisIn most cases, especially patients with a coexisting malignancy, tissue diagnosis is often considered essential.Treatment and prognosisThe presence of extraosseous myeloma generally implies a poorer prognosis 3. More content required for treatment.Differential diagnosisExtraosseous myeloma can mimic a vast number of entities dependent on location.If there is only one lesion and the lesion reveals myelomatous/plasma cells on a biopsy, consider extramedullary plasmacytoma.

They include:  classic multiple sclerosis (Charcot type) tumefactive multiple sclerosis Marburg type (acute malignant) Schilder type (diffuse cerebral sclerosis) Balo concentric sclerosis This article concerns itself primarily with classic (Charcot type) multiple sclerosis. The other variants are discussed separately. Importantly, neuromyelitis optica (Devic disease) was considered a variant of multiple sclerosis, but is now recognized as a distinct entity, and is therefore also discussed separately.  On this page:  Article: Epidemiology Clinical presentation Pathology Radiographic features Treatment and prognosis Differential diagnosis Related articles References   Images:Cases and figures  EpidemiologyThe presentation is usually between adolescence and the sixth decade, with a peak at approximately 35 years of age 12,19. There is a strong, well recognized female predilection with a F:M ratio of approximately 2:1 19. Multiple sclerosis has a fascinating geographic distribution: it is rarely found in equatorial regions (e.g. 15 per 100,000), with incidence gradually increasing with distance from the equator (e.g. 250 per 100,000) 12,19. Clinical presentationClinical presentation is both highly variable acutely, as a result of varying plaque location, as well as over time. Examples of common clinical features include 23,24: brainstem and cranial nerve involvement: optic neuritis  internuclear ophthalmoplegia (often bilateral) trigeminal neuralgia diplopia (e.g. due to abducens nerve palsy) vertigo   cerebellum involvement: ataxia and gait disturbance oscillopsia   cerebrum and spinal cord involvement: limb sensory loss or paraesthesias upper motor neuron signs Lhermitte sign urinary incontinence   others: fatigue depression Uhthoff phenomenon: heat and exercise worsen symptoms cognitive decline   ClassificationA number of patterns of longitudinal disease have been described 11,12:  relapsing-remitting most common (70% of cases) patients exhibit periodic symptoms with complete recovery (early on)    secondary progressiveapproximately 85% of patients with relapsing-remitting MS eventually enter a secondary progressive phase   primary progressive uncommon (10% of cases)  patients do not have remissions, with neurological deterioration being relentless   progressive with relapses  benign multiple sclerosis  15-50% of cases defined as patients who remain functionally active for over 15 years   As is evident from this list, there is overlap, and in some cases, patients can drift from one pattern to another.Upon presentation patients often have evidence of multiple previous asymptomatic lesions, and the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis can be strongly inferred. In other instances patients present with the first plaque. This is known as clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) and not all patients go on to develop multiple sclerosis.Radiologically isolated syndrome (RIS) is another entity based on MRI brain findings which described as incidental white matter lesions suggestive of MS on imaging in a patient without associated clinical symptoms 17.DiagnosisThe diagnosis of multiple sclerosis requires the constellation of clinical findings and various investigations (see McDonald diagnostic criteria for multiple sclerosis), including 19: typical history oligoclonal bands in CSF immunoglobulin G in serum abnormal visual evoked potential MR imaging lack of viable alternative diagnosis PathologyThe exact etiology is poorly known although it is believed to have both genetic and acquired contributory components. An infectious agent (e.g. EBV), or at least a catalyst, has long been suspected due to the geographic distribution and presence of clusters of cases; however, no agent has yet been firmly confirmed. Some authors also suggested that "chronic cerebrospinal venous insufficiency" can cause or exacerbate MS but this theory has not been proven by further investigations 15.Multiple sclerosis is believed to result from a cell-mediated autoimmune response against one's own myelin components, with loss of oligodendrocytes, with little or no axonal degeneration in the acute phase; however, in later stages, loss of oligodendrocytes results in axonal degeneration. Demyelination occurs in discrete perivenular foci, termed plaques, which range in size from a few millimeters to a few centimeters 19.Each lesion goes through three pathological stages:  early acute stage (active plaques) active myelin breakdown  plaques appear pink and swollen    subacute stage plaques become paler in color ("chalky") abundant macrophages    chronic stage (inactive plaques/gliosis) little or no myelin breakdown gliosis with associated volume loss appear grey/translucent   Associations a strong association with HLA-DR2 class II has been identified 11   Melkersson-Rosenthal syndrome: postulated Radiographic featuresPlaques can occur anywhere in the central nervous system. They are typically ovoid in shape and perivenular in distribution. CTCT features are usually non-specific, and significant change may be seen on MRI with an essentially normal CT scan. Features that may be present include: plaques can be homogeneously hypoattenuating 8,11  brain atrophy may be evident in with long-standing chronic MS 5  some plaques may show contrast enhancement in the active phase 7,11  MRIMRI has revolutionised the diagnosis and surveillance of patients with MS. Not only can an MRI confirm the diagnosis (see McDonald diagnostic criteria for multiple sclerosis), but follow-up scans can assess response to treatment and help determine the disease pattern. ProtocolAlthough many sequences are contributory, the 2018 Revised Guidelines of the Consortium of MS Centers MRI Protocol for the Diagnosis and Follow-up of MS plaques lists the following core sequences 25:  FLAIR (axial and sagittal) ideally performed as a 3D volumetric scan (1 mm isotropic), or 3 mm contiguous    T1: 3D inversion recovery prepared gradient echo T2 (axial): 3D or 2D DWI (axial) Note: contrast is not necessary for routine asymptomatic followup. Sequence utility  T1 lesions are typically iso- to hypointense (T1 black holes)   callososeptal interface may have multiple small hypointense lesions (Venus necklace) or the corpus callosum may merely appear thinned 11  hyperintense lesions are associated with brain atrophy and advancing disease 18     T2 lesions are typically hyperintense acute lesions often have surrounding edema    SWI central vein sign: at higher field strengths most plaques have been shown to be perivenular (at 3 T, 45% of lesions; at 7 T, 87% of lesions) 19    FLAIR lesions are typically hyperintense a very early sign is called ependymal dot-dash sign 16  when these propagate centrifugally along the medullary venules and arranged perpendicular to the lateral ventricles in a triangular configuration (extending radially outward - best seen on parasagittal images), they are termed Dawson's fingers  FLAIR is more sensitive than T2 in the detection of juxtacortical and periventricular plaques, while T2 is more sensitive to infratentorial lesions    T1 C+ (Gd) active lesions show enhancement enhancement is often incomplete around the periphery (open ring sign)    DWI/ADC active plaques may demonstrate high or low ADC (increased or decreased diffusion) 10-11-22  also typically open ring in morphology    MR spectroscopy  NAA peaks may be reduced within plaques, which is the most common and remarkable finding choline and lactate are found to be increased in the acute pathologic phase    double inversion recovery DIR: a new sequence that suppresses both CSF and white matter signal and offers better delineation of the plaques. Location of the plaques can be infratentorial, in the deep white matter, periventricular, juxtacortical or mixed white matter-grey matter lesions.Even on a single scan, some features are helpful in predicting relapsing-remitting vs. progressive disease. Features favoring progressive disease include: large numerous plaques hyperintense T1 lesions Treatment and prognosisThe aim of treatment is twofold: to curtail progression (disease-modifying agents) and symptomatic relief. Steroids, interferon, monoclonal antibodies and autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation are all used. Although discussion of individual agents and therapies is well beyond the scope of this article, it is worth being aware of the main agents available and their mechanism of action 20: interferon beta: inhibition of T-lymphocyte proliferation glatiramer acetate: immunomodulation teriflunomide (Aubagio®): reduces both T-cell and B-cell activation and proliferation dimethyl fumarate (Tecfidera®): immunomodulation fingolimod (Gilenya®): prevents lymphocyte migration out of lymph nodes and into CNS natalizumab (Tysabri®): inhibits binding of lymphocytes to endothelium alemtuzumab (Lemtrada®): immunomodulation of T-cell and B-cell function mitoxantrone: reduces T-cell and B-cell proliferation and reduces T-cell activation ComplicationsIn addition to the potential for disease progression resulting in progressive neurological impairment, a number of specific complications need to be considered. These include 20,21:   progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) and other less common CNS JC virus manifestations (JC virus granule cell neuronopathy, JC virus encephalopathy, and JC virus meningitis)particularly in patients treated with natalizumab with positive JC virus serology   PML-IRISa complication of cessation of natalizumab or treatment for natalizumab-related PML with plasma exchange or immunoabsorption 21    primary CNS lymphomararely lymphoma appears to arise from previously identified demyelinating lesions  PrognosisPrognosis is variable and depends on the pattern of disease a patient has (e.g. primary progressive carries a worse prognosis than relapsing-remitting). In general, patients with relapsing-remitting MS will progress to secondary progressive disease in 10 years and will require ambulatory aids (e.g. cane/wheelchair/frame) in another 5 to 15 years 12. Approximately half of the affected individuals will no longer be independently ambulatory after 20 years 19. Overall life expectancy is also reduced, by 7 to 14 years 19. Differential diagnosisThe differential diagnosis is dependent on the location and appearance of demyelination. For classic (Charcot type) MS, the differential can be divided into intracranial and spinal involvement. For intracranial disease, the differential includes almost all other demyelinating diseases as well as: CNS fungal infection (e.g. Cryptococcus neoformans) - patients tend to be immunocompromised  mucopolysaccharidosis (e.g. Hurler disease) - congenital and occurs in a younger age group  Marchiafava-Bignami disease (for callosal lesions)  Susac syndrome CNS manifestations of primary antiphospholipid syndrome 13  For spinal involvement, the following should be considered: transverse myelitis infection spinal cord tumors (e.g. astrocytomas) Multiple sclerosis variants (e.g. tumefactive MS, Devic disease) are discussed separately. 
__label__Central __label__Nervous __label__System This is a basic article for medical students and other non-radiologistsMultiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic demyelinating condition affecting the central nervous system. Diagnosis requires good history, clinical examination, appropriate imaging, and laboratory tests (cerebrospinal fluid for IgG index and oligoclonal bands).It is typified by "plaques" of disease which are spread by location and time. MRI is frequently the first-line imaging modality for diagnosis and follow-up.

__label__Paediatrics __label__Musculoskeletal Multiple synostoses syndrome (SYNS), proximal symphalangism (SYM), tarsal-carpal coalition (TCC) syndrome, stapes ankylosis with broad thumbs and toes (SABTT), and brachydactyly B2 (BDB2) are overlapping autosomal dominant conditions united by typically displaying ankylosis of the proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joints, and carpal and tarsal bones. PathologyThey all typically display ankylosis of the PIP joints, carpal and tarsal bones. More specifically: SYM displays variable fusion of the PIP joints and occasionally metacarpophalangeal joints  SYNS is distinguished from SYM by more severe joint involvement which may include the hips and vertebrae; affected individuals may have characteristic facial features and at times conductive hearing loss  TCC has a focus on carpal and tarsal fusion in addition to brachydactyly, varus/valgus foot anomalies SABTT is known for its broad thumbs and toes in addition to conductive hearing loss brachydactyly is as the name describes GeneticsMutations in specific genes have been found to be responsible for more than one syndrome type. For example, different mutations within the NOG locus (the gene encoding for the noggin protein( can result in all five overlapping syndromes 1 and the same specific mutations in NOG, in different families, has resulted in the separate diagnoses of SYM1, SABTT and BDB2 1, and TCC and SYM 2. Similarly, an allele of GDF5 results in both SYNS and BDA1 in different families 3. This has led to the suggestion, that these syndromes are part of a spectrum with variable penetrance 1,4.Whilst these syndromes overlap with respect to causative genes, four SYNS subtypes have been described. Each SYNS subtype is associated with a specific genetic mutation. This may suggest that the above-described syndromes (SYNS, SYM, TCC, SABTT and BDB2) could be better classified as variable penetrance of the four subtypes of SYNS.All four subtypes of SYNS have variable carpal and tarsal fusion 5. In addition, all multiple synostoses syndromes with the exception of SYN4 display symphalangism in the hands and humeroradial synostoses. Other differentiating features include 5:  SYNS1  hands and feet: brachydactyly elbow: elbow joint dysplasia spine: cervical vertebral fusions hearing: early conductive hearing loss facial: long face, broad tubular nose, short philtrum, thin upper vermilion, strabismus other: pectus carinatum     SYNS2 hands and feet: brachydactyly spine: vertebral fusions facial: broad hemicylindrical nose    SYNS3 elbow: semi-dislocation or cubital valgus spine: lumbar vertebral fusions    SYNS4  feet: symphalangism  hearing: late onset (after 40 years) conductive hearing loss   The four genes and the various mutations relating to the SYNS subtypes are listed below.   SYNS1 NOGGIN NOGGIN W205C 6  NOGGIN W217G 7  NOGGIN g58delC (Frameshift) 8  NOGGIN C232W 9     SYNS2 GDF5 GDF5 (R438L) 10initially described as representing SYNS1 10 but the phenotype is more suggestive of SYNS2 and has thus been categorized as an SYNS2 phenotype mutation 3,6   GDF5 (N445K, N445T) 11initially described as representing SYNS1 11 but the phenotype is more suggestive of SYNS2 and has thus been categorized as an SYNS2 phenotype mutation ref required   GDF5 (W414R) 3     SYNS3 FGF9 FGF9 (S99N) 12     SYNS4 GDF6 GDF6 (Y444N) 5    Additionally, some patients with features of SYNS additionally have craniosynostosis 13.

__label__Central __label__Nervous __label__System Multiple system atrophy (MSA) is a sporadic neurodegenerative disease (one of the synucleinopathies) characterized by varying degrees of cerebellar ataxia, autonomic dysfunction, parkinsonism and corticospinal dysfunction.  On this page:  Article: Epidemiology Clinical presentation Pathology Radiographic features Treatment and prognosis Related articles References   Images:Cases and figures  EpidemiologyMultiple systemic atrophy is a sporadic disease, with a prevalence of 4 per 100,000 2. Typically symptoms begin between 40 and 60 years of age 2. Clinical presentationClinical presentation is variable, but typically presents in one of three patterns (initially described as separate entities) 1,2:  Shy-Drager syndrome is used when autonomic symptoms predominate  striatonigral degeneration shows predominant parkinsonian features  olivopontocerebellar atrophy demonstrates primarily cerebellar dysfunction In a 2007 consensus paper 6 MSA has been divided clinically into two forms according to the dominant non-autonomic symptoms:   MSA-C: predominance of cerebellar symptoms (olivopontocerebellar atrophy)  MSA-P: predominance of parkinsonian signs and symptoms (striatonigral degeneration) Some older texts refer to MSA-A to denote Shy-Drager syndrome. In the latest consensus however autonomic symptoms are considered part of both MSA-C and MSA-P and thus the term MSA-A is no longer used.PathologyLike other synucleinopathies, multiple systemic atrophy results from abnormalities of alpha-synuclein metabolism, resulting in intracellular deposition. Unlike Parkinson disease and Lewy body dementia (two other synucleinopathies) these intracellular deposits are found not only in neurons but also in oligodendroglia 2. Radiographic featuresMRI is the modality of choice for imaging patients with suspected multiple system atrophy (MSA).MRI  T2: hyperintensities typically present in the pontocerebellar tracts pons: hot cross bun sign (MSA-C) middle cerebellar peduncles cerebellum    putaminal findings in MSA-P 5: reduced volume reduced GRE and T2 signal relative to globus pallidus reduced GRE and T2 signal relative to the red nucleus abnormally high T2 linear rim surrounding the putamen (putaminal rim sign), seen at 1.5 T (this is normal at 3 T) 7 (see case 3)   MSA-Cdisproportionate atrophy of the cerebellum and brainstem (especially olivary nuclei and middle cerebellar peduncle)  ADC values: higher in the pons, cerebellum, and putamen than in Parkinson disease or controls fractional anisotropy (FA): lower in the pons, cerebellum, and putamen than in Parkinson disease or controls Nuclear medicineOn SPECT/CT with I-123 ioflupane, there is loss of the normal comma- or crescent-shaped tracer uptake in the striatum. Instead, a period- or oval-shaped uptake is seen within the caudate nucleus head without tracer uptake in the putamen. Quantitative assessment reveals reduced uptake in the putamen compared to norms.Treatment and prognosisUnfortunately, no effective treatment is currently available. The disease progresses relentlessly culminating in death usually within 10 years of diagnosis 2. 
__label__Central __label__Nervous __label__System The Parkinsonian type of multiple system atrophy, previously known as striatonigral degeneration, is a neurodegenerative disease, and one of the manifestations of multiple systemic atrophy (MSA). On this page:  Article: Terminology Clinical presentation Radiographic features Related articles References   Images:Cases and figures  TerminologyIt is important to note that the current belief that olivopontocerebellar degeneration, Shy-Drager syndrome and striatonigral degeneration are different manifestations of the same underlying disease, namely multiple systemic atrophy (MSA), is recent, and as such many older publications will describe these as separate entities 1,2.For a discussion of epidemiology and pathology, please refer to multiple systemic atrophy (MSA).Clinical presentationStriatonigral degeneration presents predominantly with parkinsonism with mild cerebellar and pyramidal and signs. As such it is classified within the MSA-P subtype of MSA.Unlike Shy-Drager syndrome and olivopontocerebellar degeneration (OPCD) (the other two manifestations of MSA), autonomic dysfunction and ataxia and bulbar symptoms are less prominent.Radiographic featuresMRIPutaminal findings in MSA-P 3: reduced volume reduced GRE and T2 signal relative to globus pallidus reduced GRE and T2 signal relative to the red nucleus  putaminal rim sign: abnormal high T2 linear rim surrounding the putamen is seen at 1.5 T 3 importantly this is a normal finding at 3 T and thus should not be relied upon at a higher field strength 4

__label__Central __label__Nervous __label__System Murray Valley encephalitis (MVE), also known as Australian encephalitis, is one of many viral encephalitides and Flavivirus encephalitides, resulting from infection with the Murray Valley encephalitis virus. On this page:  Article: Clinical presentation Pathology Radiographic features Treatment and prognosis History and etymology Differential diagnosis Related articles References   Images:Imaging differential diagnosis  Clinical presentationMost patients have non-specific viral prodromal symptoms for approximately one week, including fevers, headache, nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, and generalized macular rash 1-3. This is followed by the emergence of neurological features, such as confusion and generalized or focal seizures 1-3.These neurological features then progress in one of four distinct clinical courses: relentless progression (with parkinsonism, progressive motor decline, and stupor) to death 1-3  prominent spinal cord involvement (a poliomyelitis-like syndrome) 1-3  cranial nerve and brainstem involvement with tremor 1-3  encephalitis followed by complete recovery 1-3  PathologyThe causative agent is Murray valley encephalitis virus (MVEV), a single-stranded RNA flavivirus. Mosquitos and wild waterbirds, especially in the northern regions of Australia and in Papua New Guinea, are reservoirs for the virus, which is then spread by mosquitoes 1-3. Importantly, only 0.01-0.06% of patients with MVEV infection develop MVE 1.The virus endemically spreads to more south-eastern regions of Australia, such as the Murray Valley regions, after extreme climate events that cause subsequent flooding of the Murray River and creation of ideal habitats for mosquitos that carry MVEV 1-3. Radiographic featuresSymmetric early bilateral thalami involvement with later extension into the brain stem is classical regardless of CT or MRI imaging 1,3,4. Less commonly, the temporal lobes and cervical spinal cord may also be involved, depending on the clinical course 1.CTLesions may be subtle on CT but are most often hypodense involving the thalami and extending down into the brainstem as the disease progresses 1,3. These lesions often exert local mass-effect, and may result in obstructive hydrocephalus 1,3.MRIMRI is the imaging modality of choice, however, is often unavailable due to the rurality of the regions affected by MVE, and thus MRI features are scarcely described in the literature 1,4.However, the most striking features reported are symmetric high T2-weighted signal intensities classically affecting the thalami bilaterally and extending down into the brainstem 1,3,4. These lesions also demonstrate low signal on T1 with variable contrast enhancement and usually demonstrate high diffusion signal on DWI although this is likely due to T2 shine through as ADC maps are often isointense 4. As with CT, obstructive hydrocephalus secondary to mass-effect may also be noted 1.Treatment and prognosisThere is no specific antiviral treatment available for MVE, and thus supportive management (e.g. antiepileptics, corticosteroids) is encouraged 1. Mortality is thought to be between 15-30%, with an additional 30-50% of patients having long-term neurological complications 1.History and etymologyMVE was first formally recognized in Australia after an epidemic in 1951 in the Murray Valley region of Victoria 1.Differential diagnosisOther causes of a similar imaging pattern include toxic leukoencephalopathy, eastern equine encephalitis, and other Flavivirus encephalitides: Japanese encephalitis West Nile fever St. Louis encephalitis

__label__Musculoskeletal Muscle hernias, also known as myofascial defects, are most commonly found in the lower extremities, and represent a focal defect in the muscle fascia with protrusion of muscle through the defect. Muscle hernias may be found occasionally in the upper extremities and may be single or multiple. The most commonly involved muscle is the tibialis anterior. Clinical presentationMuscle hernias are typically asymptomatic, although can cause cramping sensations or pain with or after activity. They may also present as a palpable mass, and be referred for imaging to evaluate for neoplasia. The mass may not be palpable when the patient is relaxed, which is a clinical clue to the diagnosis. Radiographic featuresUltrasoundUltrasound is the modality of choice in the evaluation of suspected muscle hernia, although MRI may be ordered if there is suspicion of neoplasia. Light pressure examination is preferable, so as not to reduce or efface the herniation. Contraction of the involved muscle may reveal or accentuate the lesion.The hernia is often hypoechoic to the surrounding muscle and may assume a mushroom shape as it protrudes through and over the fascial defect (the defect is of the deep layer of the deep fascia.) It may thin or elevate the superficial layer of the deep fascia that overlies the muscle. MRI better visualization of muscle demarcation  quantification of fascial defect quantification of herniated muscle confirmation of defect

__label__Musculoskeletal Muscle tears or strains are common injuries, both in athletes and non-athletes.  On this page:  Article: Terminology Pathology Radiographic features References   Images:Cases and figures  TerminologyMuscle strain is a term that is used variably clinically and in the medical literature. The Munich consensus statement (expert level evidence) states muscle tear is the preferred term denoting "structural injuries of muscle fibers/bundles leading to loss of continuity and contractile properties" 1. PathologyMuscles tears are an indirect muscle injury that occurs in eccentric contraction during sprinting or stretching 2. Most commonly these injuries occur at the myotendinous junction (MTJ) but can also be peripheral (i.e. myofascial) 3. LocationThe lower limbs are most of at risk of injury, with biceps femoris the most commonly injured followed by rectus femoris and gastrocnemius muscles 2,3.Radiographic featuresUltrasoundUltrasound examination may be normal or in low-grade injuries demonstrate focal or diffuse regions of increased echogenicity. Fiber disruption is characterized by well-defined hypoechoic/anechoic regions. Disruption at the myofascial junction or myotendinous junction may be present 1. MRIMRI features corresponding to clinical grades of injury are 1:  grade 1: T2 high signal with a feathery appearance (usually centered on the MTJ) representing edema +/- thickened and high signal of the intramuscular tendon but without laxity +/- mild perifascial fluid  grade 2: above features with fiber disruption characterized by high T2 signal and local distortion +/- intramuscular tendon high signal with or without thickening, laxity or partial disruption +/- moderate-severe perifascial fluid  grade 3: complete disruption +/- retraction/laxity with local hematoma

__label__Musculoskeletal Musculoskeletal ultrasound is a musculoskeletal imaging technique that adds a different and complementary dimension of imaging evaluation to the traditional modalities of plain radiography, computerized tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).Recognized advantages of the modality include the ready availability of ultrasound equipment, the relatively low cost of the procedure compared with advanced imaging such as CT and MRI, and that the exam uses non-ionizing radiation.Other advantages of the modality include an ability to image patients with a contraindication to MRI (e.g., patients with some types of pacemakers) and that ultrasound experiences much less artifact when imaging patients with surgical hardware.Musculoskeletal ultrasound also allows dynamic evaluation of patients, which can improve the radiologic interpretation of the clinical relevance of findings seen in a static image (e.g. shoulder impingement).  Standard high-frequency ultrasound probes also resolve finer imaging detail than many types of clinical musculoskeletal MRI. The axial resolution of a 10 MHz probe is 150 μm. A 1.5 T MRI scanner with a field of view of 12 x 6 cm and a matrix of 256 x 256 pixels, with a slice thickness of 0.5 cm has a resolution of 469 x 469 μm.1Despite its many strengths, however, musculoskeletal ultrasound also has some limitations in the complete evaluation of musculoskeletal disorders. Radiography and CT provide much better evaluation of mineralization and the spatial relationship of fractures. MRI is invaluable for assessment of bone marrow, bone tumors, and joints and muscles that aren't accessible to high resolution ultrasound probes (e.g. the spine, the sacroiliac joints, the cruciate ligaments). Musculoskeletal ultrasound also encounters its own set of artifacts, such as anisotropy, and requires a solid knowledge base and background in ultrasound technique for safe and accurate results.

Weight loss has been described. Clinical features are consistent with other forms of hypersensitivity pneumonitis and as is typical, removal of the patient from the allergenic environment causes resolution of symptoms. Countries vary in the species of fungi commercially grown which has led to various subtypes of disease based on the species and agricultural methods being described.Radiological featuresCXR and chest CT show typical features of hypersensitivity pneumonitis which may progress to fibrosis. Radiographic resolution is expected following the removal of the patient from the allergenic environment.
__label__Cardiac __label__Paediatrics The Mustard repair is a technique to correct transposition of the great arteries (TGA), and involves: resection of atrial septum creation of an atrial baffle with pericardium (or rarely synthetic material) 1  RationaleTransposition of the great arteries involves a discordance between the ventricles and their respective great arteries.The Mustard repair is an attempt to correct this at the atrial level.The Senning repair is functionally similar to the Mustard repair, but uses the atrial septum itself as a baffle, rather than using pericardium or synthetic material.The arterial switch procedure is now more commonly used than either the Mustard or Senning repairs. It functionally provides an arterial rather than an atrial "switch" and anatomically corrects the abnormality. This is done partly to avoid the long-term complication of arrhythmia.ComplicationsStenosis of the baffle occurs in up to 13% of cases 2 and the extensive atrial incisions results in intra-atrial conduction delays and possible arrhythmias 3.
__label__Central __label__Nervous __label__System __label__Paediatrics Myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome or ME/CFS, is a complex organic disorder, characterized by profound fatigue and associated marked impairment of both physical and mental functioning. Its underlying etiology is undetermined and a curative treatment remains elusive. On this page:  Article: Terminology Epidemiology Clinical presentation Pathology Radiographic features References   TerminologyIn 1934, following the first reports of this new mysterious condition it was named neuromyasthenia. In 1959, it was renamed benign myalgic encephalomyelitis as it began to be thought of as an inflammatory disorder. The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the US in 1987 created a working group, which after much discussion about its nomenclature settled upon the new term "chronic fatigue syndrome". However myalgic encephalomyelitis was internationally in such widespread use by this point, that the condition became known as myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS), its current preferred monicker 4.EpidemiologyMyalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome is a worldwide endemic condition and the majority of cases are sporadic in nature although occasionally outbreaks of clustered cases are seen 1. Its prevalence has been estimated as much as 0.5-1% of the adult population.ME/CFS is seen in all ages, ethnicities and socioeconomic strata. There are two spikes in time of onset, in the second and fourth decades. In teenagers, females predominate 3-4:1. It is thought that as many as 91% of adult patients have not been diagnosed according to accepted criteria 1.Clinical presentationA cardinal feature of myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome is an aggravation of symptoms by even the most minor of physical and/or mental efforts. These symptoms then often may remain for hours, days or weeks despite adequate rest. severe debilitating fatigue and lassitude cognitive disturbances: poor concentration, impaired short term memory, often called "brain fog" disturbed sleep myalgia and arthralgia neurological symptoms autonomic symptoms  orthostatic intolerance (OI) is common thermoregulation dysfunction: hypersensitivity to high/low temperatures, low core body temperature   immune dysregulation GI symptoms: abdominal discomfort, nausea, loss of appetite PathologyEtiologyThe cause of myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome is not known but is thought to be multifactorial.It is thought to be a physical illness, not least due to demonstrable biophysical changes. Secondary psychological sequelae may be seen, as in any other chronic disease process 1. Radiographic featuresImaging for myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome per se is usually normal. However, imaging may be important when patients present with troubling neurological deficits and other serious diseases of the CNS need to be excluded 1. Structural and functional neuroimaging have demonstrated changes in the brain 3.Many myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome patients may have decreased heart size on imaging, e.g. decreased cardiothoracic ratio (CTR) on chest radiographs 2.
__label__Musculoskeletal __label__Chest Myasthenia gravis (MG) is the most common neuromuscular junction disease and presents with weakness worsened by exertion but improving with rest.  On this page:  Article: Epidemiology Clinical presentation Pathology Treatment and prognosis References   Images:Cases and figures  EpidemiologyIncidence is estimated at 15-20 per 100,000 1,2. Females are more affected (3:1) under the age of 40, but males are more affected by the age of 50 2. Clinical presentationThe classic feature of myasthenia gravis is fluctuating weakness that is fatiguable, worsening with activity and improving with rest 2. Two-thirds of patients present with ocular symptoms (e.g. diplopia, ptosis), with the majority (80%) proceeding to experience generalized weakness 1. PathologyMyasthenia gravis is an autoimmune disease. The disease can be associated with several antibodies. These include: AChR Ab: antibodies affecting postsynaptic acetylcholine receptors MuSK Ab: antibodies affecting muscle specific kinase  titin Ab RyR Ab Associations  thymic lymphoid hyperplasia may be seen in around 65% of cases with myasthenia gravis 8    thymoma 3 ~40% of patients with thymoma have myasthenia gravis 10-15% of patients with myasthenia gravis have a thymoma   other autoimmune diseases, e.g. thyroiditis, rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus 5   myocarditis 5  Treatment and prognosisSymptomatic treatment with cholinesterase inhibitors (e.g. pyridostigmine) are first line treatment in myasthenia gravis. Severe cases usually require plasmapharesis or immunoglobulin therapy. Corticosteroids and immunosuppressive drugs (e.g. cyclosporin, cyclophosphamide, azathioprine and mycophenolate mofetil) are used for immunomodulation in the chronic setting of the disease 2,6. Thymectomy for patients with a thymoma is usually recommended 2.Patients with myasthenia gravis can present with a sudden worsening of symptoms termed a myasthenic crisis which can compromise the respiratory muscles in some cases. This can be precipitated by concurrent infection or medication use (e.g. aminoglycosides) 2.

Endemic areas with the highest prevalence are seen in tropical and subtropical regions ("mycetoma belt"), including 3, 4: Indian subcontinent (Madurella mycetomatis dominates) Africa (Streptomyces somaliensis dominates) Central and South America (Nocardia brasiliensis dominates) Most commonly affected are young adults, 20-40 years of age. There is male preponderance, explained by occupational exposure to outdoor environment (colonized soil and plants).  Infection may also occur in travelers to endemic areas unaware of or ignoring advices 3, 4. Predisposing factors include 3 ,4: low socioeconomic status occupations with risk for contact such as farming lack of protective clothing or shoes Clinical presentationGiven the slow disease progression, painless nature and low socioeconomic status of the most often affected patients, presentation is usually late. The classical triad of painless soft-tissue swelling, draining sinuses and purulent discharge is considered pathognomonic.‎Common sites of initial or extended infection are ‎the extremities, back, and gluteal region.‎PathologyInfection occurs by saprophytes colonizing soil or plants (see above), inoculating via a site of minor trauma, most often in the foot and facilitated by a lack of protective clothing or shoes (bare-footed). Initial infection progresses to chronic granulomatous infection with development of the characterizing triad of abscesses, draining sinuses and discharging grains in its course. Opportunistic suprainfection and/or destruction of adjacent bony and visceral structures may also occur.Usually infection remains localized but it may rarely disseminate and involve any organ 5.DefinitionsMycetomas are subdivided by their causative agents eumycetoma or eumycotic mycetomaetiologic agent fungimost often Madurella mycetomatis (maduromycosis)    actinomycetoma or actinomycotic mycetomaetiologic agent filamentous bacteria most often Nocardia brasiliensis and  Streptomyces somaliensis     DiagnosisDiagnosis is yielded by microscopic examination of grains (either in purulent discharges or by biopsy), which is essential to perform antimicrobial susceptibility testing for treatment options.Radiographic featuresImaging may provide mapping of local disease extension or reveal additional sites of infection 5.For imaging appearances see maduromycosis.Treatment and prognosisPossible deformation and loss of function may eventually be fatal. Treatment means are usually conservative and directed to causing agents, however, the frequently encountered late presentation often necessitates surgery, e.g. amputation.See also Madura foot aspergilloma 
__label__Chest Mycobacterium bovis is a member of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex and an obligate aerobe bacterium that is the cause of tuberculosis in cattle. M. bovis can also cause tuberculosis in other mammals including humans. On this page:  Article: Epidemiology Pathology Treatment and prognosis Related articles References   EpidemiologyIn the United States, M. bovis accounts for ~ 2% of all new tuberculosis cases, with similar figures in The Netherlands (1.4%).PathologyAs a zoonosis, human infection with M. bovis usually occurs by way of infected milk, although droplet infection is possible.Infections in humans are rare because of pasteurisation of milk and dairy, and because infected cattle are normally culled immediately. In countries where pasteurisation is not routinely undertaken, M. bovis is a relatively common cause of tuberculosis.Rarely, human-to-cattle and human-to-human infection can occur as during a 2004 outbreak in Birmingham (United Kingdom) amongst nightclub patrons, the index case having drunk unpasteurised milk.Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) is a live attenuated strain of Mycobacterium bovis.Treatment and prognosisM. bovis is inherently resistant to pyrazinamide. The standard treatment consists of combination isoniazid and rifampin.
__label__Chest Mycobacterium tuberculosis is a thin, slightly curved bacillus. A member of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex, it is an obligate aerobic bacterium that is the etiologic agent of the majority of tuberculosis cases.  On this page:  Article: Epidemiology Pathology Diagnosis Treatment and prognosis History and etymology Related articles References   EpidemiologyThe worldwide incidence of tuberculosis was 8.7 million in 2011 (13% of these were coinfected with HIV). The mortality in 2011 was 1.4 million, of which 430,000 cases were HIV-positive. Despite these persistently high figures, The WHO Millennium Development Goal target to halt and reverse the TB epidemic by 2015 has already been achieved.The worldwide incidence has been falling for several years now, at a rate of 2.2% between 2010 and 2011. The mortality rate has decreased 41% since 1990 and the world is on track to achieve the global target of a 50% reduction by 2015, however, the African and European regions are not on track to achieve that goal.PathologyThe wall of the bacterium contains high levels of lipids, and as such does not retain standard bacteriological stains such as Gram stain. Despite this characteristic, M. tuberculosis is classified as a Gram-positive bacterium due to the lack of an outer cell membrane. The division rate of M. tuberculosis is very slow at up to 20 hours. The lipid-rich wall accounts for its capacity to survive in a dry condition for many weeks, and for its virulence. Microscopy Ziehl-Neelsen or acid-fast stains are used. M. tuberculosis appears as small round bacilli stained red by the acid-fast stain. Caseating granulomas containing Langhans giant cells (not to be confused with Langerhans cells) is a hallmark.PathophysiologyM. tuberculosis is transmitted airborne, i.e. by droplet infection. M. tuberculosis is a facultative intracellular parasite. When inhaled, the organism is taken up by alveolar macrophages. Several mechanisms stop macrophages from killing the bacteria, and hence they can multiply unhindered within macrophages. From the lungs, spread to other organs is haematogenous. Pulmonary tuberculosis is contagious, non-pulmonary tuberculosis is not.At-risk groups for infection are: immunocompromised including HIV infection, diabetes, long-term immunosuppressants close contact with others with active TB malnourishment, alcoholism and intravenous drug use patient from endemic countries workers and residents in long-term residential facilities including jails, nursing homes, care homes. DiagnosisThe Mantoux tuberculin skin test involves the subdermal injection of tuberculin, a complex of purified M. tuberculosis proteins, into the skin of the forearm. The size of the developing skin reaction is measured in millimeters. A positive reaction indicates that a person has been infected with TB bacteria in the past. It cannot determine whether active infection is present.Similarly, interferon-gamma release assays (IGRAs) such as QuantiFERON®-TB Gold are surrogate markers of M. tuberculosis infection and indicating an immune response to M. tuberculosis, but cannot distinguish between latent infection and active tuberculosis. These tests are not affected by prior Bacillus Calmette–Guérin (BCG) vaccination. Since 2010 the IGRAs are the preferred testing method as recommended by the CDC.To determine whether the active disease is present, a chest radiograph and sputum for culture and acid-fast stain are needed to determine whether the person has active disease.Treatment and prognosisTreatment consists of combination antibiotic therapy for at least six months. The agents isoniazid, rifampin, ethambutol, and pyrazinamide are considered first-line antituberculosis agents.Multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) is defined as disease caused by M. tuberculosis resistant to at least isoniazid and rifampin. Treatment is a challenge and involves second-line therapies for up to two years.Extensively drug-resistant TB (XDR-TB) progresses very rapidly and can be fatal within weeks. XDR-TB is defined as TB that has developed resistance to at least rifampin and isoniazid, plus any agent of the fluoroquinolone family, plus at least one of the aminoglycosides or polypeptides.PreventionIsolation of cases, improve ventilation and vaccination with BCG in endemic countries (this vaccine has good efficiency in children only).History and etymology 2400 BCE: evidence of spinal tuberculosis in an Egyptian mummy 460 BCE: Hippocrates termed the condition phthisis (Greek for consumption), a term used throughout the centuries 1720: Benjamin Marten writes "A theory of Consumption" and hypothesizes that tuberculosis may be caused by "small living creatures that are transmitted through the air to other patients" 1854: dissertation by Hermann Brehmer entitled “Tuberculosis is a Curable Disease” 1882: discovery of M. tuberculosis by Robert Koch wins the 1905 Nobel Prize 1921: Bacillus Calmette–Guérin (BCG) vaccine first used in humans 1944: discovery of streptomycin by Selwan Waxman  1998: genome of M. tuberculosis sequenced

In adults, mycoplasma can rarely result in a bronchiolitis without giving a pneumonia.PathologyM. pneumoniae is the smallest organism which can be cultured in vitro and lacks a cell wall, hence it is resistant to the penicillins. It spreads via inhalation of aerosolized droplets containing the microorganisms. It initially involves the peribronchovascular interstitium and then extends to the adjacent alveoli.Extrapulmonary manifestations: headache  arthropathy  immune hemolytic anemia  pericarditis and myocarditis  meningoencephalitis  transverse myelitis Guillain-Barre syndrome Stevens-Johnson syndrome Radiographic featuresPlain radiographThere can be variable chest radiographic features, although four different patterns have been described 1.  No pattern is, however, pathognomonic: peribronchial and perivascular interstitial infiltrates - reticular densities most common ~49% (can be patchy with a segmental or non-segmental distribution) airspace consolidation ~38% reticulonodular opacification ~8% nodular or mass-like opacification ~5%.  Bilateral peribronchial perivascular interstitial infiltrates in central and middle lung zones have also been described. Lower lobes are most commonly involved. Other reported plain film findings include bilateral lesions, pleural effusion (uncommon - in ~25% of cases) and hilar lymphadenopathy.CTAreas of ground-glass attenuation and air-space consolidation have been reported as being frequent on HRCT (~80% of cases 2)In about 60% of cases, areas of consolidation may have a lobular distribution evident on CT. Intrapulmonary nodules can also be seen (~90% of cases) and these tend to have a predominantly centrilobular distribution 3. Other findings include thickening of the bronchovascular bundles.Treatment and prognosisMost patients recover well although a small proportion of patients may develop bronchiectasis in the affected region or Swyer James syndrome.

__label__Spine __label__Central __label__Nervous __label__System Myelography is a form of imaging intended to evaluate the subarachnoid spaces within the spinal canal. It is now usually performed with either CT or MR imaging of the spine after injection of an intrathecal iodinated or gadolinium-based contrast agent. MR myelography may also provide evaluation without the need for intrathecal gadolinium by utilizing specific fluid-sensitive acquisition techniques.Although conventional (i.e. fluoroscopic) myelography has been largely supplanted by modern CT and (especially) MRI of the spine, it remains a useful tool in the evaluation of spondylosis.  CT myelography is especially useful in those patients who cannot undergo MRI.HistoryThe concept of using a contrast agent to better image the contents of the spinal canal originated as an extension of pneumoencephalography, wherein air was instilled into the subarachnoid space to provide "negative" contrast for evaluating structures of the brain. Although crude, requiring extraction of an equivalent volume of cerebrospinal fluid to instilled air, and extremely painful, air-contrast myelography (or pneumomyelography) techniques allowed some visualization of the intraspinal soft tissues as imaged by fluoroscopy.In the 1920 and 1930s, myelography using 'positive' liquid contrast agents became more common. Initial agents included oil-based compounds such as Lipiodol®, and water-soluble compounds, such as Thorotrast®, and Abrodil®. Iophendylate (Pantopaque) was a popular myelography agent until the 1970s. An oil-based agent, it was not readily reabsorbed and thus often remained trapped within the subarachnoid spaces for decades 4. As with many of its pharmacological predecessors, it was notorious for causing arachnoiditis. It was withdrawn from clinical use in 1988 4.

There is no recognized gender predilection.Myeloid sarcoma may develop during the course of a hematologic disorder but is seen to precede the disorder in 35% of cases.PathologyMyeloid sarcoma lesions are composed of immature myeloid elements and therefore represent focal accumulations of leukemic cells. In contrast to its associated entities, the lesion takes the form of a solid soft tissue mass that effaces the underlying involved tissue architecture (cf. leukemic infiltrates).They can occur with or without relation to other forms of myeloid disorders 10:  de novo: with no prior history of myeloproliferative and myelodysplastic disorders simultaneously with a myeloproliferative and myelodysplastic disorder: concomitant peripheral blood and marrow involvement as a relapse of a treated myeloproliferative and myelodysplastic disorder as a form of blast transformation from a prior myeloproliferative neoplasm LocationExtramedullary involvement is a defining feature.Almost any tissue can be affected, with skin and bone being the commonest.

__label__Haematology __label__Oncology Myeloproliferative neoplasms are a diverse group of conditions that are characterized by an excess of terminally differentiated myeloid cells (red cells, white cells, and/or platelets) in the peripheral blood.PathologyClassificationThe classic four types of myeloproliferative neoplasms are the following: primary myelofibrosis polycythemia vera essential thrombocythaemia chronic myeloid leukemia According to the World Health Organization classification, there are additional entities categorized under myeloproliferative neoplasms: chronic neutrophilic leukemia chronic eosinophilic leukemia, not otherwise specified In contrast to the latter category, there is a separately defined category of myeloid/lymphoid neoplasms associated with eosinophilia characterized by specific gene arrangements (see below).Some additional conditions demonstrate overlap of features of myeloproliferative neoplasms and myelodysplastic syndromes: chronic myelomonocytic leukemia  atypical chronic myeloid leukemia, BCR-ABL1-negative juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasm with ring sideroblasts and thrombocytosis myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasm, unclassifiable GeneticsChronic myeloid leukemia is caused by a reciprocal translocation between chromosomes 9 and 22, creating the fusion gene BCR-ABL1. The shortened chromosome 22 containing the fusion gene is called the Philadelphia chromosome.All patients with polycythemia vera and a majority of patients with primary myelofibrosis and essential thrombocytopenia have a gain-of-function mutation in JAK2, which encodes a tyrosine kinase. The most common mutation in patients with polycythemia vera results in substitution of valine for phenylalanine in a negative regulatory domain (V617F). Most of the remaining minority of patients with primary myelofibrosis and essential thrombocythemia have a mutation in the CALR or MPL genes.Known gene rearrangements associated with myeloproliferative causes of hypereosinophilia involve PDGFRA, PDGFRB, FGFR1, or PCM1-JAK2.Radiographic featuresPatients may present radiologically with thrombosis or bleeding 4. Unexplained splanchnic vein thrombosis, involving the hepatic veins (Budd-Chiari syndrome) or portal vein, is quite commonly associated with myeloproliferative neoplasms (particularly polycythemia vera and essential thrombocythemia) and should prompt testing for JAK2 V617F 5. Osseous changes are particularly seen in primary myelofibrosis secondary to marrow infiltration, manifest on MRI as abnormally low T1 signal, on radiographs as osteosclerosis, and on bone scintigraphy as diffusely increased skeletal uptake (superscan)Splenomegaly is common but non-specific. As peripheral blood count abnormalities may sometimes be masked by hypersplenism, other secondary radiologic findings may be the only clue to an occult myeloproliferative neoplasm. The most common solid lesion is extramedullary hematopoiesis, which can appear as masses in the spleen, liver, or paravertebral tissues.

On this page:  Article: Terminology Epidemiology Differential diagnosis References   TerminologyThey are usually defined as invaginations penetrating >50% of the thickness of adjoining compact myocardium usually perpendicular to the long axis of the left ventricle, tending to narrow or occlude in systole and without local hypokinesia or dyskinesia 5.EpidemiologyWhile they can be present in the normal population but increasingly common in those with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and hypertensive cardiomyopathy 3.Differential diagnosisPossible imaging differential considerations include: left ventricular pseudoaneurysm left ventricular aneurysm left ventricular diverticulum

__label__Cardiac Myocardial infarction (MI), an acute coronary syndrome, results from interruption of myocardial blood flow and resultant ischemia and is a leading cause of death worldwide.  On this page:  Article: Epidemiology Clinical presentation Pathology Radiographic features References   Images:Cases and figures  EpidemiologyRisk factors male > females age >45 years for males >55 years for females   cardiovascular risk factors: smoking, hypertension, LDL cholesterol, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, obesity, physical inactivity, air pollution positive family history: a history of first-degree male relative (i.e. brother, father, son) with MI <55 years of age or first-degree female relative (i.e. mother, sister, daughter) with MI <65 years of age Clinical presentation chest pain/tightness, which may radiate down the left arm or into the jaw "silent" ischemia can occur in those with poor visceral sensation (diabetics, post-cardiothoracic surgery) and may manifest with other symptoms of myocardial compromise, e.g. breathlessness Laboratory markersThe mainstay of diagnosis revolves around cardiac biomarkers: high-sensitivity troponin (and previously creatine kinase MB (CK-MB)) and electrocardiogram findings.ECGFindings on the ECG depending on the coronary artery involved. In a typical right dominant system, classic patterns include:  proximal left anterior descending artery occlusion produces an "extensive anterior MI" pattern, with ST-segment elevation in precordial leads V1-6 and limb leads I and aVL reciprocal ST-segment depression in lead III   mid-left anterior descending artery occlusion produces an "apical MI" pattern, with ST-segment elevation in precordial leads V3-6 and most of the limb leads elevation in lead II > III leads III and aVL both elevated (usually show reciprocity)   reciprocal ST-segment depression in lead aVR   proximal right coronary artery occlusion usually produces an "inferior MI" pattern, with ST-segment elevation in limb leads II, III, and aVF reciprocal ST-segment depression in lead I and aVL associated right ventricular MI denoted by elevation of the ST segment in III>II and V1>V2 associated posterior MI pattern has tall right (V1-3) precordial R waves with horizontal ST depression and tall, upright T waves     left circumflex artery occlusion usually produces a "high lateral wall MI" pattern, with ST-segment elevation in limb leads I and aVL reciprocal ST-segment depression in lead III   PathologyCoronary artery disease with rupture of an atherosclerotic plaque resulting in occlusion (local thrombosis/dissection) is the major cause of myocardial infarctions. Other causes include 12: ischemic imbalance (i.e. myocardial oxygen supply/demand imbalance) in critically-ill patients or in the setting of major (non-cardiac) surgery vasospasm   iatrogenic, e.g. during revascularization procedures Types The most commonly used method of classification is as follows:  type I: spontaneous MI related to ischemia from a primary coronary event (e.g., plaque rupture, thrombotic occlusion)  type II: secondary to ischemia from a supply-and-demand mismatch (e.g. sepsis, hypotension, tachyarrhythmia, anemia)  type III: MI resulting in sudden cardiac death  type IV:  type IVa: is an MI associated with percutaneous coronary intervention  type IVb: associated with in-stent thrombosis    type V: MI associated with coronary artery bypass surgery. LocationThe heart is supplied by three main coronary arteries. Thus, hypoperfusion patterns usually follow a territorial pattern:  right coronary artery: supplies the thin (3 mm) walled right ventricle; this artery is dominant in 70% of patients, meaning that this artery supplies the inferior heart and posterior interventricular septum via the posterior descending artery   left anterior descending artery: supplies the anterior part of the left ventricle and the anterior aspect of the interventricular septum  circumflex artery: supplies the lateral and posterior aspect of the left ventricle; in 10% of patients, this artery is dominant, meaning that it supplies the inferior heart and posterior interventricular septum For a more in-depth discussion of coronary dominance, see the article coronary arterial dominance.Radiographic featuresSecondary tests such as nuclear medicine (hot sestamibi) and echocardiography (localized hypokinesis) are used to aid in the diagnosis in some patients.Given various advances in cardiac imaging such as: ECG gating dual source (effectively halving the rotation time of the tube) increasing detector area (256-row and 320-row single-source CT systems), allowing the entire heart to be scanned in 1 rotation (at significantly lower radiation doses - as low as 1 mSv in prospective ECG-triggered scanning) 6  CT scanning has the potential to play a central role in the investigation of chest pain. Apart from being able to detect large territory infarcts on coronary CT angiography (CTA), CT has the added advantage of being able to diagnose other causes of chest pain (e.g. pulmonary embolism, aortic dissection, pneumonia), in a protocol known as “triple rule-out” CTA.Plain radiographUseful in excluding other causes of chest pain, e.g. pneumonia. Less useful in the direct diagnosis of myocardial infarction. The cardio-mediastinal contours are usually normal. One may occasionally see signs of heart failure.CTCT coronary angiogramMost of the studies evaluating the usefulness of CT imaging have used 64 multislice CT scanning with ECG gating to assess the lumen of coronary arteries. Using this technique, a sensitivity of 92% and specificity of 76% was achieved, even in patients who were initially ECG and troponin negative 2."Triple rule-out” coronary CT angiographySome institutions are using this protocol that examines for not only coronary artery disease, but also aortic dissection, pulmonary embolism, and other chest diseases. While there is a consensus about this protocol offering advantages in evaluating emergency department patients presenting with symptoms consistent with an acute coronary syndrome, there is an ongoing debate about proper indications. It should not be used routinely and lacks demonstration of increasing efficiency of resource use 10,11.See triple-rule-out CT.CT perfusionIn patients who have established coronary artery narrowing, CT perfusion can be used to predict the significance of the luminal narrowing as well as predicting post-infarction myocardial viability/salvageability 3-4.An acute myocardial infarct would manifest with a reduced first-pass effect (hypodense myocardium). A CT thoracic aortogram is in effect a cardiac first-pass perfusion study (albeit, without the ECG gating) and has the potential to detect large territory myocardial infarcts. Despite these described findings, the role of CT perfusion in assessing acute myocardial infarction has not been well established. An established myocardial infarct would manifest with: delayed enhancement (7-15 minutes post-CT contrast dose) 4  delayed peak enhancement occurs slightly later compared to normal myocardium 12.8 versus 11.6 seconds 8  peak enhancement is lowest in infarcts (26 HU) versus ischemia (36 HU) versus normal myocardium (58 HU) 8  Infarct scars can mimic acute myocardial infarcts as they demonstrate a similar enhancement pattern; however, old infarcts are often associated with myocardial thinning and contour abnormality (bulges away from ventricle), useful distinguishing features. One study has assessed the utility of non-ECG-gated 16 slices CT pulmonary angiogram in detecting myocardial infarct. This method suffers from a few problems. Firstly, the relatively early (cf. with CT aortogram/coronary angiogram) phase results in non-homogeneous enhancement of the myocardium. Secondly, streak artefact (consider saline chaser) from the undiluted contrast in the SVC/right atrium caused "pseudo areas" of reduced myocardial attenuation. Thirdly, movement artefact from the beating heart caused areas of increased/decreased attenuation. Despite these problems, this study published optimistic figures of 66.6% (sensitivity) and 91.4% (specificity) 5. Approaches using dual-energy CT to visualize late myocardial enhancement as a marker for scars showed only a limited diagnostic value in comparison to MRI 7.AngiographyDigital subtraction angiography will show luminal arterial compromise. Primary percutaneous coronary intervention (primary PCI) with angioplasty and stenting is the gold standard for the treatment of ST-elevation myocardial infarct. Patients with non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction also commonly undergo coronary angiography as inpatients.MRIRecent advances in MRI have made it possible to assess myocardial infarction in patients with acute chest pain as well as those with subacute or chronic disease. Using different MR signals and techniques provides valuable information on assessing the scar tissue as well as salvageable myocardium.In the acute phase of infarction, myocardial edema can be seen as T2 weighted high signal regions. It has been shown that these regions are salvageable. These segments of the myocardium are called "myocardium at risk".Perfusion MRI at rest and during a vasodilator stress administration using a ‘first-pass' technique shows a signal increase in normal myocardium. Enhancement is limited in ischemic myocardium.Myocardial scar tissue can be identified using late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) images and is useful in differentiating infarction (subendocardial or transmural) from non-infarcted myocardium or other non-ischemic cardiomyopathies and infiltrative diseases13.PET/MRIIn those who have had a myocardial infarct, PET/MRI can be used to identify patients with potentially viable/salvageable myocardium that may be a candidate for revascularization therapy (stunned myocardium or hibernating myocardium).EchocardiographyThe first manifestation of the ischemic cascade detectable by echocardiography is diastolic dysfunction, preceding derangement of systolic function. Other features suggestive of myocardial ischemia in an appropriate clinical context include: new regional wall motion abnormalities correspond to vascular territory affected adjacent segmental hyperkinesis previously infarcted myocardium will also demonstrate wall motion abnormalities, but is characteristically thin (<7 mm or <30% the thickness of adjacent myocardium) and displays increased relative echogenicity   decreased systolic wall thickeningnormal wall thickening is >40%  tardokinesis post-systolic thickening 
__label__Cardiac Myocardial mapping or parametric mapping of the heart is one of various magnetic resonance imaging techniques, which has evolved and been increasingly used in the last decade for non-invasive tissue characterization of the myocardium 1-5. Unlike normal T1-, T2- or T2*- images, parametric mapping allows for both visualization and quantification of focal and diffuse disease 1,2,4.The technique comprises the generation of a parametric map from a series of co-registered images with different T1, T2  or T2*relaxation times, depending on the mapping technique used. The T1, T2 or T2* values of the myocardium are tissue properties and are encoded in the respective pixels of the map. With the mapping technique, they can be compared to the spared healthy myocardium in focal disease or quantified and evaluated on the basis of normal reference values in diffuse disease 1,5,22.The T1-map is generated at different degrees of longitudinal relaxation in order to receive a signal intensity vs time curve, from where T1 can be calculated. In a similar fashion, a T2 or T2*-maps are obtained from a signal intensity vs time curve on the basis of different transverse relaxation times. Different acquisition methods for each T1 and T2 quantification exist 6-8,15-17.Myocardial T1 mappingNative T1The myocardial T1-map depicts the spin-lattice (longitudinal) relaxation of the myocardium and the T1 value [ms] of a voxel represents the respective time constant for the recovery.Despite extensive research during the last 15 years, histopathological correlates of myocardial T1 values are still not completely elucidated 2. T1-mapping techniques have been studied as a key feature for the assessment of myocardial fibrosis 5,8,9,12,22. However, native T1 reflects changes in intracellular and extracellular compartments and is not only influenced by collagen, but also by protein, water (edema), lipids and iron 1-5,8,9,13,22.Myocardial T1 lengthens at higher magnetic field strength3,7 and is also influenced by various physiological factors4,7.Postcontrast T1Administration of gadolinium leads to a shortening of the T1 time. Postcontrast T1 can be measured and displayed on a map in equal measure. Since most gadolinium agents spread in the intravascular and interstitial compartments and not within the cells,  a reduced post-contrast T1 value should either reflect an expansion of the interstitial space due to collagen (myocardial fibrosis), protein (amyloidosis) or an access to the intracellular space (in case of myocardial edema or cell membrane disruption e.g. necrosis, myocardial infarction) 1,2,8,9,13,14,22.  Myocardial extracellular volume (ECV)Extracellular volume (ECV) reflects the volume fraction that is not taken by cells. It combines interstitial and intravascular space and represents approximately 25% of the myocardial volume 13. If native and post-contrast T1 images are co-registered, quantified and adjusted for hematocrit, extracellular volume(ECV) can be calculated for a specific area or for specific voxels 1,2.  Likewise, an ECV map can be generated. For this purpose postcontrast T1 should be obtained during a slow continuous infusion or at least 15 min after bolus injection 13.Applications of native T1 mappingMost diffuse cardiac disorders as diffuse fibrosis, scar tissue, and inflammation result in prolonged native myocardial T1 relaxation time1-5,8-14, it has proven especially useful in the detection of: amyloidosis acute inflammation acute ischemia necrosis A few cardiac pathologies or conditions can lead to a shortened native T1 relaxation time1,3,4,9: Anderson-Fabry disease iron overload hemorrhage fat (e.g. arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia, old chronic infarct) athlete’s heart Applications of myocardial extracellular volume (ECV)Assessment of extracellular volume (ECV) is considered as reasonable in patients getting an extracellular contrast agent1. Diffuse fibrosis can lead to an increase1,4,12of ECV, a moderate to severe increase can be observed in: amyloidosis necrosis scar tissue myocarditis A decrease in extracellular volume (ECV) can be observed in athlete's heart1.Myocardial T2 mappingThe myocardial T2-map depicts the spin-spin (transverse) relaxation of the myocardium and T2, encoded in the voxels of the map, is a time constant for the decay of transverse magnetization.T2 time is related to the water content of the respective tissue, hence the myocardium and thus prolonged T2 reflects myocardial edema, be it due to inflammation or reperfusion20.T2-mapping offers the potential for more objective detection and quantification of myocardial edema than standard black-blood T2 and STIR images, which are often of limited value due to susceptibility or slow flow artifacts20.Myocardial T2 tends to decrease at higher magnetic field strength 17.Applications of T2 MappingT2-mapping can detect edematous myocardial territories in a variety of cardiac pathologies 1,3-5,17-22, including: acute and subacute inflammation/myocarditis  acute ischemia / myocardial infarction  Tako-tsubo cardiomyopathy heart transplant rejection Low T2 values will be seen in iron overload and hemorrhage 1.Myocardial T2* mappingT2*-mapping is usually based on gradient echo (GRE) sequences,  T2* results principally from variations in the static magnetic field throughout the tissue which will be added to random mechanisms. Thus T2* is a time constant for the decay of transverse magnetization, it is only shorter 26. Applications of T2* mappingT2* relaxation time is sensitive to magnetic field inhomogeneity and has become useful in the evaluation of myocardial iron overload and assessment of chelation therapy 3,23-25 and also shows a decrease in myocardial hemorrhage or stress-induced ischemia 1,3.Normal valuesNormal values of native T1 and T2 times differ depending on magnetic field strength (1,5 and 3 T), acquisition sequence (e.g. MOLLI, shMOLLI, SASHA, SAPPHIRE in case of T1-mapping and T2-SSFP, GraSE in case of T2-mapping). Because of variations between scanners, it is still recommended 1,2,10, that local reference ranges are primarily used, and if a local reference range is not available quantitative results should not be clinically reported 1,2.ECV reference ranges from the literature seem to be considered as acceptable, if the same MR system and pulse sequences are used 1.Regarding T2*and iron overload, a 3-tier risk model (low, intermediate and high risk) has been recommended1,25.Clinical useThere is proven clinical utility in a setting of myocarditis, amyloidosis 1,13, Anderson-Fabry disease 1,13 and iron deposition and potential clinical utility regarding many cardiac diseases as cardiomyopathy, heart failure, congenital heart disease, myocardial ischemia and infarction, transplant rejection athlete’s heart and cardiac masses  1,3,13.Detailed recommendations for indications, utility and clinical implementation including imaging protocols, the use of reference ranges and reporting are given in a consensus statement by the Society for Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance (SCMR) 1.Cardiac magnetic resonance fingerprinting (cMRF)To overcome the problem that conventional mapping techniques require separate acquisitions for T1 and T2 mapping, of which values are also dependent on different scanner technology, pulse sequences, and various physiological and environmental parameters, cardiac magnetic resonance fingerprinting (cMRF) technique has been introduced for simultaneous measurement of T1 and T2 maps in a single scan 27,28.See also T1 mapping T2 mapping T2* mapping extracellular volume (ECV) MR fingerprinting (MRF)

__label__Cardiac Myocardial salvage is referred to as the reversibly injured myocardium in a setting of myocardial ischemia and/or myocardial infarction, which remains non-infarcted after reperfusion 1-7. On this page:  Article: Usage Measurement Interpretation See also References   UsageThe assessment of myocardial salvage is an important measure in the evaluation of the efficacy of therapeutic approaches, including coronary reperfusion and cardioprotective measures 1,2 and an adequate myocardial salvage volume is associated with better short- and longterm outcome and survival after myocardial infarction 4.MeasurementMyocardial salvage can be assessed with different methods e.g. with cardiac magnetic resonance 1-6, SPECT and/or a combination of angiographic assessment and biochemical ischemia markers or other imaging modalities 6.  In MRI myocardial salvage can be assessed if either both the myocardial area at risk and the definite size of a myocardial infarct are known 1-7 or can be estimated from the endocardial surface length if late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) is not too small 7.  InterpretationIf the definite infarct size is subtracted from the myocardial area at risk the amount of salvaged myocardium can be obtained 1,2.  MRILate gadolinium enhancement (LGE) can be considered a valid surrogate for infarct size. Different methods to assess myocardial area at risk have been described, the 'myocardial edema based approach' with means of T2/STIR or myocardial mapping to calculate myocardial salvage has been commonly used but discouraged as an endpoint for clinical trials 7.The endocardial surface length can be calculated from late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) and used to estimate myocardial salvage as the viable myocardium within the circumferential extent of the infarct 7.See also myocardial area at risk myocardial infarction

Inflammation from viral etiologies is thought to be caused both by direct cellular damage by the infectious agent and also from involvement by the host's immune system.EtiologyInfectious etiologies viral (most common etiology): e.g. Coxsackievirus, Echovirus, arbovirus bacterial, e.g. Corynebacterium diphtheriae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Borrelia burgdorferi  fungal, e.g. Candida spp. parasites, e.g. Trypanosoma cruzi  Non-infectious etiologies drugs antibiotics antituberculous agents anticonvulsants anti-inflammatories diuretics non-prescription/recreational drugs   radiation transplant rejection giant cell myocarditis systemic disease systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) scleroderma   MarkersAlthough non-specific, cardiac creatine kinase (CK) and troponins I, T and C (TnI, TnT and TnC) are elevated.ClassificationMyocarditis is classified into four categories based on the clinical and pathologic presentation: fulminant, acute, chronic active, and chronic persistent.Radiographic featuresCTNot always useful but some case reports describe certain features that can be helpful such as delayed myocardial enhancement (i.e. similar to MRI) with iodinated contrast 10,11.MRI  cine SSFP regional or global wall motion abnormalities are common but nonspecific (biventricular wall motion abnormality, however, is the main predictor of death or transplantation)  pericardial effusion is reported in ~45% (range 32-57%) of patients with myocarditis    T2 black blood T2 myocardial hyperintensity is compatible with edema T2 hyperintensity may be global and difficult to detect    early gadolinium enhancementregional vasodilatation and increased blood volume due to the inflammation in myocarditis causes early postcontrast enhancement   late gadolinium enhancement  late enhancement in myocarditis is an indication of irreversible myocardial necrosis and fibrosis. distribution of enhancement is variable, but classically involves the subepicardial myocardium (mid-interventricular and focal transmural patterns are also possible)   Lake Louise consensus criteria 2018The original Lake Louise criteria 5 have been updated in 2018.

__label__Head __label__& __label__Neck The myofascial cone is a structure within the orbit involved in the movement and support of the globe, or more simply the eye. It also serves as the physical division between the intraconal and extraconal compartments, but the cone itself is included in the contents of the intraconal space 1. Gross anatomyThe apex of the myofascial cone lies at the posterior aspect of the orbit, the orbital apex, taking origin from the annulus of Zinn from which it extends anteriorly as the four rectus muscles towards its base at the posterior section of the globe, covered in, and connected by the orbital fascia. The organization of myofascial cone allows for the rotational movements of the globe to occur on a fixed axis 1. The space created by this complex arrangement of muscles and intervening connective tissue creates the intraconal space of about 30ml in volume, in contrast to the globe which is only 7ml 2.MusclesThe annulus of Zinn is a fibrocartilagenous structure encircling the optic canal and the medial aspect of the superior orbital fissure. Along its circumference the highly vascular rectus muscles arise; notably, the lateral rectus arises from the largest portion of the annulus, and therefore is the longest muscle and has a more crescentic appearance than the origin of the medial rectus 1.From the common origin of the ring, the rectus muscles continue as an apparently continuous muscular tube for a few millimeters before the muscle bellies can be appreciated separately 3. It is of clinical significance that the rectus muscles insert anteriorly, just beyond the coronal equator of the globe into the sclera; it is at this point the sclera is thinnest and should be inspected in suspected globe rupture.FasciaThe periorbital fascia or periorbita is continuous with the loosely adherent periosteum of the bony orbit, reflects onto the optic nerve sheath and the extraocular muscles upon reaching the apex of the orbit. This fascia invests circumferentially into the perimysium of the extraocular muscles and extends between the lateral margins of the muscles to complete the conical structure of the myofascial cone. Within the confines of this intraconal space lies the orbital fat, which is extensively occupied by fibrous septa that intervene between structures passing through the intraconal space. It is this septal arrangement that is implicated in the clinical findings of upgaze abnormalities resulting from orbital floor fractures 3. It should be noted that veins pass within the septal planes, and arteries pass indiscriminately, piercing the planes to reach their destinations 4.

However, reports of familial occurrence suggest a possible autosomal dominant or recessive inheritance in some cases of infantile myofibromatosis, which have been linked to mutations in the PDGFR-beta and NOTCH3 genes 2.Radiographic featuresFindings are usually nonspecific with a broad differential diagnosis 1.Plain radiograph may not be visible possible dystrophic calcifications may be lytic if intraosseous Ultrasound  greyscale: solid hypoechoic mass, central hypo- to anechoic portion due to necrosis  color Doppler: variable echogenicity CT isodense to muscle osseous erosion, if adjacent to bone possible central necrosis possible dystrophic calcifications MRI ovoid and well-circumscribed may have a target sign due to central necrosis Signal characteristics:  T1: isointense to muscle  T2: hyperintense  T1 C+ (Gd): avid enhancement Treatment and prognosisTreatment includes observation or complete local excision. If resected, recurrence rate reported as 7-10% 3. Generalized myofibromatosis involving the viscera can be treated with chemotherapy 1.History and etymologyMyofibromatosis was initially described by Williams and Schrum in 1951, when it was referred to as "congenital fibrosarcoma" 5. This entity was later renamed  "congenital generalized fibromatosis" by Stout in 1954 6, only to be again renamed "infantile fibromatosis" by Chung and Enzinger 3.In its 2002 classification of soft tissue tumors, the WHO, recognized myofibromatosis under the benign category of fibroblastic-myofibroblastic lesions 4.Differential diagnosisDifferential diagnosis depends on location. For differential diagnoses of a soft tissue location (such as intramuscular):  nerve sheath tumor neurofibroma schwannoma   malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor intramuscular myxoma synovial sarcoma hemangioma metastasis Practical pointsIn practice, a well-circumscribed soft tissue lesion with avid enhancement has a very wide differential. For this reason, biopsy is required to make a definitive diagnosis 1. Given how uncommon myofibromas are compared to nerve sheath tumors and other diagnoses, myofibromas will often be very low on the differential.See also musculoskeletal fibromatoses WHO 2002 classification of soft tissue tumors

__label__Musculoskeletal Myositis ossificans (MO) is a benign process characterized by heterotopic ossification usually within large muscles. Its importance stems in large part from its ability to mimic more aggressive pathological processes. Myositis ossificans is one of the skeletal “don’t touch” lesions.There are some conditions that are related to, or share a similar name to, myositis ossificans 1:  myositis ossificans circumscripta: refers to new bone that usually appears after trauma  myositis ossificans progressiva: a rare, inherited disorder characterized by fibrosing and ossification of muscle, tendon and ligaments of multiple sites that are disabling and ultimately fatal  panniculitis ossificans: similar to MO but occurring in subcutaneous tissues  fibro-osseous pseudotumor of the digits: variant of MO occurring in the fingers and toes  The remainder of this article focuses on the former.

On this page:  Article: Epidemiology Clinical presentation Pathology Radiographic features Treatment and prognosis Differential diagnosis See also References   Images: Cases and figures Imaging differential diagnosis   EpidemiologyMost cases of myositis ossificans occur as a result of trauma, and thus, the primary demographic is young adults 1. Another group which is especially prone to myositis ossificans are paraplegics, usually without evidence of trauma 2.Clinical presentationTypically presents as a painful, tender, enlarging mass, which in 80% of cases is located in large muscles of the extremities, often following recognized local trauma, although a definite traumatic event is not always recalled 1,3. In the case of paraplegics, recognized episodes of trauma are often absent, and the disease occurs particularly around the knees and hips 2.PathologyMyositis ossificans is essentially metaplasia of the intramuscular connective tissue resulting in extraosseous bone formation (without inflammation). It has a zonal organization 1: peripheral, well-organized mature lamellar bone intermediate osteoid region central immature non-ossified cellular (fibroblasts) focus Unfortunately, the histologically of myositis ossificans can appear similar to osteosarcoma, and thus, can lead to inappropriate management.Radiographic featuresThe typical radiographic appearance of myositis ossificans is circumferential calcification with a lucent center and a radiolucent cleft (string sign) that separates the lesion from the cortex of the adjacent bone.Plain radiographCalcification usually begins to become apparent on plain radiographs within 2-6 weeks, and the lesion reaches the classic well-circumscribed peripherally calcified appearance by two months. Over the following 4 or so months, they typically become smaller and denser 1,3.The cleft between it and the subjacent bone may be difficult to see on plain radiographs.CTCT appearances are similar to those of plain radiography, demonstrating mineralization proceeding from the outer margins towards the center. The cleft between it and the subjacent bone is usually visible.The peripheral rim of mineralization is usually visible within 4-6 weeks 3.MRIMRI appearances change with the age of the lesion.Early features can be misleading because the peripheral calcification is not well seen, and edema in the soft tissues may extend beyond the often inapparent calcific rim.  T1ill-defined isointense to muscle mass   T2 periphery: high signal (edema) seen up to 8 weeks 3  central: heterogeneous high signal, due to high proliferating cellularity and cartilaginous components 3  fluid-fluid levels have been reported and attributed to previous hemorrhage 1,3     T1 C+ (Gd): enhancement is often present Late features mimic bone 1,3:  T1 periphery: low signal (mature lamellar bone) central: intermediate to high signal (bone marrow)    T2 periphery: low signal (mature lamellar bone) central: intermediate to high signal (bone marrow)    T1C+(Gd): usually none in mature lesions Nuclear medicineNon-specific increased bone scan uptake on flow and blood pool images is seen early on in the development of the lesion and gradually decreases as the lesion matures 2. Increased uptake on delayed phase is typical.FDG PET can demonstrate intense uptake mimicking high-grade lesions 5.Treatment and prognosisMyositis ossificans is benign and there is no compelling evidence that malignant degeneration ever occurs 1. As such treatment is reserved for symptomatic lesions, and surgical resection is usually curative.Differential diagnosisImaging differential considerations include:  parosteal osteosarcoma: calcifies in the center and continues towards the periphery soft tissue sarcomas including malignant fibrous histiocytoma synovial sarcoma   If fluid-fluid levels are present, then a different differential should be entertained (see differential of fluid-fluid level containing bone lesions).See also soft-tissue calcification dystrophic soft-tissue calcification periarticular calcification calcific myonecrosis

They may account for as many as 12% of chondrosarcomas of bone 2.Clinical presentationExtraskeletal lesions tend to present with a palpable mass 3, 4. PathologyThey are the most common extraskeletal chondrosarcomas, typically occurring in the deep soft tissues of the extremities, with the thigh being most common.Conventional intramedullary chondrosarcomas can often demonstrate some degree of myxoid degeneration, leading to difficulty in accurate diagnosis of this entity 2.Extensive myxoid stroma accounts not only for its name but also its high water content. Histologically as well as on imaging, these tumors are difficult to distinguish from chordomas and accounting for its alternative name of chordoid chondrosarcoma.Radiographic featuresGoing along with its more aggressive clinical course, the lesion is predominantly lytic, with the high water content giving it high signal on T2 weighted images, thus mimicking chordomas on imaging also. Enhancement is usually present but mild. 
__label__Gynaecology Myxoid degeneration of a leiomyoma is one of the rarer types of degeneration that can occur in a standard uterine leiomyoma.

On this page:  Article: Epidemiology Pathology Radiographic features References   Images:Cases and figures  EpidemiologyIt is the second most prevalent type of liposarcoma, representing 30-40% of all liposarcomas in the extremities.PathologyAs with all liposarcomas, it is a malignant tumor of adipose tissue. Myxoid liposarcomas arise from the intermuscular fascial planes or deep-seated areas. They occur most commonly in the lower extremity, particularly the thigh.Other sites (in decreasing order of frequency) include: buttocks retroperitoneum trunk ankle proximal limb girdle head and neck wrist GeneticsShare a characteristic t(12;16)(q13;p11) chromosomal translocation with round cell liposarcomas, resulting in the formation of the TLS/CHOP fusion oncogene.Radiographic featuresMRIA spectrum of MR imaging abnormalities can occur depending on the amount of fat and myxoid material, the degree of cellularity and vascularity, and presence of necrosis. Most tend to have lacy or linear, amorphous foci of fat. Some appear cystic on non-contrast sequences.  T1 can be variable most exhibit high signal-intensity foci within a predominantly homogeneous low signal intensity mass    T2: lacy areas appear more prominent  T1 C+ show enhancement (which can be heterogeneous) enhancing areas within the tumor represent increased cellularity and vascularity while non-enhancing areas represent necrosis, reduced cellularity, and accumulated mucinous material   
__label__Central __label__Nervous __label__System Myxoid meningiomas are rare histological variants of meningiomas grouped into the subtype of metaplastic meningiomas, being WHO grade I tumors.

__label__Oncology __label__Musculoskeletal Myxoid soft tissue tumors are diversified group tumors of mesenchymal origin with a mucoid or myxoid extracellular matrix, which can be benign or malignant 1-3. On this page:  Article: Epidemiology Clinical presentation Pathology Radiographic features Treatment and prognosis History and etymology Differential diagnosis Practical points See also References   Images:Cases and figures  EpidemiologyIncidence depends entirely on the specific tumor with intramuscular myxoma being the most common 2,3 from the benign lesions. Aggressive angiomyxoma is a locally aggressive benign variant affecting mostly women 2,3. Fairly frequent malignant myxoid tumors include myxoid liposarcoma making up 20-50% of all liposarcomas 3, myxofibrosarcoma, formerly known as myxoid malignant fibrous histiocytoma, which is a common malignant soft tissue tumor in the elderly 3.Myxoid chondrosarcomas, ossifying fibromyxoid tumors, low-grade fibromyxoid sarcoma and myxoinflammatory fibroblastic sarcomas are rare variants from the malignant group 2,3 and superficial angiomyxoma, myxolipoma and acral fibromyxoma are rare benign myxoid tumors 2.Clinical presentationDepending on the entity most patients will present with a lump or other painless soft tissue mass somewhere in their extremities or trunk, or they are entirely asymptomatic. Some tumors as extraskeletal myxoid chondrosarcomas or aggressive angiomyxomas can cause pain and tenderness the latter in the perineum 2,3.PathologyMyxoid tumors produce a myxoid extracellular matrix, which is quite heterogeneous among different tumors basically composed of different proteoglycans and glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) 1-4  of which none is specific for a lesion and hyaluronic acid is the most common 4. The myxoid extracellular matrix itself is a histological feature in diverse physiological and pathological conditions 6 and is also found in mesenchymal and epithelial tumors. It is often only a secondary phenomenon in the latter and is more often an intrinsic part of the respective mesenchymal soft tissue tumor 4.Macroscopic, microscopic appearances markers and genetics will depend on each separate entity.LocationMost myxoid soft tissue tumors will be found in the extremities and less often in the trunk 2,3. Intramuscular myxomas will most often occur intramuscularly and in rare occasions intermuscular or subcutaneous; the thigh is the most commonly affected extremity 2,5.Aggressive angiomyxomas are typically found in the perineal area of women in their 20s to 40s 2,3.Myxoid liposarcomas and extraskeletal myxoid chondrosarcomas are typically located within the lower extremities hips, buttocks and the trunk 2,6.Myxoinflammatory fibroblastic sarcoma and acral fibromyxoma typically involve the distal extremities and the subcutaneous tissues 2.ClassificationThe classification of soft tissue tumors was published in the WHO classification 2002, revised 2013 and is mainly founded on clinicopathological and cytogenetic/molecular variations.A simplified classification for myxoid soft tissue tumors was proposed by Baheti at al.  and lists the most important benign and malignant neoplasms 2:Benign myxoid soft tissue tumors intramuscular myxoma aggressive angiomyxoma superficial angiomyxoma myxolipoma acral fibromyxoma dermal myxoma Malignant myxoid soft tissue tumors myxoid liposarcoma myxofibrosarcoma low-grade fibromyxoid sarcoma extraskeletal myxoid chondrosarcoma ossifying fibromyxoid tumor myxoinflammatory fibroblastic sarcoma (MIFS) Radiographic featuresA common feature of all myxoid tumors is their high water content 1-4. Most myxoid tumors will also show a certain heterogeneity. Other features will depend on the respective tumor and will show other features as perilesional fat and/or edema, fatty components, ossifications, calcifications subcutaneous or dermal involvement. Whereas most myxoid soft tissue tumors are well defined, myxofibrosarcomas often have an ill-defined appearance 2.Plain radiographMost myxoid tumors of the soft tissue will not be evident on radiographs unless large, then will be evident as soft tissue swelling.UltrasoundMyxoid lesions will usually be hypoechoic to anechoic in ultrasound 2,3.CTUsually hypodense lesions with densities higher than water 2,3, but definitely less than muscle 2.MRISome tumors are well-defined show perilesional edema or fat 2.Signal characteristics  T1: hypointense to muscle  T2: hyperintense  T1 C+: variable patterns of enhancement exist Treatment and prognosisWill entirely depend on the underlying tumor.Malignant tumors and local aggressive tumors as the intramuscular myxoma and aggressive angiomyxoma will mostly be excised with margins 2,3 and again depending on the respective lesion might require further adjuvant or neoadjuvant chemotherapy or chemoradiation 2,3.For most other benign tumors therapy will depend on symptoms 2.History and etymologyThe term myxosarcoma was introduced by Bryant, which he defined as “mucous transformation of malignant round cell sarcomas usually attacking the omentum and skin” 4.Müller described the myxoid matrix 1838 as collonema, in greek “κολλα” stands for glue and described it further as an “odd gelatinous tumor of soft gelatiniform tissue, which trembles when touched” 4.     The term “myxoma” was then introduced by Rudolph Virchow in Cellularpathologie, 1858. He used it to describe a myxoid soft tissue tumor, which he compared with the jelly-like structure of the umbilical cord 4.Differential diagnosisThe differential diagnosis includes many tumor-like myxoid lesions e.g. ganglion cysts and synovial cysts peripheral nerve sheath tumors including neurofibromas and schwannomas 2,3 and other benign and malignant soft tissue tumors 2.  ganglion cysts  / synovial cysts  peripheral nerve sheath tumors  rhabdomyoma/rhabdomyosarcoma  lymphangioma chronic hematoma  Practical pointsThe finding of a T1 hypointense and T2 hyperintense lesion of the musculoskeletal system, which enhances after contrast and spares the visceral organs, is indicative of a myxoid origin 2.An approach to these tumors is to look at the site of involvement and the patient's age 2.A tumor with a swirling pattern of the perineal region without the involvement of the viscera in a woman in her 3rd or 4th decade might reflect an aggressive angiomyxoma, if the lesion is intramuscular and well defined an intramuscular myxoma is very likely. If a myxoid lesion located in the extremities of a patient in the 6th decade of life and shows an ill-defined appearance a myxofibrosarcoma should be considered. If it is located in the distal extremities with subcutaneous involvement one should think of myxoinflammatory fibroblastic sarcoma (MIFS). The presence of fatty components should suggest a myxoid liposarcoma. Are there ossifications present? – think of ossifying fibromyxoid tumor and noncalcified large lobulated tumors in the proximal lower extremities or limb-girdle regions should rise the thought of extraskeletal myxoid chondrosarcoma 2.See also intramuscular myxoma aggressive angiomyxoma myxoid liposarcoma myxofibrosarcoma low-grade fibromyxoid sarcoma extraskeletal myxoid chondrosarcoma ossifying fibromyxoid tumor myxoinflammatory fibroblastic sarcoma (MIFS)

The lesions are soft and translucent but solid. Large lesions may be clinically malignant even if they do not meet standard criteria for the diagnosis of sarcoma. In these lesions, smooth muscle cells are so widely separated by an abundant myxoid material that mitotic count and cellularity cannot be assessed precisely 1. Radiographic featuresMRISignal characteristics of the myxoid portion include:  T1: geographic and variable signal dependent on protein content 5   T2: high signal intensity   T1 C+ (Gd) enhances well except for small foci of mucinous lakes or clefts delayed and prolonged enhancement is seen due to the presence of a myxoid stroma   Differential diagnosisMRI features can overlap with that of a uterine leiomyosarcoma 5

On this page:  Article: Epidemiology Clinical presentation Pathology Radiographic features Treatment and prognosis Differential diagnosis See also References   Images: Cases and figures Imaging differential diagnosis   EpidemiologyThey tend to have an earlier clinical presentation than other spinal ependymomas, with a mean age of presentation of 35 years. There is a slight male predominance.Clinical presentationThe most common presenting symptoms are low back, leg or sacral pain. Up to 25% of patients may present with leg weakness or sphincter dysfunction.They may occasionally present as a subarachnoid hemorrhage 8.PathologyEtiologyThey are thought to arise from the ependymal glia of the filum terminale. LocationThe vast majority are intradural and extramedullary spinal tumors, occurring in the lumbosacral spine involving the filum terminale and/or conus medullaris. Less commonly, they extend from the lumbar to the thoracic spine 10. Rarely, they can arise in the cervicothoracic spine or fourth ventricle 11.ClassificationThese are WHO grade I ependymal tumors.Macroscopic appearanceThey are typically lobulated, encapsulated, and oval or sausage-shaped. They often have associated hemorrhage and may calcify or undergo cystic degeneration 9.Microscopic appearanceHistologically, they contain papillary elements arranged radially around a hyalinized fibrovascular core, forming perivascular pseudorosettes, with myxoid material between the blood vessel and tumor cells 9. "Balloons" (rounded eosinophilic PAS positive structures) are sometimes encountered 9.  ImmunophenotypeAs is the case with ependymomas generally, myxopapillary ependymomas are GFAP, S100, and vimentin positive 9. CD99, AE1/AE3 and NCAM1 are also commonly positive 9. Radiographic featuresPlain radiograph / CTIf they become large, myxopapillary ependymomas may expand the spinal canal, cause scalloping of the vertebral bodies and extend out of the neural exit foramina.MRIThey are well-defined intradural tumors. Classically, they present when larger and sausage-shaped, spanning more than one vertebral level, but small oval tumors are also seen. Smaller tumors tend to displace the nerve roots of the cauda equina; larger tumors often compress or encase them 8.Signal characteristics  T1 usually isointense prominent mucinous component occasionally results in T1 hyperintensity hemorrhage and calcification can also lead to regions of hyper- or hypointensity    T2 overall high intensity low intensity may be seen at the tumor margins because of hemorrhage, called the cap sign (myxopapillary ependymomas are the subtype of ependymomas that are most prone to hemorrhage 8) calcification may also lead to regions of low T2 signal    T1 C+ (Gd) enhancement is virtually always seen the enhancement pattern is typically homogeneous. However, they can have a variable enhancement pattern that, in part, depends on the amount of hemorrhage present   Treatment and prognosisMyxopapillary ependymomas are generally slow-growing and benign. Occasionally, CSF dissemination occurs and multiple lesions are seen in 14-43% cases 4. Some sacral lesions are locally aggressive and metastasize to lymph nodes, lung, and bone. Aggressive behavior is more commonly seen in children 9.  They can often be excised completely. In these cases, the prognosis is excellent, with 5-year-survival over 98% 9.If the tumor has extended to the conus medullaris, resection is often incomplete, with greater risk of local recurrence, and there is a greater risk of neurologic deficit 11.Differential diagnosisDifferential diagnosis of a small conus and filum terminale myxopapillary ependymoma includes: schwannoma paraganglioma Differential diagnosis of a large myxopapillary ependymoma that causes sacral destruction:  aneurysmal bone cyst: involving the spine chordoma  giant cell tumor: involving the spine See alsointradural spinal mass lesions-an approach

They are thought to form as a result of the healing process of chronic cervicitis and represent mucinous cysts due to obstruction from an overgrowth of squamous epithelium. Symptomatic nabothian cysts can also occur as a late complication of subtotal hysterectomy, in which internalisation of the transformation zone and partial obliteration of the canal are postulated as predisposing factors.SizeNabothian cysts are usually small spanning a few millimeters in diameter but on occasion, have been reported reach extreme sizes of up to 4 cm.VariantsTunnel cluster: a special type of nabothian cyst, is characterized by complex multicystic dilatation of the endocervical glands.Radiographic featuresUltrasoundTypically seen an anechoic well defined cystic lesions near the endocervical canal. If the cysts are large, the cervical region can appear enlarged 11. Color Doppler interrogation shows no associated color flow.CTIf small may not be detectable on CT. May occasionally be seen as a focal low attenuation region within the cervical region.MRIThey may be seen as well-circumscribed single or multiple cystic lesions within the cervical stroma.Signal characteristics typically follow that of fluid 2.  T1   iso- to hypointense relative to muscle in typical cases very rare cases with mucin may show some high signal    T2: cysts are hyperintense relative to muscle  T1 C+ (Gd): there is no associated enhancement and typically have no solid enhancing components Treatment and prognosisMost nabothian cysts are clinically insignificant. The majority of cases are not treated because the cysts are entirely benign; however, an excision biopsy is sometimes indicated in large, complex, cystic lesions to rule out rare forms of mucus-producing neoplasia, including adenoma malignum 12. History and etymologyNabothian cysts were first described by Guillaume Desnoues (1650–1735), a French surgeon in 1681, who thought that they represented a store of spermatic-related substances. The German physician, Martin Naboth (1675–1721) published a monograph on female sterility in 1707 and felt that the cysts were a collection of the woman's ova 13.  Differential diagnosisGeneral imaging differential considerations include: cystic cervicitis  adenoma malignum: minimal deviation adenocarcinoma (MDA) of the cervix 4  
__label__Paediatrics __label__Central __label__Nervous __label__System N-acetylaspartate (NAA) is one of the more important compounds assessed on MR spectroscopy, and resonates at 2.0 ppm chemical shift (its concentration in healthy adults is 8-10 mM) 1. The synthesis of NAA, adenosine diphosphate-dependent, occurs in the neuronal mitochondria 2.NAA is the acetylated form of the amino acid, aspartate, which is found in high concentrations in neurons and is a marker of neuronal viability. It is therefore reduced in any process that destroys neurons, such as high grade tumors, radionecrosis, non-neuronal tumors (e.g. cerebral metastases and primary CNS lymphoma). Markedly elevated NAA peak and NAA: creatinine ratio are pathognomonic for Canavan disease 7. The NAA peak level may decrease after gene therapy.Many studies have shown the reduction of NAA, in specific brain areas, in schizophrenic patients: hippocampus, mesial regions of the temporal lobes and frontal lobes 3-6.

__label__Chest The Naclerio V sign is a sign described on the plain film in patients with a pneumomediastinum occurring often secondary to an esophageal rupture. It is seen as a V-shaped air collection. One limb of the V is produced by mediastinal gas outlining the left lower lateral mediastinal border. The other limb is produced by gas between the parietal pleura and medial left hemidiaphragm. Although Naclerio V sign was originally described in patients with esophagealrupture, it is not entirely specific to that condition.  History and etymologyIt is named after Emil A Naclerio (1915-1985), an American thoracic surgeon, who first described it in 1957 1,4.

__label__Musculoskeletal __label__Spine The naked facet sign (also known as the hamburger sign or reverse hamburger bun sign) refers to the CT appearance of an uncovered vertebral articular facet when the facet joint is dislocated, most often in cases of locked facet. This CT sign is characteristic of a flexion-distraction injury and indicates severe ligamentous disruption and spinal instability.Normally, at axial CT, the vertebral facet (apophyseal) joint space looks like a hamburger: the superior articular process of the vertebra below forms the semicircular “bun” on top of the “meat patty,” and the inferior articular process of the vertebra above forms the bun beneath the patty. When the facet joint is dislocated, the articular facets become uncovered, or naked. The top bun of the hamburger (the superior articular facet) now lies posteriorly. This is the hamburger sign/reverse hamburger bun sign, which may be either unilateral or bilateral depending on whether facet dislocation is unilateral or bilateral.

__label__Gastrointestinal __label__Cardiac The napkin ring sign may refer to either of the following imaging findings:  napkin ring sign (colon): colonic stenosis such as due to colon cancer  napkin ring sign (coronary): coronary artery vulnerable plaque A napkin ring is a decorative household item used in some Western societies to hold cloth napkins in a roll at its center. The imaging metaphor applies to circumferential stenotic lesions.
__label__Cardiac The napkin-ring sign is a feature of high-risk coronary artery atherosclerotic plaque on CT coronary angiogram (coronary CTA). It has been shown to possess a high predictive value in predicting future cardiac events and is considered one of the imaging correlates of an unstable plaque. It is not to be confused with the napkin ring sign of the bowel (apple core sign). Radiographic featuresThe sign refers to a rupture-prone plaque in a coronary artery, comprising a necrotic core covered by a thin cap (cap thickness <65 μm), also referred to as so-called thin-cap fibroatheroma.While the cap itself is too thin to be depicted by non-invasive imaging techniques including CT, the necrotic core may be visible on thin sections (<0.6 mm) of modern coronary CTA.The napkin-ring sign represents a cross-section of a coronary artery showing luminal narrowing by a low attenuating eccentric structure (also called circumferentially extensive necrotic core), that is surrounded by a thin ring-like hyperattenuating rim and may represent indirect evidence of the aforementioned thin, vulnerable cap 1-5.Treatment and prognosisThe napkin-ring sign has recently been shown to be associated with future cardiac events presenting as culprit lesion in acute coronary syndrome 1.

__label__Head __label__& __label__Neck __label__Musculoskeletal __label__Trauma Nasal bone fractures are the most common type of facial fractures, accounting for ~45% of facial fractures, and are often missed when significant facial swelling is present.  On this page:  Article: Clinical presentation Pathology Radiographic features Treatment and prognosis Differential diagnosis Related articles References   Images: Cases and figures Imaging differential diagnosis   Clinical presentationUnsurprisingly, nasal bone fractures occur when the nose impacts against a solid object (e.g. fist, forehead, dashboard, etc.). Lateral impact injuries are the most common type of nasal injury leading to fracture.PathologyNasal bone fractures, when isolated, are most commonly a displaced fracture of one of the paired nasal bones. There is often associated with other facial fractures and this requires careful assessment 3,5: nasal septum orbital blow-out fracture frontal process of the maxilla  Nasal septal hematoma should also be actively assessed. Radiographic featuresIt should be noted that cartilaginous injuries cannot be detected radiologically and that imaging of simple nasal bone fractures often adds little to patient management. However, imaging can be useful in the documentation, assessing the extent and associated facial fractures and/or complications 5.Plain radiograph sensitivity ~80% 6  best detected on the lateral view  Waters view is useful in assessing the nasal arch 4  CTsensitivity is 100% 6 Treatment and prognosisTreatment depends on the degree of displacement. If the alignment is essentially anatomical then no treatment is required. If the displacement is significant then if untreated they may result both in an unfavorable cosmetic result and in impaired function (i.e. difficulty in breathing through one or both nasal passages). Untreated nasal fractures account for a high percentage of rhinoplasty and septoplasty procedures. The worst morbidity results from septal hematoma, leading to nasal septal perforation and necrosis, which causes severe nasal collapse and deformation.Differential diagnosislongitudinally-oriented fractures may be confused for the nasomaxillary suture and/or nasociliary groove

It should be noted that the posterior ethmoid veins anastomose with veins of the dura mater and orbit, making this a potential route of spread of infection. There is also an anastomosis with veins of the external nose 6.InnervationThe olfactory nerve (CN I) supplies the special sensation of smell to the olfactory epithelium in the roof of the nasal cavity, with fibers passing upwards through the cribriform plate to the olfactory bulb.Mucosal somatic sensation of the nasal cavity is derived from numerous nerves, but in general terms the branches of the ophthalmic division of the trigeminal nerve (CN Va) supply the anterosuperior half whereas branches of the maxillary division of the trigeminal nerve (CN Vb) supply the posteroinferior half.

__label__Head __label__& __label__Neck The nasal conchae or turbinates are long, narrow curled shelves of bone that protrude into the nasal cavity. The superior, middle and inferior conchae divide the nasal cavity into four groove-like air passages. Their position and relationship to other important anatomic landmarks are extremely important especially in skull base and ENT surgical procedures.Gross anatomyEach inferior nasal concha is a separate facial bone articulating with its respective maxilla and palatine bone. Conversely, both the middle and superior conchae are part of the ethmoid bone 2. The conchae are located laterally in the nasal cavity and covered by pseudostratified columnar, ciliated respiratory epithelium with a thick, vascular and erectile glandular tissue layer. Each pair is composed of one concha that curls medially and downwards on either side of the nasal cavity, separated by the septum 1:  inferior conchae: these are the largest conchae and may be as long as the index finger; they are responsible for the majority of airflow direction, humidification, heating and filtering of air inhaled through the nose  middle conchae: small and usually as long as the 5th finger; they project downwards over the openings of the maxillary and ethmoid sinuses and act as buffers to protect the sinuses from pressurised nasal airflow  superior conchae: the smallest of the conchae, connected to the middle conchae by nerve-endings and serves to protect the olfactory bulb    supreme conchae: variably present, it is usually very small and is the highest of all conchae

It presents as an external swelling on the nose. The swelling is usually soft, with normal overlying skin, and increases in size on coughing/straining. Symptomatic patients usually present with obstruction or rhinorrhea.Nasal encephaloceles are typically identified in association with a discernible cranial bone defect.PathologyNasal encephaloceles are anterior encephaloceles where meningeal herniation occurs through a midline defect in the floor of the anterior cranial fossa.Radiographic featuresCTCT is good for delineating bony abnormalities but not for detecting an intracranial component.MRIMRI is better for delineating soft tissue details, including any intracranial connection. It also minimizes the level of exposure to ionizing radiationTreatment and prognosisWhen a midline nasal swelling is present, no invasive procedures nor operations are performed until an intracranial connection has been excluded using CT scanning or MRI, due to the risk of meningitis or cerebrospinal fluid leakage.Differential diagnosisGeneral imaging differential considerations include other midline nasal region lesions: nasal glioma nasal dermoid hemangioma  lipoma    
__label__Head __label__& __label__Neck __label__Paediatrics Nasal gliomas, also know as nasal glial heterotopia, are a rare congenital lesion composed of dysplastic glial cells which have lost their intracranial connections and present as an extranasal or intranasal mass.  On this page:  Article: Epidemiology Clinical presentation Pathology Radiographic features Treatment and prognosis Differential diagnosis Related articles References   Images: Cases and figures Imaging differential diagnosis   EpidemiologyNasal gliomas are rare congenital lesions. These masses occur sporadically with no familial tendency or gender predilection 2.Clinical presentationExtranasal gliomas clinically present in early infancy or childhood as a firm, red to bluish skin-covered mass. These masses will not exhibit pulsations or increase in size with the Valsalva maneuver or compression of the ipsilateral jugular vein (Furstenberg sign).They are typically slow growing; however, they may grow more or less rapidly than the adjacent soft tissue.Intranasal gliomas present as large, firm, submucosal masses that extend inferiorly, toward or near the nostril. They can cause: obstruction of the nasal passage respiratory compromise in infants obstruction of the nasolacrimal duct, with resultant epiphora  cerebrospinal rhinorrhea  meningitis   epistaxis  PathologyNasal gliomas are composed of dysplastic glial tissue and are congenital non-neoplastic lesions best categorized as heterotopia. They are rarely associated with other congenital malformations 2. A nasal glioma may be connected to the brain by a stalk of tissue in up to 15% of cases, but the stalk does not contain a direct fluid-filled tract that communicates with the subarachnoid spaces; therefore, a nasal glioma is distinct from a nasal encephalocele.LocationThey can be subdivided into: extranasal: 60% intranasal: 30%  mixed forms: 10% Nasal gliomas occur near the root of the nose (where the cranial portion of the nose joins the forehead). Extra-nasal gliomas are usually seen in a paramedian location at the bridge of the nose external to the nasal passage, whereas intranasal lesions are usually located within the nasal passage medial to the middle turbinate bone. Radiographic featuresUltrasoundUltrasound is useful for determining if the mass is cystic or solid. Doppler flow studies of nasal gliomas reveal a characteristic low arterial flow velocity during the end-diastolic phase 3.MRINasal gliomas are often isointense relative to the normal brain at MR imaging, which is the imaging modality of choice. High-resolution surface coil MR imaging is often useful in demonstrating the intracranial stalk.Treatment and prognosisOnce the diagnosis of a nasal glioma is established, early surgical resection is advocated to prevent local recurrence, nasal deformity, and secondary visual involvement 3.

__label__Head __label__& __label__Neck Nasal septal perforation may affect either the bony, or cartilaginous septum. Most commonly it affects the anterior septal cartilaginous area although with syphilis it characteristically affects the bony septum. On this page:  Article: Clinical presentation Pathology Treatment and prognosis See also References   Images:Cases and figures  Clinical presentationSymptoms include a nasal discharge, nasal congestion (loss of laminar airflow associated with a septal perforation causes symptoms of nasal congestion), nasal whistling sound (heard in persons with small anterior septal perforations), epistaxis and nasal crust.The diagnosis of septal perforation is often established based on the results of a routine physical examination, The physical examination, in some select circumstances, may help establish the cause of the septal perforation and often influences the choice of treatment.PathologyEtiologyUnfortunately, the majority of nasal septal perforations are iatrogenic in origin and usually occur as a complication of septal surgery, particularly when the Killian submucous resection technique is used. Although the septoplasty procedure does not give complete immunity against this complication, perforations are rare following this operation.Causes of septal perforation can be summarized under the following categories: trauma surgical repeated cautery digital trauma (nose picking)   malignant disease malignant tumors non-Hodgkin lymphoma 5   malignant granuloma   chronic inflammatory conditions  granulomatosis with polyangiitis 5  syphilis tuberculosis sarcoidosis   poisons industrial chronic (> 3 months) cocaine use 4  topical corticosteroids topical decongestants   idiopathic Alternatively a not-very-useful mnemonic can be employed. Treatment and prognosisInformation on the size and position of the perforation is important when planning treatment. Small perforations are often repaired with different approaches and techniques than larger perforations. Small anterior perforations are more likely to cause whistling. Larger, anterior perforations are more likely to crust and to create nasal congestive symptoms. Posterior perforations are less likely to cause symptoms; therefore, patients with these perforations may only need a focused search for an etiology and conservative observational treatment.MedicalIn general, medical therapy is directed at minimizing symptoms associated with nasal septal perforations, such as epistaxis, crusting, and nasal congestion, and treating causative medical conditions, including lupus and sarcoidosis.ObturatorsNasal silastic buttons are available for insertion. Some patients tolerate the buttons for many years; however, many patients do not. Some companies offer silastic buttons that can be custom fitted to the patient.SurgicalAims at closing the perforation with different types of flaps and grafts.See alsoradiological manifestation of recreational drug use
__label__Head __label__& __label__Neck The nasal septum (Latin: septum nasi) separates the left and right nasal cavities. It extends from the nares anteriorly to the choanae posteriorly and is covered by squamous epithelium.StructureThe vertical midline nasal septum is comprised primarily of a single nasal cartilage from the external nose and two bones. Anteriorly the septal cartilage (or quadrangular cartilage) which approximates a quadrilateral shape. Posteriorly it meets the concave anterior margins of the ethmoid and vomer. Superoposteriorly is the perpendicular plate of the ethmoid, inferoposteriorly is the vomer; these two bones have a diagonal articulation running in a superoposteriorly-anteroinferiorly direction. Occasionally the nasal septal cartilage extends more posteriorly interposing itself between the ethmoid and vomer which in some cases never meet 1.The anterior septum, at the border between bone portion and cartilage, presents to consider the septal tubercle (or organ of Zuckerkandl), consisting of a rudimental area of erectile tissue 4.In addition, the nasal crest of the palatine bone which articulates anteriorly with the nasal crest of the maxilla, together form a horizontal strip of bone, which articulates above with the inferior margin of the vomer.The greater alar cartilages which form part of the cartilaginous scaffolding of the external nose each have two crura, lateral and medial. The two medial crura are tenuously joined in the midline and together with some intervening soft tissue form the septum mobile nasi at the most anteroinferior margin of the septal cartilage. Anteriorly, the columella is the visible soft tissue portion of the nasal septum that separates the two nares (nostrils) and incorporates the septum mobile nasi.Vascular supplyArterial supply is via the:  sphenopalatine artery: a branch of the maxillary artery   anterior and posterior ethmoidal arteries: branches of the ophthalmic artery   superior labial artery (anteriorly): a branch of the facial artery  greater palatine artery (posteriorly): a branch of the maxillary artery  Innervation  anterior ethmoidal nerve: posterosuperior septum nasal branches of the greater palatine nerve: posteroinferior septum  nasopalatine nerve, a branch of the maxillary nerve (CN V2): anterior (cartilaginous) septum  On this page:  Article: Variant anatomy Development Related pathology Related articles References   Variant anatomyNasal septal deviation is extremely common.DevelopmentAround the fourth week of gestation, neural crest cells begin to migrate caudally toward the midface.

On this page:  Article: Epidemiology Clinical presentation Pathology Radiographic features Treatment and prognosis Differential diagnosis See also References   Images:Cases and figures  EpidemiologyNasolabial cyst occurs 3 times as commonly in women as men. Most patients present in the fourth decade of life.Clinical presentationThe patient usually presents with a slowly enlarging asymptomatic swelling. Patients usually seek medical advice on secondary infection of the cyst or due to the resulting disfigurement.On palpation, there is a non-tender, fluctuant, mobile swelling in the alar region. The soft-tissue swelling may obliterate the nasolabial fold, elevate the ala or the floor of the nose (or both) and fill in the labial vestibule intraorally, with or without nasal obstruction. The lesion may spontaneously rupture and drain orally, nasally or, occasionally via a cutaneous fistula.PathologyThe cyst is derived from epithelial cells retained in the mesenchyme after fusion of the medial and lateral nasal processes and the maxillary prominence during fetal life or due to the persistence of epithelial remnants from the nasolacrimal duct extending between the lateral nasal process and the maxillary prominence.Radiographic featuresThe radiographic findings of a cyst in the nasolabial region that is separated from bony structures and teeth is suggestive of a nasolabial cyst.CTCT shows a well-demarcated, rounded, homogeneous, low-density soft tissue lesion at the nasolabial region. Evidence of scalloping and bone remodeling may be seen.MRIMRI shows the characteristics of fluid in T1 (hypointense) and T2 (hyperintense) sequences.Treatment and prognosisTreatment is surgical excision through sublabial incision. There is no tendency for recurrence if it was removed completely. Malignant transformation is rare.Differential diagnosisThe differential diagnosis should include odontogenic, developmental and neoplastic lesions.   odontogenic cyst: periapical inflammatory lesion (granuloma, cyst or abscess) that have thinning out the bone; careful examination of the adjacent teeth and testing its vitality can help to rule out this possibility; OPG will show evidence of non-vital tooth with radiolucency  dentigerous cyst: the usual radiographic appearance of dentigerous cyst is that of a well-demarcated radiolucent lesion attached at an acute angle to the cervical area of an unerupted tooth  epidermal inclusion cyst: has similar radiographic appearance but pathologically, unlike the normal pink or bluish coloration of a nasolabial cyst, this cyst is a yellow hue in color See alsonasopalatine duct cyst

__label__Head __label__& __label__Neck The nasolacrimal duct (NLD) is the terminal part of the nasolacrimal apparatus.Gross anatomyThe nasolacrimal duct is the inferior continuation of the lacrimal sac and is ~17 mm in length in total. There are two parts to the nasolacrimal duct:  intraosseous part (12 mm): enters the lacrimal groove and descends within the nasolacrimal canal of the maxilla   membranous part (5 mm): runs in the nasal mucosa; terminates below the inferior nasal meatus as a slit-like opening where it is covered by a mucosal fold called the valve of Hasner (or plica lacrimalis) ValvesUp to eight 'valves' of the nasolacrimal duct have been defined in the literature and are commonly seen in older anatomical texts and monographs. However, it has been contended that some of these are not true mucosal valves but just embryological irregularities in the ductal wall. From craniad to caudad, these 'valves' have been named: Foltz, Bochdalek, Rosenmüller, Huschke, Aubaret, Krause (or Béraud), Taillefer, Hasner (or Cruveilhier/Bianchi) 3,4Therefore a recent retrospective study used digital subtraction dacryocystography (a high spatial resolution technique) to precisely define the intraluminal anatomy of the nasolacrimal duct and determine which of these named structures really represent consistent anatomical features. The researchers used a study group of 92 individuals for whom DS-DCG had previously been reported as normal 3,4:The inferior group of 'valves' were consistently better seen: valve of Krause: was visible in 79.3% cases  valve of Taillefer: 93.5% cases valve of Hasner (plica lacrimalis): 98.9% cases The superior group of 'valves' were inconsistently visualized and were therefore thought to be mucosal irregularities rather than true anatomical valves: valve of Foltz and valve of Bochdalek: were visible in 17.1% cases valve of Rosenmüller and valve of Huschke: 46.4% cases valve of Aubaret: 40% cases

When larger, these tumors are difficult to distinguish these from cutaneous or sinonasal tumors with direct extension into the region.CTWhen evident on imaging, most masses appear as soft tissue lesions involving the medial canthus region.

The vast majority of applicable tumors are nasopharyngeal carcinomas, but other epithelial malignancies of the nasopharynx are included, such as minor salivary gland tumors. The following article reflects the 8th edition published by the American Joint Committee on Cancer, which is used for staging starting January 1, 2018 1,2.

__label__Head __label__& __label__Neck __label__Oncology Nasopharyngeal carcinomas (NPC) are the most common primary malignancy of the nasopharynx. It is of squamous cell origin, some types of which are strongly associated with the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). On this page:  Article: Epidemiology Clinical presentation Pathology Radiographic features Treatment and prognosis Differential diagnosis References   Images: Cases and figures Imaging differential diagnosis   EpidemiologyNasopharyngeal carcinoma accounts for ~70% of all primary malignancies of the nasopharynx, and although rare in western populations, it is one of the most common malignancies encountered in Asia, especially China 1,3-5. It is commonly diagnosed between 40 and 60 years. Males are more commonly affected, with a male to female ratio of 3:1.Clinical presentationClinical presentation is often late, only when the tumor has grown significantly in size and has invaded adjacent structures. Hence, metastasis is very common at the time of presentation. Clinical presentation includes epistaxis and conductive hearing loss.Early, but often ignored, symptoms include nasal obstruction, epistaxis, or conductive hearing loss due to Eustachian tube obstruction and the development of a middle ear effusion. Actual presentation is often delayed until more sinister signs are evident, including nodal masses in the neck (most common), cranial nerve palsies, tinnitus, headache, or even diplopia and proptosis 1,2.Diagnosis is usually achieved with endoscopic guided biopsy 4. A minority of patients have the submucosal disease, with normal appearing overlying mucosa. MRI is then essential in guiding biopsy 4.PathologyThese tumors are defined as carcinomas that arise from the nasopharyngeal mucosa and show squamous differentiation 8. Earlier WHO classifications (1978 and 1991) divided NPC into three subtypes, but the most recent (2005) divides NPC by histological features and is less focused on naming Types 1-3 1,2,8: keratinizing squamous cell carcinoma non-keratinizing carcinoma differentiated type undifferentiated type   basaloid squamous cell carcinoma Risk factorsRisk factors are different depending on the histologic type of tumor present.Keratinizing squamous cell carcinoma can be thought of as a run-of-the-mill head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, which happens to be located in the nasopharynx. Its biological behavior is similar and it shares the same risk factors, namely smoking and alcohol 2. The other important risk factor is ingested nitrosamines (Chinese diet). Non-keratinizing squamous cell carcinoma and basaloid squamous cell carcinoma are strongly associated with the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), and are seen particularly in Asia 1-4. Additional risk factors include consumption of salted fish and meat, and rancid butter 2.All three types express cytokeratin, and types II and III have incorporation of the EBV into their genome and circulating IgA antibodies to EBV in peripheral blood 1-4.Recently, HPV infection showed an etiologic role in the development of non-endemic EBV-negative nasopharyngeal cancers. HPV-positive and EBV/HPV-negative tumors exhibited worse outcomes than EBV-positive tumors 7.StagingSee nasopharyngeal carcinoma staging.Radiographic featuresImaging is crucial in delineating the extent of local tumor extension, as well as detecting nodal metastases which are present in the vast majority of patients at the time of diagnosis (75-90%) 1,3. Unfortunately, imaging in isolation is not only unable to distinguish between the various types of NPC, but also unable to distinguish NPCs from other primary malignancies of the nasopharynx 1. Initially, they efface the fossa of Rosenmüller. Level II and V, and retropharyngeal nodes are commonly involved.CTCT is not only more readily available but is also the ideal modality to assess early bony involvement. Nasopharyngeal carcinomas appear as soft tissue masses most commonly centered at the fossa of Rosenmüller.Small lesions are confined to the nasopharynx by the pharyngobasilar fascia, and are indistinguishable from the prominent adenoidal tissue.Larger/more aggressive tumors may extend in any direction, eroding the base of the skull and passing via the Eustachian tube, foramen lacerum, foramen ovale, or directly through the bone into the clivus, cavernous sinus and temporal bone. In such cases, the bone has irregular margins where it has been destroyed, characteristic of aggressive processes.Following administration of contrast, the tumor mass and nodal metastases usually demonstrate heterogeneous enhancement.Careful assessment of cervical lymph nodes is essential due to the high rate of nodal involvement at the time of diagnosis. The retropharyngeal nodes are usually the first affected. However, in up to 35% of cases, these nodes are skipped, and level II nodes are involved first 1,3.NB: Post-radiotherapy fibrosis can mimic residual tumor on CT 3.MRIMRI is more sensitive to perineural spread and for demonstrating early the bone marrow changes of infiltration (see normal bone marrow signal of the clivus), although not all bone marrow changes represent tumor extension 3. Similarly, dural thickening may be evidence of either tumor infiltration or reactive hyperplasia 3.Signal characteristics  T1: typically isointense to muscle  T2 isointense to somewhat hyperintense to muscle fat saturation is helpful 5  fluid in the middle ear is a helpful marker    T1 C+ (Gd) post-contrast sequences should be fat-saturated prominent heterogeneous enhancement is typical perineural extension should be sought   Post-radiotherapy fibrosis can be distinguished from a recurrent or a residual tumor on MR if the fibrosis is mature. In such cases, fibrotic scarring is of low signal intensity on T2 and does not demonstrate enhancement. Early fibrotic change cannot be distinguished from a residual/recurrent tumor, as both may be hyperintense on T2 and demonstrate enhancement 3.Nuclear medicineF-18 FDG-PET is highly sensitive for nodal metastases and is the modality of choice to detect recurrence.Treatment and prognosisThe mainstay of treatment is external beam radiotherapy, supplemented in some cases with chemotherapy. Surgery has little role in the management of nasopharyngeal carcinoma other than for the purposes of diagnostic biopsy. Surgery is also considered in radiation-resistant tumors and in local recurrence.ComplicationsA potential complication of radiotherapy is radiation necrosis of the temporal lobes, as well as cranial nerve dysfunction, and atrophy and fibrosis of the muscles of mastication and salivary glands 3.Differential diagnosisOn imaging alone, nasopharyngeal carcinomas appear similar to other primary nasopharyngeal malignancies. Tumors of the skull base should also be included in the differential, especially when significant bony involvement is present.The differential for a small mass confined to the mucosal space includes: prominent but normal adenoidal tissueoften has a striped appearance at MRI on T1WI and T2WI 4   nasopharyngeal lymphoma low grade or other early primary nasopharyngeal malignancies  The differential for a larger mass with involvement of base of skull includes all of the above, with the addition of the following: metastases to nasopharyngeal region adenoid cystic carcinoma plasmacytoma fibrosing pseudotumor lymphoma chordoma chondrosarcoma meningioma juvenile nasopharyngeal angiofibroma (JNA) even pituitary macroadenoma

LOC questionsThe patient is asked the month and his/her age. The answer must be correct - there is no partial credit for being close. Aphasic and stuporous patients who do not comprehend the questions will score 2. Patients unable to speak because of endotracheal intubation, orotracheal trauma, severe dysarthria from any cause, language barrier, or any other problem not secondary to aphasia are given a 1. It is important that only the initial answer be graded and that the examiner not "help" the patient with verbal or non-verbal cues.  0 = answers both questions correctly 1 = answers one question correctly 2 = answers neither question correctly 1c. LOC commandsThe patient is asked to open and close the eyes and then to grip and release the non-paretic hand. Substitute another one step command if the hands cannot be used. Credit is given if an unequivocal attempt is made but not completed due to weakness. If the patient does not respond to command, the task should be demonstrated to him or her (pantomime), and the result scored (i.e., follows none, one or two commands). Patients with trauma, amputation, or other physical impediments should be given suitable one-step commands. Only the first attempt is scored.  0 = performs both tasks correctly 1 = performs one task correctly 2 = performs neither task correctly 2. Best gazeOnly horizontal eye movements will be tested. Voluntary or reflexive (oculocephalic) eye movements will be scored, but caloric testing is not done. If the patient has a conjugate deviation of the eyes that can be overcome by voluntary or reflexive activity, the score will be 1. If a patient has an isolated peripheral nerve paresis (CN III, IV or VI), score a 1. Gaze is testable in all aphasic patients. Patients with ocular trauma, bandages, pre-existing blindness, or other disorder of visual acuity or fields should be tested with reflexive movements, and a choice made by the investigator. Establishing eye contact and then moving about the patient from side to side will occasionally clarify the presence of a partial gaze palsy.  0 = normal 1 = partial gaze palsy; gaze is abnormal in one or both eyes, but forced deviation or total gaze paresis is not present 2 = forced deviation, or total gaze paresis not overcome by the oculocephalic maneuver 3. Visual fieldsVisual fields (upper and lower quadrants) are tested by confrontation, using finger counting or visual threat, as appropriate. Patients may be encouraged, but if they look at the side of the moving fingers appropriately, this can be scored as normal. If there is unilateral blindness or enucleation, visual fields in the remaining eye are scored. Score 1 only if a clear-cut asymmetry, including quadrantanopia, is found. If patient is blind from any cause, score 3. Double simultaneous stimulation is performed at this point. If there is extinction, patient receives a 1, and the results are used to respond to item 11.  0 = no visual loss 1 = partial hemianopia 2 = complete hemianopia 3 = bilateral hemianopia (blind including cortical blindness) 4. Facial palsyAsk – or use pantomime to encourage – the patient to show teeth or raise eyebrows and close eyes. Score symmetry of grimace in response to noxious stimuli in the poorly responsive or non-comprehending patient. If facial trauma/bandages, orotracheal tube, tape or other physical barriers obscure the face, these should be removed to the extent possible.  0 = normal symmetrical movements 1 = minor paralysis (flattened nasolabial fold, asymmetry on smiling) 2 = partial paralysis (total or near-total paralysis of lower face) 3 = complete paralysis of one or both sides (absence of facial movement in the upper and lower face) 5. Motor: armThe limb is placed in the appropriate position: extend the arms (palms down) 90 degrees (if sitting) or 45 degrees (if supine). Drift is scored if the arm falls before 10 seconds. The aphasic patient is encouraged using urgency in the voice and pantomime, but not noxious stimulation. Each limb is tested in turn, beginning with the non-paretic arm. Only in the case of amputation or joint fusion at the shoulder, the examiner should record the score as untestable (UN), and clearly write the explanation for this choice.  0 = no drift; limb holds 90 (or 45) degrees for full 10 seconds 1 = drift; limb holds 90 (or 45) degrees, but drifts down before full 10 seconds; does not hit bed or other support 2 = some effort against gravity; limb cannot get to or maintain (if cued) 90 (or 45) degrees, drifts down to bed, but has some effort against gravity 3 = no effort against gravity; limb falls 4 = no movement UN = amputation or joint fusion, explain: _____________________  5a. left arm 5b. right arm 6. Motor: legThe limb is placed in the appropriate position: hold the leg at 30 degrees (always tested supine). Drift is scored if the leg falls before 5 seconds. The aphasic patient is encouraged using urgency in the voice and pantomime, but not noxious stimulation. Each limb is tested in turn, beginning with the non-paretic leg. Onlyin the case of amputation or joint fusion at the hip, the examiner should record the score as untestable (UN), and clearly write the explanation for this choice.  0 = no drift; leg holds 30-degree position for full 5 seconds 1 = drift; leg falls by the end of the 5-second period but does not hit bed 2 = some effort against gravity; leg falls to bed by 5 seconds, but has some effort against gravity 3 = no effort against gravity;leg falls to bed immediately. 4 = no movement UN = amputation or joint fusion, explain: ________________  6a. left Leg 6b. right Leg 7. Limb ataxiaThis item is aimed at finding evidence of a unilateral cerebellar lesion. Test with eyes open. In case of visual defect, ensure testing is done in intact visual field. The finger-nose-finger and heel-shin tests are performed on both sides, and ataxia is scored only if present out of proportion to weakness. Ataxia is absent in the patient who cannot understand or is paralyzed. Only in the case of amputation or joint fusion, the examiner should record the score as untestable (UN), and clearly write the explanation for this choice. In case of blindness, test by having the patient touch nose from extended arm position. 0 = absent 1 = present in one limb 2 = present in two limbs UN = amputation or joint fusion, explain: ________________  8. SensorySensation or grimace to pinprick when tested, or withdrawal from noxious stimulus in the obtunded or aphasic patient. Only sensory loss attributed to stroke is scored as abnormal and the examiner should test as many body areas (arms [not hands], legs, trunk, face) as needed to accurately check for hemisensory loss. A score of 2, “severe or total sensory loss,” should only be given when a severe or total loss of sensation can be clearly demonstrated. Stuporous and aphasic patients will, therefore, probably score 1 or 0. The patient with brainstem stroke who has bilateral loss of sensation is scored 2. If the patient does not respond and is quadriplegic, score 2. Patients in a coma (item 1a=3) are automatically given a 2 on this item.  0 = normal; no sensory loss 1 = mild-to-moderate sensory loss; patient feels pinprick is less sharp or is dull on the affected side; or there is a loss of superficial pain with pinprick, but patient is aware of being touched 2 = severe to total sensory loss; patient is not aware of being touched in the face, arm, and leg 9. Best languageA great deal of information about comprehension will be obtained during the preceding sections of the examination. For this scale item, the patient is asked to describe what is happening in the attached picture, to name the items on the attached naming sheet and to read from the attached list of sentences. Comprehension is judged from responses here, as well as to all of the commands in the preceding general neurological exam. If visual loss interferes with the tests, ask the patient to identify objects placed in the hand, repeat, and produce speech. The intubated patient should be asked to write. The patient in a coma (item 1a=3) will automatically score 3 on this item. The examiner must choose a score for the patient with stupor or limited cooperation, but a score of 3 should be used only if the patient is mute and follows no one-step commands.  0 = no aphasia; normal 1 = mild-to-moderate aphasia; some obvious loss of fluency or facility of comprehension, without significant limitation on ideas expressed or form of expression; reduction of speech and/or comprehension, however, makes conversation about provided materials difficult or impossible; for example, in conversation about provided materials, examiner can identify picture or naming card content from patient’s response 2 = severe aphasia; all communication is through fragmentary expression; great need for inference, questioning, and guessing by the listener; range of information that can be exchanged is limited; listener carries burden of communication; examiner cannot identify materials provided from patient response 3 = mute, global aphasia; no usable speech or auditory comprehension 10. DysarthriaIf patient is thought to be normal, an adequate sample of speech must be obtained by asking patient to read or repeat words from the attached list. If the patient has severe aphasia, the clarity of articulation of spontaneous speech can be rated. Only if the patient is intubated or has other physical barriers to producing speech, the examiner should record the score as untestable (UN), and clearly write an explanation for this choice. Do not tell the patient why he or she is being tested. 0 = normal 1 = mild-to-moderate dysarthria; patient slurs at least some words and, at worst, can be understood with some difficulty 2 = severe dysarthria; patient's speech is so slurred as to be unintelligible in the absence of or out of proportion to any dysphasia, or is mute/anarthric. UN = Intubated or other physical barrier, explain:_____________________________  11. Extinction and inattention (formerly neglect)Sufficient information to identify neglect may be obtained during the prior testing. If the patient has a severe visual loss preventing visual double simultaneous stimulation, and the cutaneous stimuli are normal, the score is normal. If the patient has aphasia but does appear to attend to both sides, the score is normal. The presence of visual spatial neglect or anosagnosia may also be taken as evidence of abnormality. Since the abnormality is scored only if present, the item is never untestable.  0 = no abnormality 1 = visual, tactile, auditory, spatial, or personal inattentionor extinction to bilateral simultaneous stimulation in one of the sensory modalities 2 = profound hemi-inattention or extinction to more than one modality; does not recognize own hand or orients to only one side of space

The first/medial cuneiform bone also is joined to the navicular by the medial cuneonavicular ligament 3. Blood supplyA branch of dorsalis pedis artery gives off three to five smaller branches which supply the navicular from the medial side. On the lateral aspect of the bone, small branches from the posterior tibial artery. Branches of the medial plantar artery also supply the plantar surface of the bone 4. In the central navicular there is a region of watershed blood supply which predisposes the bone to stress fractures.Variant anatomyAn accessory ossicle can be present on the medial aspect of the navicular known as an accessory navicular.DevelopmentAbnormalities of the ossification of the navicular can be common. The navicular is the last bone in the foot to ossify.

__label__Trauma __label__Musculoskeletal Navicular fractures along with cuboid fractures form the most common isolated mid-foot fractures.  On this page:  Article: Clinical presentation Pathology Radiographic features Treatment and prognosis References   Images:Cases and figures  Clinical presentationMay present with pain, swelling or hematoma directly over the mid-foot. Stress fractures in athletes and construction workers may present with vague pain and swelling over the mid-foot which worsens with exercise. Patients generally have normal range of motion and a normal neurovascular examination 1.PathologyThe fracture occurs via two main mechanisms: chronic overuse injuries causing a stress fracture (often in athletes) acute trauma ClassificationThe Sangeorzan classification is used to assess the severity of isolated navicular fractures and to determine management:  type I: the fracture line is in the coronal plane and there is no angulation of the forefoot  type II: the fracture line is dorsal-lateral to plantar-medial and the forefoot is medially displaced  type III: there is a comminuted fracture in the sagittal plane and the forefoot is displaced laterally 4  Radiographic featuresPlain radiographPlain radiographs are the best initial test in a suspected navicular fracture. Their sensitivity for identifying navicular fracture is low, however lateral and oblique radiographs provide the greatest chance of identifying a fracture. Rarely fractures of an accessory navicular bone (if present) are also possible and may be visible.CTCT is more sensitive for identifying navicular fractures. It also allows for the assessment of the extent of the fracture line and the degree of communition.MRI T2: may demonstrate areas of hyperintensity over the fracture site indicating bone edemaIt should be noted that MRI is more sensitive than CT however in identifying stress fractures 3.Treatment and prognosisDisplaced type I and II fractures typically require open reduction and internal fixation with screw lag fixation. Type II fractures require open reduction and internal fixation followed by external fixation. Undisplaced fractures can be managed conservatively in a cast 3.

It can occur with both salt water and fresh water near-drowning.PathologyIt is thought to result from the inhalation of either fresh water or sea water resulting in lung damage and a ventilation-perfusion mismatch.Near drowning can be divided into three stages:  stage 1: acute laryngospasm that occurs after inhalation of a small amount of water  stage 2: the victim still usually presents with laryngospasm but may begin to swallow water into the stomach  stage 3 10-15% of patients still present with dry drowning caused by persistence of the associated laryngospasm in the remaining 85-90% of patients, the laryngospasm relaxes secondary to hypoxia and large amounts of water are aspirated   Radiographic featuresRadiographyFeatures in stages 2 and 3 on chest radiographs are usually identical to pulmonary edema from other non-cardiac causes 3.
__label__Head __label__& __label__Neck Neck dissection, also known as cervical lymphadenectomy, is the surgical procedure for the management of metastatic cervical lymphadenopathy. There are multiple types of neck dissection that vary by the structures removed 1. This article reflects the 2001 classification by the American Head and Neck Society and the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery 1,2.ClassificationRadical neck dissectionRadical neck dissection is the historical standard by which subsequent approaches are compared and defined. The radical neck dissection involves removal of all ipsilateral cervical lymph nodes from levels I through V, as well as the submandibular gland.Three key extranodal structures are also removed: spinal accessory nerve sternocleidomastoid muscle internal jugular vein Modified radical neck dissectionModified radical neck dissection involves removal of levels I through V, as in classical radical neck dissection, but with preservation of one or more of the key extranodal structures (spinal accessory nerve, sternocleidomastoid muscle, and internal jugular vein). Although previously grouped by types (I through III), variation in practice makes it advisable to name explicitly the structures spared in a modified radical neck dissection (e.g. modified radical neck dissection with preservation of the spinal accessory nerve).Selective neck dissectionSelective neck dissection involves removal of some but not all of the lymph node groups removed in the radical neck dissection.Historically, there were named subtypes of selective neck dissections: supraomohyoid: levels I-IIIextended supraomohyoid (anterolateral): levels I-IV  posterolateral: levels II-V, suboccipital, postauricular lateral (jugular): levels II-IV anterior (central): level VI Due to evolving practices, the 2001 classification omitted the named subtypes in favor of precise description with "SND" and parentheses denoting the levels removed, e.g. SND (I-IV).The lymph nodes groups/levels typically removed depends on expected patterns of metastatic spread from a given primary site 2: oral cavity: levels I-IIIsome surgeons also include some or all of level IV  oropharynx, hypopharynx, larynx: levels II-IV excluding level IIB in some cases of laryngeal or hypopharyngeal cancer plus retropharyngeal nodes if the primary lesion involves the pharyngeal wall plus level VI if the primary lesion extends below the glottis level plus superior mediastinal nodes if the primary lesion extends below the suprasternal notch level   thyroid: level VI skin of posterior scalp and upper neck: levels II-V, suboccipital, postauricular skin of preauricular, anterior scalp, temporal region: levels II-III, level VA, parotid, facial, external jugular skin of anterior and lateral face: levels I-III, parotid, facial Dissections are performed bilaterally if the primary lesion crosses the midline.Extended radical neck dissectionExtended radical neck dissection involves removal of levels I through V and key nonnodal structures (spinal accessory nerve, sternocleidomastoid muscle, and internal jugular vein), as in classical radical neck dissection, but with removal of one or more additional lymph node groups and/or non-lymphatic structures.Such nodal groups include: suboccipital nodes retropharyngeal nodes parotid nodes facial nodes (e.g. buccinator nodes) level VI (e.g. paratracheal nodes, Delphian node, perithyroidal nodes) superior mediastinal nodes Possible nonlymphatic structures include: carotid artery hypoglossal nerve vagus nerve paraspinal muscles 
__label__Oncology __label__Head __label__& __label__Neck NI-RADS (Neck Imaging and Reporting and Data System) is a lexicon and risk classification proposed by the American College of Radiology for reporting surveillance imaging of treated head and neck cancer. The terminology and categories may be applied to any head and neck malignancy (e.g. squamous cell carcinoma, mucoepidermoid carcinoma), and are intended to direct clinical management.This article reflects revisions published in the 2018 ACR white paper 1. On this page:  Article: Background Imaging frequency Imaging findings Management recommendations Performance See also References   BackgroundStandardized reporting systems (e.g. BI-RADS, LI-RADS) are designed to improve communication between radiologists, referring clinicians, and/or patients, in areas of high clinical impact. In head and neck oncology, imaging is primarily used to monitor for disease recurrence following initial treatment. Thus, NI-RADS was developed to address whether or not imaging demonstrates evidence of tumor recurrence 2.The primary purpose of NI-RADS is to provide a framework for consistent reporting across readers and institutions. The framework consists of a standardized terminology and 4-tier classification, used to support direct management recommendations.NI-RADS is intended for contrast-enhanced cross-sectional imaging (i.e. CT or MRI), with or without FDG-PET/CT. While protocols for the timing of post-treatment imaging vary by institution, surveillance may begin as early as 8-12 weeks post-treatment 1.Imaging frequencyAs there is no universal algorithm to direct timing/frequency of post-treatment imaging, NI-RADS advocates following institution-defined protocols in order to maintain consistency. NI-RADS suggests timing for surveillance imaging in head and neck squamous cell carcinomas: first post-treatment (baseline) 8-12 weeks after treatment, CT neck and PET/CT if negative...   second post-treatment 6 month after last imaging, CT neck and chest or (CT and PET/CT) if PET/CT negative... no need for further surveillance if CT negative...    third post-treatment 6 months after last imaging, CT neck if CT negative...   four post-treatment12 months after last imaging, CT neck and chest  If the primary tumor is near or involving the skull base, MRI should be used instead of CT neck for evaluation of soft tissue/perineural involvement.Category descriptorsThe primary tumor site and neck lymph nodes are scored separately based on imaging suspicion of recurrence. Primary designator "X" can be used for an unknown primary.  NI-RADS 0: incomplete (prior imaging unavailable, but will be obtained)  NI-RADS 1: no evidence of recurrence  NI-RADS 2: low suspicion of recurrence  2a: superficial mucosal  2b: deep    NI-RADS 3: high suspicion of recurrence ("can and should be biopsied")  NI-RADS 4: known recurrence NI-RADS 0 refers to a new baseline study in which prior comparison imaging is unavailable at the time of interpretation and will be procured in the future. If prior imaging cannot be obtained, the NI-RADS category and management decisions should be assigned based on available information.NI-RADS 4 refers to recurrence that is either proven pathologically or considered definite by imaging or clinical criteria.Imaging findingsCT NI-RADS 1 primary site expected post-treatment changes with non-mass-like distortion of soft tissues low-density submucosal/mucosal edema (post-radiation edema) diffuse curvilinear mucosal enhancement (especially after radiation, i.e. radiation mucositis)   neckno nodal enlargement or new suspicious morphology (necrosis, extra-nodal extension)    NI-RADS 2 primary site 2a: non-mass-like, focal, mucosal enhancement 2b: non-mass-like, ill-defined, deep soft tissue with only mild differential enhancement   neckenlarging node(s), without new suspicious morphology (necrosis, extra-nodal extension)    NI-RADS 3 primary site new or enlarging discrete soft tissue with intense differential enhancement +/- osseous erosion 5    neckenlarging node(s), with new necrosis or gross extranodal extension    PET NI-RADS 1 primary site no abnormal FDG uptake diffuse curvilinear mucosal FDG uptake after radiation (benign radiation mucositis)   neckno FDG avidity of residual nodes    NI-RADS 2 primary site 2a: mild focal mucosal FDG uptake  2b: mild FDG uptake to ill-defined deep soft tissue   neckmild FDG uptake to residual nodes    NI-RADS 3 primary siteintense focal FDG uptake to discrete nodule/mass  neckintense FDG uptake to residual, new, or enlarging nodes    When there is discordance between CT and PET, the NI-RADS category should be assigned to the lower of the adjacent scores. For example, when there is ill-defined deep soft tissue without any FDG uptake, the NI-RADS category is 1. When there is focal intense FDG uptake without discrete mass, the NI-RADS category is 2. When there is a discrete enhancing mass with at most moderate FDG uptake, the NI-RADS category is 2. Only when CT and PET are concordant for highly suspicious features is the NI-RADS category 3 assigned.Management recommendationsEach NI-RADS category carries a management recommendation. Considering the most prudent next step in management is helpful when deciding on a NI-RADS category for borderline findings. These recommendations are as follows: NI-RADS 0: obtain prior imaging examinations, after which a score can be assigned in an addendum NI-RADS 1: continue routine surveillance NI-RADS 2a: direct visual inspection of area of concern NI-RADS 2b: additional PET or short-interval (3 month) follow-up with CT NI-RADS 3: biopsy (image-guided or clinical) area of concern NI-RADS 4: treatment of disease (with or without biopsy) PerformanceNI-RADS demonstrates good risk stratification. Rates of persistent or recurrent head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (as demonstrated on biopsy, subsequent imaging, or physical examination) have been reported by NI-RADS category 3,4: NI-RADS 1: 4% NI-RADS 2: 15-17% NI-RADS 3: 59% See also Hopkins criteria for head and neck cancer therapy response interpretation using FDG PET/CT RADS (Reporting and Data Systems)

__label__Musculoskeletal Necrotizing fasciitis (rare plural: necrotizing fasciitides) refers to a rapidly progressive and often fatal necrotizing soft tissue infection primarily involving and spreading along the fascia. On this page:  Article: Terminology Epidemiology Clinical presentation Pathology Radiographic features Treatment and prognosis Differential diagnosis History and etymology See also References   Images: Cases and figures Imaging differential diagnosis   TerminologyAs fascia is variably defined, there can be confusion as to what constitutes fasciitis. While anatomy texts often define superficial fascia as including the subcutaneous fat layer, the latest international nomenclature, Terminologia Anatomica, abandoned the term and most surgeons consider "fascia" to refer primarily to the deep (investing) fascia 3,10. Therefore, findings of infection in the subcutaneous tissue is usually considered part of cellulitis, while fasciitis is reserved for the involvement of the deep fascia 10.EpidemiologyNecrotizing fasciitis is relatively rare, although its prevalence is thought to be rising.Risk factorsThe most common risk factor is diabetes mellitus, especially in combination with peripheral arterial disease. Other predisposing factors include immunocompromise due to HIV infection, cancer, alcoholism, and organ transplants. However, infections can occur in otherwise healthy individuals following surgery, penetrating trauma, minor wounds such as insect bites or abrasions, or even blunt trauma with no clear portal of entry 7,15.Clinical presentationThe most common clinical findings overlap with that of non-necrotizing soft tissue infection, including local edema and erythema 15. Findings that are more concerning for necrotizing infection include acute onset severe pain, crepitus, skin necrosis, bullae and signs of systemic toxicity/sepsis such as fever and hypotension 15. Necrotizing fasciitis is ultimately a surgical diagnosis, based on direct inspection of friable superficial fascia and foul grey "dishwater" exudate 15.PathologyMicrobiologically, there are two major recognized forms: polymicrobial (type I): most common; involves both anaerobic and aerobic organisms, such as Clostridium, Bacteroides, and Peptostreptococcus in the former group, and Enterobacteriaceae family members and Staphylococcus aureus in the latter group 14  monomicrobial (type II): less common (10-15%); most commonly involves group A streptococci, the “flesh-eating bacteria” and may be complicated by toxic shock syndrome 3,4; less commonly due to Staphylococcus aureus  The presence of anaerobes (or facultative anaerobes) in type I infection is responsible for the hallmark finding of gas formation found later in the course of polymicrobial necrotizing fasciitis. However, the finding is not present in monomicrobial necrotizing fasciitis due to group A streptococci.LocationWhile it can affect any part of the body, 50% of cases involve the lower extremities. Other common areas include the upper extremities, the perineum (Fournier gangrene), and head and neck region 4,12. In neonates, the most common area involved is the trunk 15.Radiographic featuresImaging is more sensitive than physical exam for detecting the hallmark feature of soft tissue gas (subcutaneous emphysema) and can also identify findings contributing to infection such as foreign bodies 12. However, no imaging modality can exclude the diagnosis with certainty and a study with only non-specific evidence of soft tissue inflammation should not preclude or delay surgical exploration and intervention in cases with high clinical suspicion for necrotizing infection.Plain filmRadiographs can be normal until the advanced stages of infection and necrosis. Early findings are non-specific, similar to those of cellulitis, such as increased soft-tissue thickness and opacity. Soft tissue gas is seen in only a minority of cases.CTCT is the most commonly used imaging modality for evaluation of suspected necrotizing fasciitis 12. The sensitivity of CT is 80%, but the specificity is low given overlapping features with non-necrotizing fasciitis 12. Gas within fluid collections tracking along fascial planes is the most specific finding but is not always present 12.Other, non-specific findings include: asymmetrical fascial thickening associated with fat stranding edema extending into the intermuscular septa and the muscle thickening of one or both of the superficial and deep fascial layers Although fascial fluid collections are typically non-focal, abscesses may be seen. On contrast enhanced CT, diffuse enhancement of fascia can be seen but is present in both necrotizing or non-necrotizing fasciitis 8,10. On the other hand, absent enhancement of the thickened fascia suggests necrosis 7.UltrasoundUltrasound may be more useful in children 4,10 (with a rising incidence after primary varicella infection 11). Sonographic findings include distorted and thickened fascial planes with turbid fluid accumulation in the fascial layers and subcutaneous edema. Soft tissue gas appears as a layer of echogenic foci with posterior dirty shadowing 12.MRIMRI is the gold standard imaging modality for the investigation of necrotizing fasciitis with a sensitivity of 93% 12. Findings include 10,12:  T2 FS or STIR fascial thickening ≥3 mm and hyperintensity, starting in the superficial fascia and often involving deep intramuscular fascia in multiple compartments subfascial and interfascial fluid collections low signal foci of gas subcutaneous edema, although commonly seen with cellulitis as well    T1 subtle loss of muscle texture and possible high signal intensity compatible with intramuscular hemorrhage low signal foci of gas    T1 C+ ​variable fascial contrast enhancement: increased early due to capillary permeability but absent later due to necrosis  Treatment and prognosisNecrotizing fasciitis is a surgical emergency. Definitive diagnosis and treatment involves prompt surgical fasciotomy with aggressive debridement of the necrotic tissue. Antibiotics are started with broad spectrum coverage, including anaerobes, and tailored when culture data are available. Subsequent repeat (second look) surgery is necessary until no necrotic tissue is found. Any delay in treatment may cause extensive soft tissue loss and loss of limb. Amputation may be required to pre-empt further spread of infection. Mortality rates can range between 9-25% 17.Differential diagnosisFor soft tissue inflammatory findings, consider 12,13: non-necrotizing fasciitis, cellulitis, and/or myositis  ischemic myonecrosis  dermatomyositis graft versus host disease For gas within soft tissues, consider: gas gangrene (clostridial myonecrosis) penetrating trauma or percutaneous/surgical procedure communication from the aerodigestive tract (e.g. pneumomediastinum, esophageal perforation) History and etymologyThe entity was described by Hippocrates in the 5th century BC as a complication of erysipelas, termed hospital gangrene in a large series by Joseph Jones (an American army surgeon during the American Civil War), and finally called "necrotizing fasciitis" in 1952 in an article by B Wilson 18.See alsosubcutaneous abscess
__label__Head __label__& __label__Neck Necrotizing otitis externa (NOE), also known as malignant otitis externa, is a severe invasive infection of the external auditory canal (EAC) which can spread rapidly to involve the surrounding soft tissue, adjacent neck spaces and skull base.  On this page:  Article: Pathology Radiographic features Differential diagnosis See also References   Images:Cases and figures  PathologyPredisposing conditions for NOE include diabetes and immunosuppression (i.e., diabetes or patients receiving chemo- and/or radiation therapy), and is usually seen in elderly patients. Pain can be out of proportion for typical otitis externa.Pseudomonas aeruginosa is the pathogen in 98% of cases. The route by which the infection spreads is variable. It can spread anteroinferiorly to involve the suprahyoid neck spaces (parotid space and masticator space). Alternatively, the infection can also erode the cartilaginous-bone of the EAC resulting in a direct intracranial spread with resultant serious intracranial complications. Serious complications include:  skull base osteomyelitis  subdural empyema cerebral abscess meningitis facial nerve palsy temporomandibular joint involvement  dural venous sinus thrombophlebitis  Radiographic featuresCTOn contrast-enhanced CT, there can be thickening and enhancing soft tissue and sometimes cortical bone erosion in the region of the external auditory canal with or without formation of phlegmon/abscess. In cases of abscess, cartilaginous bone ring enhancing collection with a necrotic low attenuation center can be observed.Necrotizing otitis externa may be associated with inflammatory changes within adjacent structures such as the periauricular soft tissues, nasopharynx and parapharyngeal space. Additionally there may be opacification of the mastoid air cells and middle ear from direct extension 5. Potential complications include skull base erosion with intracranial spread of infection. Nuclear medicineTechnetium-99m bone scanning is sensitive to osteoblastic activity and is highly sensitive for bony infection, with uptake in the temporal bone and skull base differentiating NOE from typical acute otitis externa 4.Follow up imaging using gallium-67 citrate and indium-111 labeled leukocyte scans, in addition to serum ESR levels can gauge treatment response 4.Differential diagnosisImaging findings can be misinterpreted as a malignancy.

__label__Gastrointestinal Necrotizing pancreatitis (NP) represents a severe form of acute pancreatitis. It is considered a subtype of acute pancreatitis as necrosis usually tends to occur early, within the first 24-48 hours, but can also rarely occur with subacute forms.A key feature is a significant amount of pancreatic and peripancreatic tissue necrosis associated with pancreatitis. On this page:  Article: Epidemiology Pathology Radiographic features Treatment and prognosis Practical points Related articles References   Images:Cases and figures  EpidemiologyAround 5-10% of patients with interstitial edematous pancreatitis (i.e. uncomplicated acute pancreatitis) will develop necrosis 5. PathologyNecrotizing pancreatitis may become infected in up to 40% cases 6, more commonly after the first week. Radiographic featuresNP presents most often as necrosis affecting both the pancreas and peripancreatic tissues. Rarely it will affect only the peripancreatic tissues or pancreas in isolation 5.CTAreas of necrosis are seen as non-enhancing low attenuating regions within the pancreas best observed if a dual phase pancreatic study is performed.Foci of gas may also be present in more extreme cases; extraluminal gas is highly suggestive of superimposed infection (see: emphysematous pancreatitis). Treatment and prognosisThe presence of necrosis implies a poorer prognosis with mortality rates reported up to 14% 3, if sterile.

__label__Interventional __label__Vascular The needle gauge system, often called just the Gauge or G, is an internationally-used scale for sizing needles. It was adopted from pre-existing gauges which were used in industry to size metal wire.In contradistinction to the French scale, the other well-known sizing system, which is a metric system, the Gauge size cannot be derived from a straightforward formula. This is because the size was not designed to be an absolute measure, but instead a relative scale. Moreover, as the Gauge number increases, the needle caliber decreases.The lowest and highest allowable gauges are pre-defined and published tables state the sizing of every available gauge. Attempts have been made to replace the gauge system with a logical, modern system, but have gained no traction until now 1.Gauge sizingThe history of the gauge is surprisingly long and complex, and outside the scope of this article. However, an appreciation of it is the best way to understand why the scale appears so counter-intuitive from a modern scientific perspective 1.The gauge originally arose as a method for measuring the thickness of metal wire, in particular, iron wire. For centuries, wire was manufactured by a process known as 'drawing'. The process of wire-making started with a thick wire, and thinner wires were made by pulling (or drawing) the wire through progressively smaller holes. The size of the largest wire that one could start with was limited by the force that could be generated to pull it through a smaller hole. In the pre-steam age, the greatest force could be supplied by horse or a water-wheel.Originally the largest wire was given the designation of 1 G, and then for each successively smaller caliber, the gauge number was increased by one. Therefore as the wires get smaller, the gauge number increases. However, as later technology (e.g. steam power) permitted larger wires to be used as the starting needle in the drawing process, the scale had to be extended downwards. To avoid negative numbers the gauges greater than 1 were designated 0, 1/0, 2/0 etc.Each wire-maker would have a standard metal gauge for their customers' use by which they could choose the thickness of wire they might require and also verify that their purchased wire was of the stated size. This system did not require any absolute measurement of the wire thickness. Indeed in the pre-industrial era, technology was not yet sophisticated enough to perform accurate, consistent measuring. This explains why the system is comparative and not absolute.When the UK became the first country in the world to standardize a gauge system in 1884, an attempt was made to make the increments between the gauge numbers more regular. This system was known as the British Standard Wire Gauge, and it was developed from the older Birmingham gauge system.  Although there is not an equal increment between each step in the system, the caliber decreases by ≈11% per increment. 
__label__Musculoskeletal The Neer classification of distal clavicular fractures along with the AO classification system is one of the more frequently used classification systems when assessing distal clavicular fractures. The classification system, broken into five categories communicates both the stability and treatment recommendation of the fracture focusing on the relationship of the fracture to coracoclavicular ligaments and the acromioclavicular joint.Type IConsidered a stable fracture requiring nonoperative treatment minimally displaced fracture line sits lateral to the coracoclavicular ligaments trapezoid and/or conoid ligament intact Type IIAConsidered an unstable fracture requiring operative treatment fracture is medial to the coracoclavicular ligament with significant displacement of the medial portion conoid ligament intact  trapezoid ligament intact Type IIBConsidered an unstable fracture requiring operative treatment the fracture occurs between coracoclavicular ligament resulting in the conoid ligament torn and the trapezoid ligament intact.

__label__Musculoskeletal __label__Trauma The Neer classification of proximal humeral fractures is probably the most frequently used system along with the AO classification of proximal humeral fractures. The terminology and factors which influence the classification are essential for the utility of radiological reports of proximal humeral fractures.The two main components of the classification are the number of fracture parts and the displacement 1,4-6.The Neer system divides the proximal humerus into four parts and considers not the fracture line, but the displacement as being significant in terms of classification. The four parts are the humeral head, the greater tuberosity, the lesser tuberosity and the humeral shaft. Displacement is on a per-part basis. A fracture part is considered displaced if angulation exceeds 45 degrees, or if the fracture is displaced by more than 1 cm 1.The simplest displaced fracture which is possible is a two-part fracture, however, a minimally displaced fracture, even one that includes multiple fracture lines, merely constitutes a type I, one-part fracture.ClassificationThe Neer classification has been variably adapted by multiple authors. The classification consists of four major groupings, based on the number of displaced parts. Neer added a fifth group 9 more recently.One-part fracture fracture lines involve 1-4 parts none of the parts are displaced (i.e <1 cm and <45 degrees) These non-displaced or minimally displaced fractures account for ~70-80% of all proximal humeral fractures and are almost always treated conservatively 6,7.Two-part fracture fracture lines involve 2-4 parts one part is displaced (i.e >1 cm or >45 degrees) Four possible types of two-part fractures exist (one for each part):  surgical neck: most common greater tuberosity frequently seen in the setting of anterior shoulder dislocation 8  a lower threshold of displacement (>5 mm) has been proposed 8    anatomical neck lesser tuberosity: uncommon These fractures account for approximately 20% of proximal humeral fractures 6.Three-part fracture fracture lines involve 3-4 parts two parts are displaced (i.e >1 cm or >45 degrees) Two three-part fracture patterns are encountered 7: greater tuberosity and shaft are displaced with respect to the lesser tuberosity and articular surface which remain togethermost common three part pattern  lesser tuberosity and shaft are displaced with respect to the greater tuberosity and articular surface which remain together These fractures account for approximately 5% of proximal humeral fractures 6.Four-part fracture fracture lines involve more than 4 parts three parts are displaced (i.e., >1 cm or >45 degrees) with respect to the 4th  These fractures are uncommon (<1% of proximal humeral fractures) 6.This pattern has poor non-operative results, and as the articular surface is no longer attached to any parts of the humerus which are attached to soft tissues. This pattern has a high incidence of osteonecrosis 7.These fractures require operative management.Valgus impacted four-part fractureThis type of four part fracture is considered its own category and has a different prognosis than typical four part fractures 9.

__label__Musculoskeletal Negative ulnar variance describes a state where the ulna is abnormally shortened compared to the radius and plays an important role in wrist pathology.There is a significant association between negative ulnar variance and Kienböck disease, although the majority of people with negative ulnar variance do not have this condition. A causal association is difficult to prove, however the effectiveness of decompressive procedures such as radial shortening or ulnar lengthening in relieving pain and preventing further collapse of the lunate supports this 1.Ulnar impingement syndrome, a wrist condition caused by a shortened distal ulna impinging on the distal radius proximal to the sigmoid notch of radius, is usually due to acquired ulnar shortening but can be due to de novo negative ulnar variance 2.See also ulnar variancepositive ulnar variance

__label__Head __label__& __label__Neck Nelson syndrome is a rare disorder observed in patients with Cushing disease that have undergone bilateral adrenalectomy. It involves enlargement of an existing adrenocorticotropic hormone-secreting pituitary tumor, typically an adenoma, after surgical resection of the adrenal glands.  On this page:  Article: Epidemiology Clinical presentation Pathology Radiographic features Treatment and prognosis History and etymology References   EpidemiologyStudies have found a huge variation in the incidence of Nelson syndrome. Incidence rates have varied from 6-47% in adults to 25-66% in pediatric populations undergoing bilateral adrenalectomy 1. It has been identified that the incidence increases with follow-up time 1. The presence of high basal adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) is the best predictor for development of Nelson syndrome 1. Clinical presentationThe following clinical features may be observed 1:  skin hyperpigmentation, because melanocyte-stimulating hormone (MSH) and ACTH share the same precursor molecule, proopiomelanocortin (POMC) headaches, due to displacement of meninges visual field deficits (e.g. bitemporal hemianopia), due to compression of the optic chiasm   diabetes insipidus, due to compression of posterior pituitary  altered sensation over V1 and V2 sensory areas, due to direct invasion of the cavernous sinus  sudden intracranial hypertension, due to necrosis (usually a late sign) PathologyPresumably, Nelson syndrome represents accelerated growth of an existing ACTH-secreting pituitary microadenoma due to the loss of the normal adrenal negative feedback mechanisms. Microscopic appearanceThe tumors stain positive for ACTH and MSH, similar to pituitary adenomas observed in Cushing disease. The tumors are PAS positive. Radiographic featuresMRI is the preferred imaging modality for Nelson syndrome. To establish a diagnosis of Nelson syndrome, a steady growth of the tumor needs to be demonstrated. This can be established with high resolution T1- and T2-weighted images and application of gadolinium contrast, see: pituitary microadenoma.Treatment and prognosisSurgical resection of the pituitary adenoma is the gold-standard treatment for Nelson syndrome. If neurosurgery cannot be performed, radiation therapy is the next best management option. Some studies have shown that gamma knife surgery may also be effective 2. History and etymologyThis syndrome was first reported by Nelson et al. in 1958 3.

It shouldn't be at or above the GEJ, but rather projected over the stomach  UAC (umbilical arterial catheter): it's the one that dips down into the pelvis and should have a tip above (T6-9) or below (L2-5) the renal arteries and unpaired aortic branches  UVC (umbilical venous catheter): it should enter at the level of the umbilicus and head north with its tip at the RA/IVC junction - not in the hepatic veins (right hand side) or portal vein (left hand side)  peripheral line (PICC): from arm, leg or scalp (!)

Consequently, both terms are frequently used as synonyms. EpidemiologyHypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy is one of the most common causes of cerebral palsy and other severe neurological deficits in children, occurring in 2-9 of every 1000 live births.Clinical presentationThe encephalopathic neonate may have low Apgar scores at delivery and metabolic acidosis documented in the cord blood. Within the first 24 hours of life, the infant may develop symptoms of apnea and seizures with abnormal electroencephalographic (EEG) results.PathologyThe lack of sufficient blood flow, in conjunction with decreased oxygen content in the blood (perinatal asphyxia), leads to loss of normal cerebral autoregulation and diffuse brain injury. The exact nature of the injury depends on the severity of hypotension and the degree of brain maturation. In general, the myelinated areas are more metabolically active and express more glutamate receptors (NMDA receptors), which make them more vulnerable to HIE due to excitotoxicity.Radiographic featuresIn term infants blood flow is ventriculofugal and changes are mainly, like in older children, in watershed-border zones; namely, parasagittal grey matter and subcortical white matter. Profound HIE in term babies results in thalamic and basal ganglia as well as sensorimotor cortex (perirolandic region) injury.UltrasoundSonography is sensitive for the detection of hemorrhage, periventricular leukomalacia, and hydrocephalus. Resistive index (RI) of the middle cerebral arteries, if correlated with gestational age, can add more information. Severe HIE results in loss of autoregulation and increased RI.CTCT is the least sensitive modality for evaluation of HIE because of poor parenchymal contrast resolution in the neonatal brain due to the high water content of the parenchyma and high protein content of the CSF.MRIMRI is the most sensitive and specific imaging technique for examining infants with suspected hypoxic-ischemic brain injury. Conventional sequences can help exclude other causes of encephalopathy such as hemorrhage, cerebral infarction, neoplasms, or congenital malformations.A number of patterns of injury are encountered (see patterns of neonatal hypoxic-ischemic brain injury) depending on the stage of brain maturation and severity of asphyxia, with the following expected signal intensity changes:  T1 grey matter: hyperintense white matter: hypointense    T2 grey matter: variable depending on the time of imaging and presence of hemorrhage white matter: hyperintense    DWI/ADC diffusion restriction first week  ADC pseudonormalization occurs at the end of the first week   Treatment and prognosisIncreased severity of encephalopathy is indicated by the presence of cortical and basal ganglia abnormalities on conventional MR images, on diffusion-weighted MR images, and at MR spectroscopy. Severe EEG abnormalities also portend a poor outcome.Although term infants with mild encephalopathy generally make a full recovery, 20% of affected infants die in the neonatal period and another 25% develop significant neurologic sequelae. For preterm infants, compared with term infants, the overall prognosis is worse.Studies estimate a short therapeutic window of 2-6 hours during which interventions may be efficacious in reducing the severity of ultimate brain injury; thus, early identification of a neonate who has sustained a hypoxic-ischemic insult is a paramount objective for optimal management and treatment.
__label__Breast __label__Paediatrics Neonatal mastitis is rare and refers to infection of the breast tissue occurring in a neonate. On this page:  Article: Clinical presentation Pathology Radiographic features Treatment and prognosis References   Images:Imaging differential diagnosis  Clinical presentationPatients may present with unilateral breast erythema and pain sometimes with associated nipple discharge and lymphadenopathy. It usually occurs in patients under five weeks of age, with a peak incidence around three weeks of age. Systemic symptoms, such as fever, are not always present.PathologyNeonatal breast hypertrophy is common in newborns that is thought to be from declining levels of maternal estrogen triggering neonatal prolactin secretion Infection of this breast tissue results in mastitis.The most common causative organisms are Staphylococcus aureus (83-88% of cases), Escheria coli, Salmonella spp., anaerobes and Group B streptococcus. Radiographic featuresUltrasound poorly defined hyperechoic breast tissue with hyperemia with surrounding hypervascular, hyperechoic subcutaneous fat abscesses may appear as avascular hyper or anechoic areas with surrounding hyperemia Treatment and prognosisOral or parenteral antibiotic therapy is required. Breast abscess formation is the main complication from neonatal mastitis. Incision and drainage may also be necessary in cases of abscess formation.

__label__Chest __label__Paediatrics Neonatal pneumothorax describes pneumothoraces occurring in neonates. It is a life-threatening condition, associated with high morbidity and mortality. The diagnosis is a challenge especially when the amount of air is small and may accumulate along the anterior or medial pleural space. On this page:  Article: Epidemiology Clinical presentation Pathology Radiographic features Treatment and prognosis See also References   Images:Cases and figures  EpidemiologyOnly 0.5% of cases are symptomatic despite the high incidence. Studies show a male predilection. It is more commonly seen to occur within the first three days of life with more than 80% seen in the first 48 hours 3.Clinical presentationVariable from being completely asymptomatic to severe respiratory distress. Symptoms include dyspnea, cyanosis and chest pain. Physical examination may reveal decreased breath sounds, hyper-resonance to percussion on the afflicted side with contralateral tracheal deviation. When under tension, even cardiac function may be compromised.PathologyAir dissects from alveolar spaces into interstitial spaces of lung. The eventual migration of air to the visceral pleura culminates in rupture into the pleural cavity. It may also be accompanied by pneumomediastinum, pneumopericardium, pneumoperitoneum or subcutaneous emphysema.EtiologyIt may occur spontaneously, however, more commonly seen secondary to birth trauma, positive pressure ventilation, underlying obstructive or restrictive lung disease and rupture of a congenital or acquired cyst 4.Radiographic featuresTwo signs are useful in the diagnosis of a small pneumothorax  hyperlucent hemithorax sign in case of anterior pneumothorax  medial stripe sign in case of medial pneumothorax  ViewsThese signs can be appreciated in the supine position with additional views to confirm: hyperlucent hemithorax sign is seen as unilateral or bilateral areas of increased lucency confirmed on cross-table lateral view; the air will be seen to accumulate anteriorly medial stripe sign is seen as an area of increased lucency at the interface of the medial lung and the mediastinum which can be confirmed on lateral decubitus view; the air will be seen to rise and accumulate along the lateral chest wall Treatment and prognosisSmall, asymptomatic pneumothoraces are left alone and kept under close observation. Larger or symptomatic ones require drainage. Acute tension may be relieved with needle aspiration; chest tube or pigtail drainage may be placed afterwards for complete evacuation.See alsopneumothorax in adults

__label__Paediatrics The supine chest view of the neonatal patient is a common radiographic examination when examining preterm patients 1. Although not overall technically demanding, the radiographer should allocate time to ensure little to no repeats are required.Research surrounding the technical evaluation and technical parameters of the neonate chest x-ray is limited, with a high variation between departments and textbooks 2.

To prevent movement during the examination will often require a staff member, in lead protection, to stay in the room holding the patient (often at the arms and legs). If this is the case, careful instruction should be provided to that staff member regarding the goal of the examination. Research regarding the most effective method of neonatal immobilization is lacking; departmental protocols will vary.ConsentIt is imperative that the patient's family is acknowledged and respected. Often the parents of the newborn child will be in the room. One must ensure that there is an adequate introduction and explanation of the examination, ensuring the parents are comfortable with the procedure.
__label__Oncology __label__Gastrointestinal There are a number of neoplasms that can involve the vermiform appendix, some of which are peculiar to this site.EpidemiologyTumors involving the appendix have been found in only about 1% of all appendectomy specimens 9. Epithelial neoplasms and neuroendocrine tumors represent the vast majority of the tumors affecting the appendix. Clinical presentationSymptoms may vary from patients being completely asymptomatic, such as in small benign neuroendocrine tumors, to a clinical picture of acute appendicitis, which is reported in ~40% of cases and is most commonly seen associated with neuroendocrine tumors 9. Mucinous neoplasms can lead to abdominal pain, gastrointestinal obstruction, and abdominal distension when the complication pseudomyxoma peritonei has developed.Carcinoid syndrome related to malignant neuroendocrine tumors is rare, present in less than 5% of patients with this tumor.

__label__Urogenital __label__Central __label__Nervous __label__System __label__Musculoskeletal Nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF), also known as nephrogenic fibrosing dermopathy, is a complication of gadolinium-based contrast agents used in MRI.It is characterized by "firm, erythematous, and indurated plaques of the skin associated with subcutaneous edema" 1. Eventually, flexure contractures develop, with restriction to movement, pain and pruritus. Although the skin is primarily involved, many solid organs (e.g. lungs, heart, diaphragm, liver, and kidneys) can also be involved, eventually leading to death.Application of preventive guidelines on usage of gadolinium based contrast agents in patients with reduced renal function has been shown to be extremely effective in protection of patient from NSF 5. ScreeningPatients should be screened for the possible risk of developing NSF by using institutional screening questionnaires and calculating the eGFR 2: renal transplant (20% develop NSF): should have eGFR checked liver failure patients: should have eGFR checked outpatient screening (not on dialysis): eGFR use is controversial as they rarely develop NSF RecommendationsAvoid gadolinium-containing contrast agents in patients whose:eGFR is <30 mL/min/1.73 m2 ​Cautionary use of gadolinium-containing contrast agents in patients whose 1,3:eGFR is <60 mL/min/1.73 m2 "When contrast-enhanced MR imaging is requested for a patient with renal insufficiency who is hospitalized due to major surgery, major infection, or a thrombotic vascular event, alternative imaging is indicated to avoid the use of gadolinium-based contrast agents; this decision should be made after consultation with the referring service and the patient" 1.In cases where contrast still needs to be given 2: if eGFR <30 mL/min take informed consent (risk of NSF <1/10,000 patients with eGFR <30 mL/min) the maximum dose of 0.1 mmol/kg adequate hydration must be provided   if the patient is on dialysis: (inpatient) MRI should be done just before dialysis as the contrast can be removed by subsequent dialysis some centers consider dialysis a strict contraindication    On this page:  Article: Clinical presentation Pathology Radiographic features Treatment and prognosis Related articles References   Clinical presentation typically presents weeks to months after administration of Gd typically involves the dermis in the extremities symmetrically, less commonly the trunk with the face spared, typically sparing the antecubital and popliteal fossae  presentation resembles scleromyxedema or eosinophilic fasciitis skin lesions: hyperpigmented, thickened brawny induration joint contractures pain, pruritus, skin tightness or burning sensation PathologyThe development of NSF with exposure to gadolinium-containing MRI contrast agents has been strongly reported in patients with moderate to end-stage renal impairment. This could be due to transmetallation, which is the replacement of the gadolinium from the chelate and forming a free gadolinium ion, free gadolinium ions may then deposit in different tissues and result in inflammation and fibrosis. Low stability gadolinium contrast media show the strongest association with NSF 3. Additional positive risk factors include: concurrent infectious/inflammatory condition concurrent infarcted/ischemic tissue (e.g. peripheral arterial thromboembolism) recent surgery/trauma Histology deep dermal biopsy required however findings are non-specific: thickened collagen bundle, mucin deposition, spindle cell proliferation, CD3 + fibroblasts Contrast agentsThe medical literature review has shown that ~78% of all unconfounded, single-agent cases of NSF have been associated with Omniscan® (gadodiamide), while ~20% have been associated with Magnevist® (gadopentetate dimeglumine), and less than 2%, with OptiMARK® (gadoversetamide) 4.Radiographic features diffuse soft tissue tracer uptake on bone scans skin thickening and subcutaneous stranding on multiple modalities skin and muscle activity on PET Treatment and prognosis no consistently effective therapy improved renal function: renal transplant, recovery from acute renal failure (ARF)  physical therapy extracorporeal photopheresis, plasmapheresis, immunoglobulin therapy, steroids and other immunosuppressive agents

__label__Musculoskeletal The nerve to obturator internus and superior gemellus is formed from the anterior (ventral) divisions of the L5, S1 and S2 nerve roots of the sacral plexus. The nerve supplies the obturator internus and superior gemellus muscles as well as the fascia of the lateral side wall of the ischioanal fossa.Gross anatomyOriginThe nerve to obturator internus arises from the anterior divisions of the sacral plexus. It is formed from the L5-S2 nerve roots and exits the pelvis via the greater sciatic foramen inferior to the piriformis muscle and typically between the posterior cutaneous nerve of the thigh and the pudendal nerve.CourseAfter supplying a small branch to the gemellus superior muscle the nerve then travels laterally, loops around the ischial spine and passes through the lesser sciatic foramen to reenter the pelvis. The nerve innervates the obturator internus muscle from the medial surface of the muscle in the perineum.Variant anatomyIt has been noted in cadaveric studies that the nerve to quadratus femoris and obturator internus frequently arose from a common root and communication between these two nerves have been frequently observed. Various branching patterns to the gemelli have also been observed. The superior gemellus has been demonstrated to receive innervation from branches of the nerve to quadratus femoris as well as twigs from the communication of these two nerves. 
__label__Head __label__& __label__Neck The nerve to medial pterygoid or medial pterygoid nerve is a branch of the mandibular division of the trigeminal nerve.Gross anatomyThe nerve to medial pterygoid divides off the mandibular division just below the foramen ovale and just before it branches into anterior and posterior divisons. It has two small branches: one enters the deep surface of the medial pterygoid muscle and supplies it the other passes close to the otic ganglion and supplies the tensor veli palatini and tensor tympani muscles  
__label__Head __label__& __label__Neck The nerve to mylohyoid or mylohyoid nerve is a motor branch of the inferior alveolar nerve, a branch of the mandibular division of the trigeminal nerve.Gross anatomyThe nerve to mylohyoid arises from the inferior alveolar nerve just before it enters the mandibular foramen. It does not enter the foramen, rather it pierces the sphenomandibular ligament and runs anteroinferiorly in the mylohyoid groove of the mandible with its accompanying vessels, lateral to the medial pterygoid muscle. It courses under the mylohyoid muscle and then between it and the anterior belly of digastric above, supplying both these muscles.
__label__Musculoskeletal Nerve to the piriformis muscle also known as piriformis nerve arises from the S1 and S2 nerve roots of the sacral plexus. The nerve supplies the piriformis muscle.  On this page:  Article: Gross anatomy  Variant anatomy Related articles References   Images:Cases and figures  Gross anatomyOriginThe nerve to the piriformis muscle arises from the sacral plexus. The nerve branches from the posterior division of the ventral rami of the first and second sacral nerves. The piriformis occasionally receives a branch from the fifth lumbar nerve.CourseUnlike the majority of nerves that originate from the sacral plexus the nerve to piriformis remains within the pelvic cavity and pierces the anterior surface of the piriformis muscle. RelationsThe sciatic nerve is the largest branch of the sacral plexus and at its origin is closely related to the piriformis muscle. The nerve which receives contributions from L4-S3 forms on the anterior surface of the piriformis muscle and leaves the pelvic cavity through the greater sciatic foramen inferior to piriformis. Additionally, a number of small nerves that branch from the sacral plexus remain within the pelvic cavity, for example nerves that  supply levator ani and coccygeus muscles.Variant anatomyBifid piriformis muscles have been noted previously on cadaveric examination. 
__label__Musculoskeletal The nerve to quadratus femoris and inferior gemellus is formed from the anterior (ventral) divisions of the L4, L5 and S1 nerve roots of the sacral plexus. The nerve supplies the quadratus femoris and inferior gemellus muscles as well as providing an articular branch to the hip joint.   On this page:  Article: Gross anatomy Relations Variant anatomy Related articles References   Images:Cases and figures  Gross anatomyOriginThe nerve to quadratus femoris arises from the anterior divisions of the sacral plexus. It is formed from the L4-S1 nerve roots and exits the pelvis via the greater sciatic foramen inferior to the piriformis muscle and deep to the sciatic nerve. The nerve to quadratus femoris, unlike other nerves in the gluteal regions, lies anterior to the plane of the deep muscles of the gluteal region.CourseIt descends along the ischium and passes posterior to the hip joint, to which it sends an articular sensory branch. In this position the nerve lies deep to the tendon of the obturator internus muscle and gemelli which thus separate it from the overlying sciatic nerve.BranchesThe nerve continues downwards to pierce the deep (anterior) surface of the quadratus femoris muscle. The nerve also supplies the inferior gemellus muscle.RelationsThe nerve to quadratus femoris is separated from the sciatic nerve by the obturator internus and gemelli muscles.Variant anatomyIt has been noted in cadaveric studies that the nerve to quadratus femoris and obturator internus frequently arises from a common root and communication between these two nerves has been regularly observed. The inferior gemellus muscle has been recorded to occasionally receive additional innervation by branches of the nerve to obturator internus.

__label__Central __label__Nervous __label__System __label__Head __label__& __label__Neck Nervus intermedius neuralgia, or geniculate neuralgia, corresponds to a clinical manifestation of sudden paroxysms of excruciating otalgia which usually lasts a few seconds to a few minutes, involving the nervus intermedius (intermediate nerve of Wrisberg). On this page:  Article: Epidemiology Clinical presentation Pathology Radiographic features Treatment and prognosis History and etymology References   EpidemiologyNervus intermedius neuralgia typically occurs in middle-aged women 1. Although the exact incidence is unknown, it is considered far less common than trigeminal neuralgia 1.Clinical presentationThe clinical diagnostic criteria for nervus intermedius neuralgia are defined by the International Classification of Headache Disorders 3rd edition (ICHD-3) as 2: at least three attacks of unilateral pain  the pain is located in the auditory canal, sometimes radiating to the parieto-occipital region the pain has at least three of the following four characteristics recurring in paroxysmal attacks lasting from a few seconds to minutes severe intensity shooting, stabbing or sharp in quality precipitated by stimulation of a trigger in the posterior wall of the auditory canal and/or periauricular region   no clinically evident neurological deficit not better accounted for by another ICHD-3 diagnosis The ICHD-3 further comments that disorders of lacrimation, salivation and/or taste sometimes accompany the pain of nervus intermedius neuralgia, and that the pain may result in secondary psychological effects and impairment to quality of life 2.PathologyIt is not certain what exactly causes nervus intermedius neuralgia 3. However, the leading hypothesis considers that the condition is caused by irritation of the nervus intermedius, most likely via compression from a blood vessel, similar to trigeminal neuralgia, glossopharyngeal neuralgia, and vagoglossopharyngeal neuralgia 4,5. This theory is supported by the observation that many patients report benefits after vascular decompression 4,5,8.However, given that there are a number of other cranial nerves with afferents in the ear, it remains unclear whether all cases are due to irritation of nervus intermedius, or are actually due to irritation of other nearby cranial nerve afferents 2,3. Indeed, many case reports describe decompressing multiple cranial nerves in order to attain symptom relief 3.Additionally, there are other etiologies of this clinical syndrome: multiple sclerosis mass lesion in the cerebellopontine angle  Ramsay Hunt syndrome, known as 'nervus intermedius neuropathy attributed to Herpes zoster' in the ICHD-3 a possible familial syndrome that has an autosomal dominant or X-linked dominant pattern of inheritance 6  Radiographic featuresThe main role of imaging is to identify potential causes.CTCT is unable to visualize the nervus intermedius, and may only detect an obvious mass lesion 7.MRI The nervus intermedius is only visible on 3T MRI, especially on heavily T2 weighted thin section images 7. Contrast should be administered to assess for abnormal enhancement of the nerve or surrounding structures 4. Furthermore, MRA is required to assess for a compressing ectatic vascular loop, most commonly on the root entry zone of the nervus intermedius-vestibulocochlear nerve complex 4.Additionally, in one study, functional MRI was used to demonstrate that stimulation of the facial nerve in a patient with nervus intermedius neuralgia reproduced the otalgic symptoms and resulted in ipsilateral brainstem activation corresponding to the afferent distribution of the nervus intermedius 4. It is unclear if this technique has much potential for routine clinical utility.Treatment and prognosisManagement can involve pharmacotherapy (e.g. carbamazepine) and/or neurosurgical intervention (either microvascular decompression or excision of the nervus intermedius and geniculate ganglion) 3,4,8,9. In multiple case reports and case series, ‘excellent’ outcomes have been reported after neurosurgical intervention 8,9.History and etymologyAlthough the original description of nervus intermedius neuralgia is often attributed to James Ramsay Hunt (1872–1937), an American neurologist, who described a series of patients with Herpes zoster in 1937 10, the first description was actually by American physicians L. Pierce Clark and Alfred S. Taylor in 1909 11.
__label__Head __label__& __label__Neck The nervus spinous (plural: nervi spinosi), also known as the meningeal branch of the mandibular nerve, is a branch of the mandibular division of the trigeminal nerve which innervates the dura of the middle cranial fossa.Gross anatomyThe nervus spinosus divides off the mandibular division just below the foramen ovale and just before it branches into anterior and posterior divisions. It then ascends to re-enter the head through foramen spinosum or occasionally the foramen ovale. It supplies sensation to the cartilaginous part of the Eustachian tube, the trigeminal ganglion and the posterior half of the dura of the middle cranial fossa. The anterior half is supplied by the middle meningeal nerve from the maxillary division of the trigeminal nerve.The nerve continues to course between the squamous and petrous parts of the temporal bone, entering and supplying the mastoid antrum and the mastoid air cells.
__label__Central __label__Nervous __label__System The nervus terminalis, also referred to as cranial nerve zero, cranial nerve XIII, zero nerve, nerve N or NT, is a previously unnumbered cranial nerve, most rostral of all cranial nerves.Gross anatomyIt is a bilateral bundle of nerve fibers, which runs in the subarachnoid space from the medial olfactory stria on the inferior surface of the frontal lobe, to and through the cribriform plate, to the nasal septum. It runs medially to the olfactory nerve, over the surface of the gyrus rectus.    The terminal nerve originates from the neural crest, distinct and separate from the olfactory nerve (which originates in the nasal placode).FunctionWhilst not mentioned in recent editions of anatomy textbooks by Last or Gray, the nervus terminalis carries a number of key functions: in embryogenesis it acts as a migration route for LHRH cells and as such is probably implicated in pathogenesis of Kallman syndrome.In adults, based on animal studies, the nerve may be involved in reproductive behavior consisting of modulatory neurons. Radiographic featuresHigh-resolution modern MRI scanners that achieve voxel size of 0.6-0.7 mm should be able to adequately display the nerve and assess for its lesions. Cohort serial studies demonstrating this are pending.

__label__Central __label__Nervous __label__System The neural plate is an important developmental structure that forms the foundation of the nervous system 1,2. Formation of the neural plate occurs during the embryological process of neurulation which helps initiate the development of the nervous system 1,3.The neural plate develops at approximately day 19 after fertilization 2. The neural plate is a thickened portion of ectoderm along the midline of the embryo 4. During neurulation, the folds of the neural plate fuse to form the neural tube 1,2.Ultimately, the neural plate is an embryonic structure that forms the primitive brain at the cranial end and the spinal cord at the caudal end 1,4.Related pathologyFailure of neural tube closure in early pregnancy can result in neural tube defects, one of the commonest and most severe malformations of the fetus and newborn 1,2.
__label__Central __label__Nervous __label__System The neural tube comprises of a bundle of nerve sheaths and is the embryonic structure that ultimately forms the primitive brain at the cranial end and the spinal cord at the caudal end 1,2.The neural tube is formed during an embryological process called neurulation, a folding process where the neural plate transforms into the neural tube 1. The center of the tube is the neural canal 2.

__label__Paediatrics __label__Haematology __label__Central __label__Nervous __label__System Neuroacanthocytosis syndromes (NAS), previously known collectively as Levine-Critchley syndrome, are characterized by basal ganglia degeneration, acanthocytosis, and normal serum lipoprotein.There are four core NAS:  chorea-acanthocytosis (ChAc)  McLeod syndrome (MLS)  Huntington disease-like 2 (HDL2)  pantothenate kinase-associated neurodegeneration (PKAN)  On this page:  Article: Epidemiology Clinical presentation Pathology Radiographic Features Treatment and prognosis History and etymology References   EpidemiologyNAS are incredibly rare, with an estimated prevalence of 1-5:1000000 3,4.Clinical presentationThe presentation within and between each NAS is heterogeneous. Generally, patients present with movement disorder (commonly chorea and dystonia), cognitive decline and psychiatric disturbance 4,12. Acanthocytosis, red blood cells defined by the presence of multiple thorny projections, is most often seen in ChAc and MLS, and less frequently in HDL2 and PKAN. The presence of acanthocytes is not necessary for diagnosis 12. Elevated creatinine kinase is often found in ChAc and MLS.Unique features of chorea-acanthocytosisOf note, the finding of 'feeding dystonia' is pathognomonic of ChAc. Upon food touching the tongue, the tongue protrudes and forces the bolus out 5. In addition, the presence of 'rubber-man appearance', truncal instability and loss of axial tone with sudden spasms of flexion and extension, is highly suggestive of ChAc 12.PathologyEtiologyChorea-acanthocytosisChAc is caused by mutations in the gene encoding chorein, vacuolar protein sorting 13 homolog A (VPS13A) 5. The function of chorein is unclear, but has been shown to be of importance in exocytosis and cytoskeleton structure 6,7. McLeod syndromeThe McLeod blood group disorder arises from X-linked mutations in the XK gene at the Xp21.1 locus. The XK locus controls the expression of the ubiquitously expressed XK protein, which is predominantly found in nervous tissue, the myocardium and the erythrocytes cell surface 8. XK forms a disulphide bond with erythrocyte surface Kell antigens, forming a complex. XK and Kell expression is thereby correlated, and so reduced XK causes a reciprocal reduction in Kell. Most carriers of the McLeod blood group will develop the central nervous system features of MLS in later life. Of note, due to myocardial XK protein expression, cardiomyopathy often occurs in MLS. Upon laboratory testing, diminished Kell antigen expression should be seen on the red cell surface of MLS patients 9.Huntington disease-like 2Trinucleotide repeat expansions of junctophilin 3 (JPH3) are found in HDL2, which are thought to cause the formation of intracellular aggregates and subsequent cell death 4,10. Pantothenate kinase-associated neurodegenerationPKAN results from mutations in the pantothenate kinase 2 gene (PANK2) at the 20p13 locus. PANK2 encodes an enzyme, pantothenate kinase 2, which indirectly regulates mitochondria energy production via coenzyme A synthesis 4,11.SummaryThe genes identified in each subgroup and not clearly linked to a common pathway. However, there is a theme of membrane processing failure 12. It is worth noting that acanthocytes are present in a proportion of individuals affected by neurological dysfunction in other contexts. Specifically, inherited disorders of lipoprotein metabolism and in systemic diseases, such as severe malnutrition, cancer and liver cirrhosis 4. These are distinct from the core NAS.Radiographic FeaturesMRI T2/FLAIR:  generally: atrophy and gliosis of the basal ganglia are typical, and so these deep brain structures may appear reduced in size regions of the basal ganglia may be hyperintense, indicating gliosis   specifically: the head of the caudate is most often affected in ChAc, with the putamen, globus pallidus and substantia nigra affected to a lesser extent 12  bilateral atrophy of the caudate and putamen is again observed in MLS and HDL2 12  PKAN is characterized by an eye of the tiger iron deposition pattern - a round hyperintensity in the anteromedial globus pallidus 13     Treatment and prognosisThere are no curative therapies for NAS, with clinical management focusing on symptom control and quality of life 12. History and etymologyAcanthos is the Greek word for "thorn", from which the name of the red blood cell abnormality in NAS, acanthocytosis, is derived. The first case reports of adult acanthocytosis associated with neurological dysfunction, by MacDonald Critchley and Irvine Levine, date to the late 1960s 1-3. Interesting, NAS was originally known as Levine-Critchley syndrome, however, modern techniques could not confirm the originally identified families had NAS, as they were lost to follow-up, thus the eponymous term has been abandoned 4.

Occasionally, they may be identified antenatally or immediately at birth (see congenital neuroblastoma) 2.Clinical presentationTypically with pain or a palpable mass and abdominal distension, although numerous other presentations may be encountered due to local mass effect.Other accompanying syndromes include:  Hutchinson syndrome: skeletal metastases may present with skeletal pain or limping and irritability or proptosis with periorbital and cranial bumps 2,7   Pepper syndrome: hepatomegaly due to extensive liver metastasis  blueberry muffin syndrome: multiple cutaneous lesions  opsomyoclonus 5: rapid, involuntary conjugate fast eye movements proptosis and periorbital ecchymoses ("raccoon eyes"): orbital metastases  PathologyThe tumors arise from the primitive neuroectodermal cells or neural crest cells (adrenal medulla precursor). The histology is similar to small round blue cell tumors 3. The majority of them demonstrate chromosome 1p deletion and N-myc amplification.Macroscopically, they tend to be large grey-tan colored soft lesions, with or without fibrous pseudocapsule; hence, some are well defined, and some are infiltrative. Areas of necrosis, hemorrhage, and particularly calcification, are very common.Microscopically, they form Homer Wright rosettes 3. Most of them secrete catecholamines: vanillylmandelic acid (VMA) and homovanillic acid (HVA) 2.LocationNeuroblastomas arise from the sympathetic nervous system 2,3:Intra-abdominal disease (two-thirds of cases) is more prevalent than intrathoracic disease.

Pressure on adjacent bones may cause remodelling of ribs, vertebral bodies or pedicle thinning. Up to 30% may have evidence of calcification on the plain film.Skeletal metastases are usually ill-defined and lucent, with periosteal reaction or metaphyseal lucency. Sclerotic metastases are uncommon 2.UltrasoundNeuroblastoma on ultrasound demonstrates a heterogeneous mass with internal vascularity. Often there are areas of necrosis that appear as regions of low echogenicity. Calcification may or may not be evident on ultrasound 2.CTOn CT, the tumor typically is heterogeneous with calcifications seen in 80-90% of cases 2. Areas of necrosis are of low attenuation.The tumor morphology is often helpful, with the mass seen insinuating itself beneath the aorta and lifting it off the vertebral column. It tends to encase vessels and may lead to compression. Adjacent organs are usually displaced, although in more aggressive tumors direct invasion of the psoas muscle or kidney can be seen. The latter can make distinguishing neuroblastoma from Wilms tumor difficult (see neuroblastoma vs. Wilms tumor).Lymph node enlargement is often present.MRIMRI is superior to all other modalities in assessing the organ of origin, intracranial or intraspinal disease and bone marrow disease 2.

__label__Oncology __label__Paediatrics Image-defined risk factors are imaging features seen at the time of neuroblastoma diagnosis that confer a poorer prognosis. The International Neuroblastoma Risk Group (INRG) suggested an update (2009) to the neuroblastoma staging with a list of features that, if present, upstages a patient with local disease from L1 to L2.Crossing/extending from one compartment to another (e,g. chest to neck, abdomen to chest, abdomen to pelvis) through sciatic notch/foramen  Encasing vessels carotid artery vertebral artery internal jugular vein subclavian artery/vein aorta superior or inferior vena cava celiac artery superior mesenteric artery (including branches at the mesenteric root) iliac artery or vein Compressing trachea primary bronchi Encasing nervesbrachial plexus rootsInvading and infiltrating to skull base into spinal canal - defined as; >1/3 of canal involved on an axial section perimedullary leptomeningeal space not visible signal change in the adjacent spinal cord   costovertebral junction from T9-T12 porta hepatis,  hepatoduodenal ligament or liver renal pedicle or kidney pericardium duodenopancreatic block mesentery Practical points encasement: in contact with >50% (artery or vein) or completely occluding a vein (n.b. <50% is "contact"; incomplete occlusion of a vein is "flattening") compression: any cross-sectional narrowing of an airway synchronous and metachronous tumors should be staged separately See alsoneuroblastoma
__label__Paediatrics __label__Urogenital __label__Oncology There are two methods of neuroblastoma staging, one that is based on post-operative patients (INSS) and one developed for pre-treatment patients (INRGSS).StagingInternational Neuroblastoma Staging System (INSS)This staging system is for post-operative patients and mainly for prognosis 1:  stage 1 localized tumor with complete gross excision with or without microscopic residual disease contralateral and representative ipsilateral regional lymph nodes negative for disease (nodes attached to and removed with primary tumor may be positive)    stage 2a localized tumor with incomplete gross excision ipsilateral and contralateral nodes negative for tumor    stage 2b localized tumor with complete or incomplete resection positive ipsilateral (non-adherent) nodes contralateral nodes negative for tumor    stage 3 unresectable lateral tumor that crosses the midline or localized tumor with contralateral regional lymph node involvement midline tumor with bilateral extension by infiltration or by lymph node involvement    stage 4S ("special") <1 year of age localized tumor (stage 1, 2A or 2B) distant metastases confined to skin, liver and/or bone marrow    stage 4distant metastases not fulfilling stage 4S  In the majority of cases (60-80%), patients present with stage 3 or 4 tumors 2.International Neuroblastoma Risk Group Staging System (INRGSS)The INRG was developed after INSS to formulate staging for pre-operative neuroblastoma 5,6:  stage L1localized tumors confined to one body cavity and not involving imaged-defined risk factors (IDRFs)   stage L2locoregional tumors involving one or more IDRFs   stage M distant (remote) metastases (i.e. excludes metastases to local lymph node groups) excludes stage MS    stage MSmetastases in patients <18 months (some centers <12 months) confined to skin, liver and/or bone marrow   More than 20 imaged-defined risk factors (IDRF) have been extensively defined by the INRG 5,6, and these are outside the scope of this article.

__label__Central __label__Nervous __label__System Neurobrucellosis refers to central nervous system involvement by brucellosis and occurs secondary to ingestion or contact with gram-negative, facultative intracellular coccobacilli of the Brucella species. Up to 10% of infections are complicated by neurological involvement 1. The remainder of this article is a discussion of CNS brucellosis. For a general discussion on systemic infection, please refer to the article on brucellosis. On this page:  Article: Epidemiology Clinical presentation Pathology Radiographic features Differential diagnosis Related articles References   EpidemiologyBrucella is found worldwide. High-risk areas include countries surrounding the Mediterranean Sea, Eastern Europe, Mexico, South and Central America, Africa, Asia, the Caribbean and the Middle East 2. Clinical presentationOnset is insidious; undulant, low-grade fever, headache, fatigue and malaise may precede any neurological findings by a number of months. A study of 128 patients with brucellosis found that central nervous symptom involvement is more likely if the following signs and symptoms are present 3: blurred vision sensorineural hearing loss disorientation recent behavioral change agitation muscle weakness neck stiffness deep tendon reflex change paresthesia diplopia ataxia pseudotumor cerebri facial paralysis Brucella may be isolated from blood cultures and/or cerebrospinous fluid (CSF). Additional CSF abnormalities include the presence of anti-Brucella antibodies, pleocytosis, high protein and low glucose levels 4.PathologyTransmission occurs secondary to direct contact with infected animals or the consumption of unpasteurised dairy products. In addition to the four main species causing brucellosis, ​B. ceti and B. pinnipediae have more recently been isolated in the context of neurobrucellosis 2. Radiographic featuresIn just under half of brucellosis cases with neurological findings, imaging of the CNS is unremarkable 5,6. Abnormal neuroimaging may involve the meninges, cranial nerves, white and grey matter, vasculature, and spinal nerve roots 5,6. CTDiffuse white matter changes, meningeal enhancement, lacunae and hemorrhages within the basal ganglia, hydrocephalus and cerebral edema may be demonstrated.MRI  T1: arachnoiditis  T2/FLAIR: ​arachnoiditis; diffuse, hyperintense lesions affecting the white matter, with an appearance of focal demyelination  T1/T2 C+ (Gd): brain abscess or granuloma with ring enhancement; leptomeningeal, basal meningeal, perivascular and/or spinal root enhancement Differential diagnosisThe heterogenous presentation and imaging findings of neurobrucellosis warrant a thorough history and risk-stratification. Clarification of recent travel and exposure to unpasteurised dairy is important, remembering that both acute and chronic presentations are possible.Differentials are therefore numerous, but include:  demyelinating disorders, such as  multiple sclerosis - note the possibility of blurred vision, weakness, ataxia, malaise, fatigue and persistent low-grade fever with evidence of demyelination on MRI as an easy misdiagnosis  acute disseminated encephalomyeltitis (ADEM) - fever, headache, cranial nerve palsies and behavioral change with imaging difficult to distinguish from multiple sclerosis again allowing for misdiagnosis inherited vasculopathies inflammatory vasculitides   equine viral encephalomyelitis, secondary to infection with epidemic Venezuelan equine encephalomyelitis western equine encephalomyelitis eastern equine encephalomyelitis Japanese encephalitis West Nile virus   tuberculosis Murray Valley encephalitis histoplasmosis cryptococcal infection, which may present as central nervous system cryptococcosis cryptococcoma   blastomycosis neurosarcoidosis 
__label__Central __label__Nervous __label__System Neurocandidiasis results from disseminated infection of the central nervous system by the fungus Candida albicans, usually manifesting as cerebral micro-abscesses and meningitis. On this page:  Article: Epidemiology Clinical presentation Pathology Radiographic features Treatment and prognosis Differential diagnosis Related articles References   EpidemiologyCNS disease is thought to occur in up to 52% of patients with disseminated candidiasis, but predominates in immunocompromised individuals 1,2.Risk factorsRisk factors include 1,2: AIDS prolonged high-dose corticosteroid use neutropenia, especially in the setting of hematological malignancies  graft-vs-host disease after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation neonates with recent neurosurgery patients with CNS shunts and other devices Clinical presentationPatients with neurocandidiasis have a varied presentation, but most commonly exhibit symptoms akin to an acute or chronic bacterial meningitis, however these symptoms may be subtle or absent in neonates or severely neutropenic patients 1,2. Furthermore, in patients with multiple cerebral micro-abscesses, a diffuse encephalopathy may be the predominant clinical presentation, however this is also often subtle 1.PathologyNeurocandidiasis most commonly results from disseminated haematogenous infection of Candida albicans, but can rarely also be due to other Candida spp. such as Candida parapsilosis, Candida tropicalis, and Candida glabrate 3. In addition to haematogenous spread to the CNS, Candida may also be introduced to the CNS during craniotomy or through the presence of a CNS shunt 3.Once in the CNS, and due to their small size, Candida has a predilection for the microcirculation, classically resulting in multiple cerebral micro-abscesses and leptomeningitis 4. However, Candida can also uncommonly cause the development of mycotic aneurysms resulting in intracerebral hemorrhage or subarachnoid hemorrhage, thrombosis in small perforating arterioles resulting in ischemic stroke, cerebral macro-abscesses, and cerebral vasculitis 1,2.Radiographic featuresThe disease can have a variety of radiographic features, but the main two findings are 1,2: multiple micro-abscesses leptomeningitis CTCT findings can often be subtle and non-specific 1. The most common reported feature is secondary communicating hydrocephalus reflective of leptomeningitis, however this is still an uncommon finding seen in only 20% of cases 1,2. Micro-abscesses are very rarely appreciated on CT 1.MRIMicro-abscessesMicro-abscesses are the hallmark radiographic feature of neurocandidiasis 1,2. They are less than 3 mm in size, multiple, and most commonly located at the gray-white matter junction, basal ganglia, and/or cerebellum 1,5-9. These micro-abscesses have MR signal characteristics that are identical to other brain abscesses, those being classic ring-enhancing lesions with striking high signal intensity on DWI 1,5-9. Small hemorrhagic components are also commonly observed, which may demonstrate low signal intensity on T2-weighted images and may be better appreciated on GRE or SWI images 1,2,5.LeptomeningitisIn addition to secondary communicating hydrocephalus, MRI may reveal non-specific leptomeningeal enhancement on post-gadolinium images 1. However, this enhancement does not occur in any specific distribution making it therefore indistinguishable from bacterial leptomeningitis, and is also uncommonly reported 1.Other featuresAs aforementioned, rarely neurocandidiasis can present with other clinico-radiological features:  intracerebral hemorrhage or subarachnoid hemorrhage with or without  identifiable mycotic aneurysms 1,2   ischemic stroke, especially in the territories of perforating arteries such as the basal ganglia 1,2   cerebral macro-abscesses, usually located in the parieto-occipital region 1,2   cerebral vasculitis 2  Treatment and prognosisNeurocandidiasis is treated with intravenous antifungal agents such as liposomal amphotericin B and flucytosine 1. Neurosurgical opinion and intervention may also be sought if CNS shunt infection is suspected 1. Mortality of neurocandidiasis is reported to be up to 30% 9.Differential diagnosisGeneral imaging differential considerations include: other types of CNS infection CNS toxoplasmosis CNS aspergillosis CNS tuberculosis pyogenic abscesses    cerebral metastases

__label__Central __label__Nervous __label__System Neurocutaneous melanosis or neurocutaneous melanomatosis, is a rare sporadic phakomatosis characterized by multiple congenital cutaneous nevi and meningeal melanocytosis / meningeal melanomatosis.  On this page:  Article: Epidemiology Clinical presentation Pathology Radiographic features Treatment and prognosis Related articles References   Images:Cases and figures  EpidemiologyNeurocutaneous melanosis tends to be diagnosed in the first few years of life with no gender predilection reported 5,7. The condition is most frequently reported in Caucasians 7. Clinical presentationThe disease is characterized by multiple melanotic nevi in the skin. Approximately two-thirds of patients have a giant nevus covering the back, known as a "bathing trunk" congenital nevus 7.The diagnosis is often made when the child presents with hydrocephalus due to meningeal melanocytosis / meningeal melanomatosis (a.k.a. diffuse melanosis) 5. Occasionally a delayed presentation occurs towards the end of the second decade, in which case neuropsychiatric presentation is more common 7.Diagnostic features have been proposed 2: unduly large or unusually numerous pigmented nevi in association with leptomeningeal melanosis or melanoma no evidence of malignant change in any of the cutaneous lesions no evidence of malignant melanoma in any organ apart from the meninges PathologyIt is believed that neurocutaneous melanosis is the result of congenital dysplasia of melanoblasts (melanocyte precursors) which are of neural crest cell origin 1,4,7. These are located in the leptomeninges, optic globes, inner ear, sinonasal cavity, and skin 1,4. Associations  Sturge-Weber syndrome 7   Dandy-Walker malformation 6,7  Radiographic featuresFor leptomeningeal imaging features, please refer to meningeal melanocytosis.In addition to or instead of leptomeningeal involvement, parenchymal changes are seen in some individuals characterized by T1 signal hyperintensity involving the mesial temporal lobes (particularly the amygdala), ventral pons and medulla, cerebellum, and inferior frontal lobes 6,7. It is believed this is due to melanocytes tracking along perivascular spaces 7. Treatment and prognosisPrognosis in symptomatic cases is extremely poor, even in the absence of malignant transformations, particularly when associated with a Dandy-Walker malformation 7. Hydrocephalus is the most common complication. Involvement of the cord also may result in myelopathy, syringomyelia, and arachnoiditis. Malignant transformation of cutaneous nevi is variably reported from 2-13% 4. Malignant transformation of CNS melanosis occurs very frequently, in up to 50% 5.
__label__Central __label__Nervous __label__System Neurocysticercosis is caused by the CNS infection with the pork tapeworm Taenia solium, which is endemic in most low-income countries where pigs are raised. This form of cysticercosis is a relevant cause of seizures in endemic areas. On this page:  Article: Epidemiology Clinical presentation Pathology Radiographic features Treatment and prognosis Differential diagnosis Related articles References   Images: Cases and figures Imaging differential diagnosis   EpidemiologyThe disease is endemic in Central and South America, Asia and Africa. The perpetuation of this parasitic disease is related to poor sanitation and hygiene.There is no gender or race predilection and most symptomatic patients are aged 15-40 years 4. Clinical presentationThere is a variable time interval between the point of infection and the onset of symptoms (ranging from 1-30 years).Clinical presentation includes 1: seizures: most common symptom and the most common cause of seizures in young adults in endemic areas 2  headaches hydrocephalus altered mental status neurological deficits   Bruns syndrome: caused by cysticerci cysts of the third and fourth ventricle 4  CSF serology may be helpful with the initial diagnosis especially in cases of intraventricular/subarachnoid infection 2.PathologyInfection, which leads to extra-intestinal disease (including neurocysticercosis), usually occurs as a result of eating food or drinking water contaminated by human feces containing T. solium eggs. This is distinct from the 'normal' life cycle in which the undercooked pork is eaten and the larval cysts contained within, mature into adult intestinal tapeworm 3.Extra-intestinal infection undergoes specific clinical and imaging changes at it progresses through four stages of infection 1.StagesThere are four main stages (also known as Escobar's pathological stages):  vesicular: viable parasite with intact membrane and therefore no host reaction.   colloidal vesicular: parasite dies within 4-5 years 1 untreated, or earlier with treatment and the cyst fluid becomes turbid. As the membrane becomes leaky edema surrounds the cyst. This is the most symptomatic stage.  granular nodular: edema decreases as the cyst retract further; enhancement persists.  nodular calcified: end-stage quiescent calcified cyst remnant; no edema. LocationInfection can be both intra- and extra-axial. Commonest locations are 3-5: subarachnoid space over the cerebral hemispheres: can be very large  parenchyma: most common location, frequently seen near the grey matter-white matter junction 4  basal cisternsmaybe "grape-like" (racemose): most lack an identifiable scolex  ventricles  usually solitary cyst 4th ventricle: most frequent location   spinal forms: associated with concomitant intracranial involvement 4  Typically the parenchymal cysts are small (1 cm) whereas the subarachnoid cysts can be much bigger (up to 9 cm): differential, therefore, being an arachnoid cyst.Radiographic featuresImaging findings depend on the location and stage of infection. LocationSubarachnoid/intraventricularWhen in the subarachnoid space/interventricular, the cysts typically do not have a visible scolex. In the basal cisterns, they can be grape-like (racemose). The cysts are typically 1-2 cm in diameter 2. Usually, the cysts are similar in signal intensity to CSF, although occasionally cyst fluid may somewhat differ 2.In the ventricles, there is often (79%) 2 associated ventriculitis often leading to aqueductal stenosis and hydrocephalus 2.ParenchymalParenchymal cysts usually involve the grey-white matter junction 2.StageVesicular cyst with dot sign CSF density/intensity hyperintense scolex on T1 can sometimes be seen no enhancement is typical, although very faint enhancement of the wall and enhancement of the scolex may be seen Colloidal vesicular cyst fluid becomes turbid CT: hyperattenuating to CSF MRI T1: hyperintense to CSF 2    surrounding edema cyst and the wall become thickened and brightly enhances scolex can often still be seen as an eccentric focus of enhancement Granular nodular edema decreases cyst retracts enhancement persists but is less marked 1  Nodular calcified end-stage quiescent calcified cyst remnant no edema no enhancement on CT signal drop out on T2 and T2* sequences some intrinsic high T1 signal may be present long term enhancement may be evident on MRI and may predict ongoing seizures 1  Treatment and prognosisThe treatment options available to patients with neurocysticercosis include symptomatic therapy (e.g. anti-epileptics) and anthelmintic therapy (e.g. albendazole and praziquantel, the two antiparasitics most commonly used 4), usually accompanied by corticosteroids. Surgery (e.g. VP shunt placement or decompression) is only rarely indicated. Differential diagnosisGeneral imaging differential considerations include: cerebral metastasis pyogenic cerebral abscess  tuberculoma amoebic encephalitis perivascular spaces other parasitic/fungal infection(s)

__label__Central __label__Nervous __label__System Neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation (NBIA), is a heterogeneous group of rare genetic disorders characterized by accumulation of iron in the basal ganglia, which result in variable neurological disorders including extrapyramidal symptoms, neuropsychiatric and visual.Numerous genes (at least 10) have been identified, resulting in a variety of specific diseases 3:  pantothenate kinase-associated neurodegeneration (PKAN) most common form accounting for 35-50% of NBIA previously known as Hallervorden-Spatz syndrome     PLA2G6-associated neurodegeneration (PLAN)accounts for ~20% of NBIA   mitochondrial membrane protein-associated neurodegeneration (MPAN)accounts for ~6-10% of NIBA   beta-propeller protein-associated neurodegeneration (BPAN)accounts of 1-2% of NIBA  infantile neuroaxonal dystrophy (INAD) / atypical neuroaxonal dystrophy (NAD) aceruloplasminaemia COASY protein-associated neurodegeneration (COPAN) fatty acid hydroxylase-associated neurodegeneration (FAHN) Kufor-Rakeb syndrome neuroferritinopathy Woodhouse-Sakati syndrome  On this page:  Article: Epidemiology Clinical presentation Radiographic features Treatment and prognosis  References   Images:Cases and figures  EpidemiologyNo single demographic is affected, and epidemiology varied depending on the specific condition, ranging from infancy to old age 3. Clinical presentationPatients with NBIA suffer from a variety of neurological symptoms and signs including 3:  extrapyramidal symptomsdystonia, muscular rigidity, spasms, parkinsonism  neuropsychiatric optic atrophy retinal degeneration Radiographic featuresRadiographic features will vary among the various entities, but can broadly be thought of as 3: basal ganglia signal abnormalities cerebellar and cerebral atrophy Treatment and prognosis Although therapies will vary, dystonia is being treated with deep brain stimulation as well as oral or intrathecal baclofen 3. Renewed interest in iron chelation is now present with the development of deferiprone 3. 
__label__Central __label__Nervous __label__System A neurodegenerative disease is a blanket term encompassing a wide variety of disorders, typically slowly progressive, with variable gradual neurologic dysfunction. Over the years numerous classifications schemas have been described, each adding a layer of confusion for students. The main distinction to be aware of is classifications according to clinical presentation and those relying on underlying pathological processes. As expected, earlier descriptions were primarily of the former, whereas as more and more neurodegenerative disease are understood at a biochemical level, classifications have shifted towards focusing on these changes. As such a useful approach is to divide them according to underlying pathological process, although even so there is much overlap and confusion with many clinical patterns being caused by different pathological process and each pathology possibly manifesting in a number of clinical patterns 1,5. What is worse is that as definitive diagnosis currently necessitates histological diagnosis of brain tissue (either antemortem biopsy or postmortem assessment) the actual diagnosis in most cases is never established, further polluting the published data. Dividing neurodegenerative disease by the main pathological process involved results in the classification below (under "Related Radiopaedia Articles"). It should be noted that any such classification is, by the very nature of the heterogeneity of the included conditions, not always felt to be complete. For the purpose of this section, diseases that are primarily metabolic in origin are excluded. See primary metabolic encephalopathies.
__label__Central __label__Nervous __label__System Imaging of the brain in patients with suspected neurodegenerative conditions is common and challenging, as in patients with subtle and equivocal signs and symptoms, the imaging findings are also often subtle and equivocal. In many instances, by the time imaging findings are clear cut, then the patient has declared themselves clinically, and the diagnosis is already established or at least strongly suggested. As such the true role of imaging is often to push clinicians towards or away from a particular diagnosis rather than making a firm unwavering diagnosis; in other words, it is an exercise in applied Bayesian thinking. It should also be noted that although MRI is the focus of this article many of the structural and volumetric changes that are sought can be reasonably well seen on CT imaging if it is performed volumetrically and time is taken to look for them.  On this page:  Article: Main conditions Importance of the clinical history Protocol Scoring systems and measurements  Signs Systematic approach Putting it all together Related articles References   Main conditionsAlthough there are a great many conditions which fall under the neurodegenerative umbrella, and even more which can result in cognitive impairment, the majority of patients with significant cognitive impairment will have one of a relatively small group, and familiarity with them is crucial. These include:  Alzheimer disease vascular dementia posterior cortical atrophy dementia with Lewy bodies frontotemporal lobar degeneration In addition there are a number of 'classic' albeit uncommon to rare conditions with specific imaging findings:  Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) multiple system atrophy (MSA)  Huntington disease Parkinson disease corticobasal degeneration CADASIL Unfortunately, not all these conditions have good imaging biomarkers and understanding this is crucial in not being unnecessarily certain of a particular diagnosis. A further group of conditions, beyond the scope of this article, are conditions which can present with neurodegenerative-like signs and symptoms, such as:  anterior cranial fossa meningioma  chronic subdural hematomas  normal pressure hydrocephalus Importance of the clinical historyA good clinical history is paramount if the importance of subtle findings is to be appreciated whilst not overemphasising non-specific features. Unfortunately, all too often requests contain only vague details such as "dementia?" or "cognitive impairment".Ideally, an MRI request should include two key components:  pertinent clinical information the working diagnosis and differential Clinical information patient demographicsage, gender, ethnicity, and perhaps occupation  main presenting complaint characterization of cognitive symptoms attentional problems memory problems (e.g. short term / long term / ante-grade / retrograde) language problems (e.g. receptive, expressive)  visual / constructional problems apraxia/acalculia personality change (e.g. disinhibition, aggression)    characterization of physical symptoms tremor rigidity hyperkinesis falls dysphagia incontinence eye signs   time courseonset, duration, progression  any relevant family historye.g. parent with Huntington disease   any risk factors for differential diagnosise.g. smoking, hypertension, diabetes, stroke  any toxic exposurese.g. medications, alcohol, illicit substances, radiation, environmental poisons  clearly stated differential diagnosis or study questione.g. ?caudate atrophy  Working diagnosis and differential It is unlikely that even a talented subspecialty neuroradiologist will be able to develop as good a working diagnosis and differential diagnosis based on the above information as a clinician who has examined the patient, spent time with them, and who has years of clinical experience to draw up. Therefore, the working diagnosis, the relevant differential diagnosis and some sense of how likely these diagnoses are is essential. That way, the MRI report can then push towards or away from a particular diagnosis rather. ProtocolThere are many variations on a 'neurodegenerative protocol' and much will depend upon local preferences and equipment. What is essential is that good quality three plane imaging (sagittal, coronal and axial) with T1, T2, FLAIR, DWI and T2* (e.g SWI) sequences.Some sequences are best for anatomy (e.g. T1) whereas others are better at pathology (e.g. FLAIR). Others still are useful for the detection specific of specific changes (e.g. SWI microhemorrhages). For a more detailed discussion, please refer to the separate article on neurodegenerative MRI protocol. Scoring systems and measurements Although in most instances individual scoring systems are not reported, they are useful to know even if only as guides on which features have been found useful and reliable. Some of the more common scoring systems include:   Fazekas scale for white matter lesions: the deep white matter component is used in assessing the amount of chronic small vessel ischemic change  posterior atrophy score of parietal atrophy (PA or PCA or Koedam score): useful in atypical (posterior cortical atrophy) or early-onset Alzheimer disease.   medial temporal lobe atrophy score (MTA score)  global cortical atrophy scale (GCA scale)  A number of measurements/ratios are also useful:   midbrain to pons area ratio (for PSP)  magnetic resonance parkinsonism index (MRPI) (for PSP) SignsIn addition to systematically going through each scan, it is worth specifically looking for some signs, which will ensure you do not miss a diagnosis which will in retrospect be obvious. Having said this, many of these signs are only useful (if at all) late in the course of the disease at which time the diagnosis is often already obvious clinically.Nonetheless, some of the better-known signs include:   hummingbird sign of PSP   Mickey Mouse sign of PSP   morning glory sign of PSP   hot cross bun sign of MSA-C  reversal of normal T2 signal of putamen vs globus pallidus of MSA-P  atrophic caudate heads of Huntington disease  mammillary high T2 signal of Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome   hockey stick sign or pulvinar sign of CJD  Systematic approachIt should be self-evident that no single approach is the 'correct one'. What is certain is that in assessing an MRI brain for neurodegenerative diseases, perhaps more so than for other indications, a careful systematic approach is needed. What that approach is does not matter so much, as long as all pertinent features are sought. What is presented here is the approach used by the author.1. T1 sagittalBegin by looking at the midline sagittal image and assess the following:  corpus callosum ​the anterior half of the body should be thicker, and certainly not thinner than the posterior half. If thinner a degree of frontal lobe atrophy should be immediately suspected. ​ upward bowing may suggest hydrocephalus, including normal pressure hydrocephalus   midbrain shape, size and midbrain to pons area ratio it is often easier to note abnormalities of the midbrain in the sagittal plane roughly the area of the midbrain should be about a quarter of the pons, and with a little practice this can be easily eyeballed don't overcall the hummingbird sign of PSP    pons shapethe pons should be plump and rounded and about 4 times as large as the midbrain. Be prepared to look for pontine atrophy if it looks small or flattened (e.g. multiple system atrophy)   general morphology of the rest of the brain: many congenital anomalies have midline changes Next, move slightly to the left and right of the midline to asses the following:medial surfaces of the frontal, parietal and occipital lobes all the sulci should be about the same size significant parietal sulcal widening with atrophy of the precuneus and posterior cingulate suggests Alzheimer disease  anterior-to-posterior gradient of sulcal size (bigger anteriorly) seen in frontotemporal lobar degeneration  mammillary bodiesshould be about the same size. Atrophic or asymmetrical mammillary bodies may imply hippocampal pathology or Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome   hippocampal volume: sagittal is a surprisingly good plane for the hippocampi provided you have thin enough imaging. You should see them to be plump grey matter signal intensity sausage-shaped structures with the choroidal fissure above them, which may contain small cysts or focal expansions containing choroid. The hippocampi slightly taper as you progress from anterior to posterior. Reversal of this tapering may be seen in FTLD. In contrast, general atrophy is seen Alzheimer disease.   Finally, move all the way to the lateral surfaces of the brain and examine the following: Sylvian fissure and cistern size are they out of keeping with the rest of the brain?  left to right asymmetry?   general sulcal and gyral size looking for regional atrophy Don't forget to look at everything else too. Sagittal T1 is often your largest field of view sequence and will be the only one to image the oral cavity, TMJ and upper cervical spine and cord. 2. Coronal sequencesCoronal sequences are essential in the assessment of the hippocampi and careful attention must be paid not only to their size but also the distribution of change. On these sequences assess:  hippocampal, choroidal fissure and temporal horn size (see medial temporal lobe atrophy score)don't forget to ask yourself whether the temporal horn is big or the hippocampus is small  symmetry left > right atrophy favors FTLD equal involvement favors Alzheimer disease   anterior to posterior gradientanterior atrophy > posterior atrophy favors FTLD  involvement of the temporal lobe generally favors FTLD atrophy largely restricted to the hippocampus and parahippocampal gyrus favors Alzheimer disease mammillary body size, signal and symmetry 3. Axial FLAIR & T2Start with the FLAIR axial sequences and examine:  gyral atrophy, particularly useful for the frontal lobes widening of the Sylvian fissures in FTLD typically left > right   normal pressure hydrocephalus in excess of gyral widening and expect to see crowding of the gyri at the vertex   hippocampal volume and signal posterior fossa morphology midbraindon't overcall Mickey Mouse sign or morning glory sign of PSP  ponspontine hot cross bun sign of MSA-C  medullaolivary atrophy of MSA-C  cerebellum  look for atrophy and high T2 signal of middle cerebellar peduncle sign (MSA-C, FXTAS etc...) atrophy of the vermis (e.g. in alcohol abuse and antiepilepsy medication)       Wernicke pattern high T2 signal (ventromedial thalamus, mammillary bodies, periaqueductal grey matter)  degree of white matter signal and pattern subcortical/deep white matter in chronic small vessel ischemia (common); consider multi-infarct dementia periventricular in demyelination (uncommon in this setting)    ventricular size: is it commensurate with sulcal widening? evidence of old cortical infarctsespecially of cognitively important areas 1: bilateral thalamic infarcts inferomedial temporal lobe (especially dominant side)  association areas (parietotemporal, temporo-occipital and angular gyrus)  borderzone (watershed) infarcts (superior frontal and parietal)    T2 axial imaging is often better for basal ganglia structures and posterior fossa. Assess for:  reversal of normal T2 signal of putamen vs globus pallidus of MSA-P  atrophic caudate heads of Huntington disease  size and flow void in aqueduct (usually prominent in NPH)  Don't forget that T2 sequences usually give you the best look at the intracranial arteries, so make sure you look for aneurysms or vascular malformations. 4. T2* sequencesSequences susceptible to blood products are particularly useful in assessing:microhemorrhages peripherally distributed in cerebral amyloid angiopathy which in turn is associated with Alzheimer disease centrally distributed (basal ganglia/pons/cerebellum) in chronic hypertensive encephalophathy   5. DWI DWI has a limited role in the assessment of a patient with a suspected neurodegenerative disease, but is crucial particularly for Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease: look for cortical, basal ganglia and thalamic restricted diffusion. Always look carefully for evidence of acute ischemia, although this is uncommonly seen in elective outpatient scans. Putting it all togetherHaving gone through the scan systematically hopefully a definite pattern conforming to one of the suspected pathologies has become evident. In such cases, your conclusion should state which entity is most likely, but do so in a way that explicitly acknowledges that this opinion takes into account clinical context.e.g. "In this age group and in the setting of visual symptoms and apraxias, bilateral relatively subtle parietal volume loss supports the clinical diagnosis of posterior cortical atrophy". This is particularly important if findings are subtle or contradictory or if adequate clinical information is absent. In the latter scenario, an attempt to obtain it should be made and the author of the request card gently chastised :)In either case, it is often important to not appear to be overly certain, as in most instances imaging features are not pathognomonic. Once a label has been applied, shrugging it off is very difficult and can lead to long delays in a correct diagnosis.It is better to state that findings are non-specific and not strongly indicative of any single entity and recommend repeat imaging in 12 months at which time both the clinical and imaging features may be more convincing than arguing strongly for a particular diagnosis on the basis of flimsy evidence. 
__label__Central __label__Nervous __label__System MRI protocol for neurodegenerative diseases assessment is a group of MRI sequences put together to best approach a wide variety of disorders, typically slowly progressive, with variable gradual neurologic dysfunction. Please, refer to neurodegenerative MRI brain (an approach) for a broad discussion on how to go through these exams.Note: This article is intended to outline some general principles of protocol design. The specifics will vary depending on MRI hardware and software, radiologist's and referrer's preference, institutional protocols, patient factors (e.g. allergy) and time constraints. SequencesAlthough, as is the case with all MRI protocols, there is no such thing as a universally agreed upon MRI protocol to image an individual with a suspected neurodegenerative condition, what is essential is that good quality three plane imaging (sagittal, coronal and axial) is obtained which includes T1, T2, FLAIR, DWI and T2* (SWI ideally) sequences.A fairly standard protocol may include:   T1​   sequence:  volumetric gradient-echo e.g. MPRAGE, preferably isometric e.g. 0.9 mm reformatted in three planes  purpose: anatomical, best for assessing regional volume loss and may be used for automated brain morphometry     T2  sequence: fast spin echo, whole-brain or limited to basal ganglia and posterior fossa (thins e.g. 3 mm)  purpose: signal intensity of basal ganglia, and posterior fossa structures (often less well seen on FLAIR due to flow artefact)    FLAIR  sequence: whole-brain axial or volumetric  purpose: white matter signal abnormalities such as small vessel ischemia resulting in multi-infarct dementia and abnormal sulcal signal in leptomeningeal processes (e.g. leptomeningeal carcinomatosis)    DWI/ADC (or isometric images from optional DTI acquisition)purpose: cortical or deep grey matter restricted diffusion in Creutzfeldt Jakob disease (CJD) and restriction in demyelination of infarction (e.g. cerebral vasculitis)    T2* (e.g. SWI)  sequence: SWI including phase and magnitude images  purpose: microhemorrhages (e.g. cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA), hypertensive encephalopathy).

__label__Chest __label__Paediatrics Neuroendocrine cell hyperplasia of infancy (NEHI) is a rare interstitial lung disease of childhood that typically presents in the first year of life. On this page:  Article: Terminology Epidemiology Clinical presentation Pathology Radiographic features Treatment and prognosis Differential diagnosis References   TerminologyNeuroendocrine cell hyperplasia of infancy was previously reported as persistent tachypnea of infancy until the disease was found to be associated with an increased number of neuroendocrine cells on histopathology of lung biopsies.EpidemiologyNEHI typically occurs in the first year of life. Its current prevalence and incidence are not known but may be underreported as it is commonly misdiagnosed with other types of lung diseases. Etiology is unknown, but genetic factors are likely involved.Clinical presentationInfants typically present in respiratory distress with tachypnea, chest wall retractions, hypoxia, crepitations on auscultation of the chest, and failure to thrive.PathologyThe gold standard for diagnosis of neuroendocrine cell hyperplasia of infancy is demonstrating an increase in neuroendocrine cells with an otherwise normal lung architecture on tissue diagnosis. Standard staining will demonstrate essentially normal lung histology but shows an increase in Bombesin-positive cells with specific staining (indicating increased neuroendocrine cells). Neuroendocrine cell prominence appears to be related with disease severity.Radiographic featuresReports from current research and case series suggests that neuroendocrine cell hyperplasia of infancy may have consistent radiographic features.Plain radiographsChest radiographs are non-specific but commonly show hyperinflation.CTThe most common features are ground glass opacification (GGO), most commonly affecting the right middle lobe and lingula, followed by a mosaic pattern of air trapping often involving multiple lobes. Other findings are less specific and include consolidation, hyperinflation, linear and reticular opacities, and bronchial wall thickening.Treatment and prognosisTreatment is generally supportive with no current consensus, but consists of: supplemental oxygen if hypoxic adequate nutrition steroids treatment of overlapping infections immunization  Long term prognosis of neuroendocrine cell hyperplasia of infancy is generally good with most patients improving over time, however some patients may develop persistent lung disease with airway obstruction and recurrent respiratory infections.Differential diagnosis infective lung diseases cystic fibrosis other childhood interstitial lung diseasespulmonary interstitial glycogenosis   pulmonary hypoplasia chronic neonatal lung disease of prematurity surfactant dysfunction disorders 
__label__Oncology Neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) represent a wide spectrum of disease. They consist of a large heterogeneous group of malignancies that are derived from embryonic neural crest tissue found in various organ such as the hypothalamus, pituitary gland, thyroid gland, adrenal medulla, and gastrointestinal tract. The spectrum of neuroendocrine tumors range from:  carcinoid tumor: arising from enterochromaffin cells and can occur at various sites such as thymus, lung, ovary   pheochromocytoma: typically occurs in the adrenals but can also occur in extra-adrenal sites location dependent entities abdomen gastrointestinal tract neuroendocrine tumors   pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (pNET)   thorax/lung: pulmonary neuroendocrine tumors  endocrine glands thyroid: medullary thyroid tumors     PathologyThey can also be divided by their biochemical behavior as functioning or non-functioning, by their aggressiveness as slow-growing and more aggressive lesions and so on.Because of secretory products by amine precursor uptake and decarboxylation (APUD) they were historically known as APUDomas.GeneticsMostly occur sporadically, some are linked to multiple endocrine neoplasia syndromes.

__label__Paediatrics __label__Central __label__Nervous __label__System Neurofibromas are benign peripheral nerve sheath tumors usually solitary and sporadic, however, there is a strong association with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). These tumors present as a well-defined hypodense mass with minimal or no contrast enhancement on CT. On MRI, they usually are T1 hypointense and T2 hyperintense with heterogeneous contrast enhancement. Neurofibromas are generally divided into three subtypes 1-8: localized neurofibroma localized cutaneous neurofibroma localized intraneural neurofibroma    diffuse cutaneous neurofibroma (superficial)  plexiform neurofibroma (deep) Diffuse cutaneous neurofibromas and plexiform neurofibromas are discussed separately, and localized cutaneous neurofibromas are generally not a radiological diagnosis. As such, the remainder of this article is a general discussion focusing on the most common localized intraneural neurofibromas which are by far the most common form of neurofibroma, representing 90% of these lesions 2. On this page:  Article: Epidemiology Clinical presentation Pathology Macroscopic appearance Radiographic features Treatment and prognosis References   Images:Cases and figures  EpidemiologyPeak presentation is between 20 and 30 years of age 5 with no sex predilection.AssociationsThe majority of localized intraneural neurofibromas are solitary and sporadic and not associated with neurofibromatosis type 1. However, when multiple neurofibromas are present (or plexiform neurofibromas) then the diagnosis of NF1 is almost assured.Clinical presentationThe clinical presentation of localized intraneural neurofibromas is non-specific and the result of either mass effect on surrounding lesions (or palpable lump) or neurogenic dysfunction. PathologyLocalized intraneural neurofibromas are benign neoplasms composed of Schwann cells and fibroblasts, containing a rich network of collagen fibers. They are mostly indolent tumors that rarely only undergo malignant transformation into a malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST); this is only really seen in large neurofibromas, and even then it only occurs in 5-10% of tumors 6. Neurofibromas are therefore considered WHO grade I tumors under the current (2016) WHO classification of CNS tumors 6.Macroscopic appearanceUnlike schwannomas, neurofibromas are not encapsulated and infiltrate between the nerve fascicles. They primarily affect superficial cutaneous nerves, however occasionally affect larger deep-seated nerves. Radiographic featuresGeneral imaging features of neurofibromas:CT well-defined hypodense mass minimal or no contrast enhancement MRI  T1: hypointense  T2 hyperintense  target sign a hyperintense rim and central area of a low signal may be seen this is thought to be due to a dense central area of collagenous stroma although this sign is highly suggestive of neurofibroma, it is occasionally also seen in schwannomas and malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors    fascicular sign    T1 C+ (Gd): heterogeneous enhancement Treatment and prognosis lesions not associated with NF1 localized and diffuse lesions may be treated surgically however, as neurofibromas infiltrate between nerve fascicles, they are unable to be separated from the parent nerve and complete excision requires the sacrifice of the nerve deep-seated lesions are therefore often managed conservatively local recurrence after excision is uncommon and malignant transformation is rare 2    lesions associated with NF1 due to the multiplicity of lesions, unless debilitating symptoms are present, treatment of patients with NF1 is often non-surgical plexiform neurofibromas are particularly difficult to resect, often leading to incomplete resection.  recurrence after resection is frequent plexiform neurofibromas demonstrate a significant potential for malignant transformation   
__label__Central __label__Nervous __label__System Neurofibromatoses (NF) comprise a number of clinically and genetically distinct inherited conditions that carry a high risk of tumor formation.

__label__Central __label__Nervous __label__System Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), also known as von Recklinghausen disease, is a multisystem neurocutaneous disorder, the most common phakomatosis, and a RASopathy. Additionally, it is also one of the most common inherited CNS disorders, autosomal dominant disorders and inherited tumor syndromes. Individual systemic manifestations are discussed individually:  breast manifestations of NF1 central nervous system manifestations of NF1 cutaneous manifestations of NF1 musculoskeletal manifestations of NF1 pulmonary manifestations of NF1 orbital manifestations of NF1 The remainder of this article pertains to a general discussion of neurofibromatosis type 1.  On this page:  Article: Epidemiology Clinical presentation Pathology Radiographic features Treatment and prognosis History and etymology See also Related articles References   Images:Cases and figures  EpidemiologyNeurofibromatosis affects 1:2500-3000 individuals 3. In half of the cases, the disease is inherited as an autosomal dominant condition. In the other half, the disease is due to a de novo mutation 6. There is a variable expression but 100% penetrance by 5 years of age 6.Clinical presentationAs is the case with many phakomatoses, NF1 results in a variety of abnormalities of variable severity. To make the clinical diagnosis two or more of the following are required 2: >6 cafe au lait spots evident during one year two or more neurofibromas or one plexiform neurofibroma  optic nerve glioma  distinctive osseous lesion (such as sphenoid wing dysplasia or thinning of long bone cortex with or without pseudoarthrosis) two or more iris hamartomas (Lisch nodules)    axillary or inguinal freckling a primary relative with NF1 with above criteria A mnemonic to help remember these features is CAFE SPOT.In addition, ~45% (range 30-60%) of patients have learning disabilities, and approximately 1% have hypertension due to renal artery stenosis.It is important to consider that NF1 has a much earlier age of onset than schwannomatosis and NF2, with approximately 50% of patients meeting the diagnostic criteria for NF1 by the age of 1 year and approximately 97% meeting the criteria by the age of 8 years 10. NeoplasmsIt should come as no surprise that a disease due to inactivation of a tumor suppressor gene (see below) is also associated with an increased incidence of numerous tumors 1-6: pheochromocytoma  malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST)  ( ~10% of patients)  7  Wilms tumor rhabdomyosarcoma renal angiomyolipoma glioma  juvenile pilocytic astrocytoma (~20% of patients) 13  optic nerve glioma diffuse brainstem glioma  spinal astrocytoma and spinal pilocytic astrocytoma 9    carcinoid tumor(s) leiomyoma(s) leiomyosarcoma ganglioglioma leukemia PathologyThe NF1 gene locus is on chromosome 17q11.2 and the gene product is neurofibromin, which acts as a tumor suppressor of the Ras/MAPK pathway; inactivation of the gene thus predisposes to tumor development 6,12,13. For this reason, the disorder is classified as a RASopathy 12.The disease primarily is a hamartomatous disorder that involves the ectoderm and mesoderm. Usually, three types of neurofibromas occur in this disorder and are distinguished on the basis of their gross and microscopic appearances.   localized neurofibroma (cutaneous neurofibroma): the most common type, is a focal lesion that typically is located in the dermis and subcutis  diffuse neurofibroma (subcutaneous neurofibroma): localized in the subcutis, usually in the head and neck region.   plexiform neurofibroma: considered pathognomonic if present; they may be seen in virtually any location but usually occur in the neck, pelvis, and extremities  Radiographic featuresBreastneurofibromatosis of the breastCentral nervous system  FASI (focal areas of signal intensity): occur in deep white matter and basal ganglia or corpus callosum 5, areas of T2/FLAIR hyperintensity with no contrast enhancement  optic nerve glioma or optic pathway glioma (may manifest as enlarged optic foramen) progressive sphenoid wing dysplasia   lambdoid suture defects dural calcification at the vertex  moya-moya phenomenon (rare) buphthalmos Cutaneouscutaneous and subcutaneous neurofibromas: benign peripheral nerve sheath tumorsSkeletal kyphoscoliosis posterior vertebral scalloping  hypoplastic posterior elements enlarged neural foramina  ribbon rib deformity, rib notching, and dysplasia  dural ectasia  tibial pseudoarthrosis or, less commonly, ulnar pseudoarthrosis bony dysplasias: especially affecting tibia severe bowing, gracile bones 11  multiple non-ossifying fibromas  limb hemihypertrophy Thoracic mediastinal masses    neurofibroma  lateral thoracic meningocele: typically on the convex side of scoliosis (through widened neural foramina) extra-adrenal pheochromocytoma    lung parenchymal disease: ~20%  diffuse interstitial fibrosis: lower zone  bullae formation: upper zone secondary pulmonary arterial hypertension and cor pulmonale    Vascular  aneurysms / arteriovenous malformations  renal artery stenosis coarctation of aorta Treatment and prognosisNo single treatment exists, and a combination of supportive and surgical therapies are employed depending on the specific tumors and anomalies present. Although prognosis is very variable, overall life expectancy is approximately half that of non affected individuals. Tumors or cardiovascular complications are the most common causes of mortality 8.History and etymologyThe first name of this condition was Von Recklinghausen disease because, in 1882, von Recklinghausen described cases of neurofibromatosis and recognized it as a nosological entity 14. See alsopediatric mediastinal masses

__label__Central __label__Nervous __label__System Neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) is a rare autosomal dominant neurocutaneous disorder (phakomatosis) manifesting as a development of multiple CNS tumors. Unlike neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), it is not associated with neurofibromas.  Instead, patients with this disease have: intracranial schwannoma(s): mostly vestibular schwannoma(s) sometimes patients may have spinal schwannomas  intracranial and spinal meningioma(s)  intraspinal-intramedullary ependymoma(s)   On this page:  Article: Terminology Epidemiology Pathology Radiographic features Practical points Related articles References   Images:Cases and figures  TerminologyThese features give rise to the acronym MISME, which describes Multiple Inherited Schwannomas Meningiomas and Ependymomas 4. In fact, labeling  this disorder neurofibromatosis type 2 is a misnomer, because neurofibromas are not a part of its constellation of abnormalities 5. EpidemiologyThe disease is rare with an estimated prevalence of 1:50,000. NF2 usually presents in young adults (age 18-24 years) 7.Of patients with NF2, 50% have an affected parent (autosomal dominant inheritance) and 50% having a de novo mutation 6,7.PathologyThe NF2 gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 22 (22q12) and encodes the merlin protein (also known as "schwannomin"). It plays a role in contact inhibition of growth and has tumor suppressor function at least in part according to this mechanism 9. Although variably expressed throughout the body during human development, merlin is highly expressed in adult neuronal, Schwann, and meningeal cells. Mutations in NF2 cause loss of protein function, resulting in a predisposition to tumor formation throughout the nervous system 9.Although meningiomas are often isolated findings in adults, their presence in a child should raise suspicion regarding NF2. The presence of multiple and different types of spinal tumors also raise a high suspicion of NF2 1.AssociationsThere can also be associated syringohydromyelia with lesions in the spine 1 as well as cataracts 3.Radiographic featuresPlease refer articles on individual lesions for respective specific imaging features: meningioma  schwannoma usually an inferior vestibular division of cranial nerve eight can also be from the facial nerve    ependymoma: usually spinal intramedullary (not intracranial/intraventricular) Practical pointsBilateral vestibular schwannomas are diagnostic of NF2 7 but care should be taken because bilateral internal acoustic meatus masses are not specific for vestibular schwannoma and can represent, for example, sarcoid or metastases 6.

Voiding is often preserved.Motor paralytic bladderAtonic large bladder with inability of detrusor contraction during voiding.Uninhibited neurogenic bladderRounded bladder with a trabeculated appearance to the mucosa above the trigone from detrusor contractions. On voiding large interureteric ridge is noted Reflex neurogenic bladderResults from detrusor hyperreflexia with a dyssynergic sphincter. This leads to contrast extension to the posterior urethra and an elongated pointed urthera with pseudodiverticula.Autonomous neurogenic bladderIntermediate between detrusor hyperreflexia (contracted) and dysreflexia (atonic).UltrasoundDetailed images of the bladder often demonstrate a thick wall with a small contracted or large atonic bladder. A large post void residual is often noted.TreatmentDepending on the etiology, various techniques can be employed to maintain renal function and prevent urinary tract infections. Self catheterization, medication or surgical interventions including cystoplasty or sphincterotomy can be employed.Differential diagnosisImaging differential considerations include: bladder outlet obstruction cystic pelvic mass posterior urethral valves myelodysplasia See also pine-cone bladder voiding cystourethrography 
__label__Chest Neurogenic pulmonary edema is an etiological subtype of non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema, classified as a subtype of the acute respiratory distress syndrome by the Berlin definition.The diagnosis of neurogenic pulmonary edema is based on the occurrence of edema after a neurologic event/insult and the exclusion of other plausible causes.

The route of transmission commonly occurs through skin abrasion or by inhalation of contaminated water or soil. Risk factors include diabetes mellitus, alcohol intake, chronic renal disease, lung disease, and immunosuppression 1. Melioidosis can involve multiple body systems but central nervous system infection has a mortality rate of approximately 25% and survivors have significant morbidity 1.

__label__Central __label__Nervous __label__System __label__Spine Neuromyelis optica (NMO) and neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) are closely related severe demyelinating diseases caused by an autoantibody to the aquaporin-4 water channel. The classic presentation of NMO is with the triad of optic neuritis, longitudinally extensive myelitis, and positive anti-AQP4 antibody, although a far wider range of manifestations are now recognized as part of NMOSD 8-13. On this page:  Article: Terminology Epidemiology Clinical presentation Pathology Radiographic features Treatment and prognosis History and etymology Differential diagnosis Practical points Related articles References   Images: Cases and figures Imaging differential diagnosis   TerminologyNeuromyelitis optica (NMO) was previously referred to as Devic disease, and traditionally NMO was thought to have limited if any intracranial manifestations. Over the past decade, however, a far wider range of manifestations have been recognized as belonging together and thus the term NMOSD has been proposed to encompass them all. EpidemiologyNeuromyelitis optica is typically found in patients somewhat older than those with multiple sclerosis (MS), with an average of presentation of 41 years, and there is an even stronger female predilection (F:M  6.5:1) 6,8. It is found more frequently in patients of Asian, Indian, and African descent 8. Clinical presentationNMO is characterized by bilateral optic neuritis and myelitis resulting in blindness and paraplegia. Although the two usually present concurrently, it is not uncommon for one to precede the other by up to several weeks 3. Additionally, it is now recognized that some patients present with unilateral optic nerve involvement. Although NMO was initially thought of as a monophasic illness, it is now evident that, as with MS, it is usually a relapsing-remitting disease with symptomatic events separated by many years 5. Furthermore, NMOSD also encompasses non-neurological manifestations in anti-AQP4 antibody seropositive patients including systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and Sjögren syndrome 13.The current diagnostic criteria are defined by the International Panel for NMO Diagnosis.PathologyIn approximately 70% (sensitivity of 70-90%; specificity of 90%) of patients with established NMO, a specific immunoglobulin can be isolated (AQP4-IgG which targets a transmembrane water channel (aquaporin 4) present on astrocyte foot processes abutting the limiting membrane 5,8. This accounts for some of the predilection for the circumventricular organs (e.g. periaqueductal grey matter) which are particularly rich in aquaporin 4 8. Early in the disease, demyelinating regions will demonstrate similar findings to MS, such as macrophage/microglia activation and axonal damage. Additionally, however, and relatively specific for NMO, these regions will also demonstrate extensive eosinophilic infiltration, perivascular deposition of immunoglobulins (especially IgM) and local activation of the complement cascade 3. Another differentiating feature is that axonal damage precedes demyelination in NMO 5. Generally, the condition is sporadic, although some overlap in immunogenic features between certain viruses and aquaporin-4 water channel have been identified 8. A significant proportion of individuals presenting with NMO but without AQP4 antibodies will be found to have anti-MOG IgG antibodies 16. These individuals appear to have somewhat different demographics and less severe clinical course 16. Radiographic featuresMRIMRI is the modality of choice for NMOSD and the orbits, brain and spinal cord should be imaged in suspected cases. OrbitsTargeted imaging of the orbits (including fat saturated T1 C+ and T2 weighted sequences (see MRI protocol: orbit) may demonstrate typical features of optic neuritis:  optic nerves appearing hyperintense and swollen on T2 weighted sequences and enhancing on T1 C+ bilateral optic nerve involvement and extension of the abnormal signal posteriorly as far as the chiasm is particularly suggestive of NMO 5  atrophy of the optic nerves with associated hyperintensities on T2 weighted sequences may be seen in chronic stages of the disease 11  BrainAlthough traditionally NMO was thought to have normal intracranial appearance it is increasingly evident that asymptomatic abnormalities are present in the majority of seropositive NMOSD patients. These can be divided into four categories 5,8,13: lesions which mirror the distribution of aquaporin 4 in the brain, which is particularly found in the periependymal regions abutting the ventricles: periventricular (hemispheric) confluent smooth sessile white matter involvement (unlike MS, there are usually no Dawson's fingers) periaqueductal grey matter hypothalamus/medial thalamus dorsal pons/medulla  corpus callosum multiple callosal lesions with heterogeneous signal leading to a marbled pattern 7  the splenium may be diffusely involved and expanded     deep (or less frequently subcortical) punctate white matter lesions (which may appear similar to those seen in MS)  corticospinal tract involvement by extensive longitudinal lesions; has been reported more frequently in Korean patients 5  larger >3 cm diameter hemispheric white matter lesions radially oriented (spilled-ink appearances) or spindle-shaped limited if any mass effect although tumefactive lesions do occur 13  may involve overlying cortex 14  facilitated diffusion may be more common in children and in patients from the Far East and Africa often vanish but cystic change is seen in a minority of cases 13    Spinal cordSpinal cord involvement is extensive, with high T2 signal spanning at least three vertebral segments, often many more (known as a longitudinally extensive spinal cord lesion) 4,5,8,11. Cord swelling is usually present in the acute phase. Although less common, short transverse myelitis is seen in 14.5% of cases 11.Bright spotty lesions are a specific feature of NMO. It consists of marked T2 hyperintense (higher than CSF) and T1 hypointense foci in the central grey matter.Imaging features include 5,8:   T1 hypointense follow-up scans may demonstrate cord atrophy and low T1 signal 5     T2 hyperintense (often >3 vertebral body lengths)  central grey matter involvement bright spotty lesions (see above)    T1 C+ (Gd) enhancement is common and variable in appearance ring-enhancement seen in a third of patients 17  both on sagittal and axial imaging often ring extends over multiple vertebral levels    patchy "cloud-like" enhancement of the aforementioned T2 bright lesions may be present thin ependymal enhancement similar to ependymitis  lens-shaped enhancement on sagittal images 11    Treatment and prognosisTreatment of NMO is evolving, with immunosuppression (e.g. anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody rituximab) appearing effective 5.It is important to distinguish NMO from MS as the treatment not only is different but treating a patient with NMO with MS-specific therapies (e.g. beta-interferon or natalizumab) can actually lead to its exacerbation 5. Patients with a relapsing course have a poorer prognosis 4: blind in one or both eyes: monophasic  22% vs. relapsing 60% monoplegia or paraplegia: monophasic 31% vs. relapsing 52% History and etymologyThe disease was first described in 1870 by Sir Thomas Clifford Allbutt 12. The French term "neuromyélite optique aiguë" (literally acute optic neuromyelitis) was later coined by Dr Eugène Devic and Fernand Gault in 1894 in a case series of 16 patients 12. At the time, the disorder was thought to be acute and monophasic.For many years, it was considered to be a subtype of multiple sclerosis, until the discovery of anti aquaporin-4 antibodies at which time it was moved into its own disease category. It is now evident that a significant proportion of patients with clinical NMO do not have the anti-AQP4-antibody (some have anti-MOG-antibodies for example) and that the presentation can be more heterogeneous. At present, therefore, the term neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) is now used. It is very likely that there will be significant further evolution of our understanding of this disease in the near future. Differential diagnosisThe differential diagnosis depends on the presentation, and when classic, the diagnosis can be made with a fair degree of certainty. The most important clinical and imaging differential is MS as both can present with optic neuritis, cerebral and spinal demyelination including involvement of the corpus callosum (see Practical points).For patients with cerebral involvement, the differential is broad and includes: multiple sclerosis  Susac syndrome: involves the central portion of the corpus callosum  neuro-Behçet: mesodiencephalic involvement is typical primary angiitis of the CNS (PACNS)  acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM): grey-white matter involvement with a more tumefactive appearance  amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS): bilateral corticospinal tract involvement is more symmetrical For patients with optic nerve involvement, the differential is that of optic neuritis.For patients with spinal cord involvement, the differential is that of a longitudinally extensive spinal cord lesion. For the typical bright spotty lesion, an important differential is acute spinal cord ischemia.Practical pointsThere are many features that distinguish NMO from multiple sclerosis, although none are pathognomonic. It should also be noted that overlap of imaging findings of these two entities may be higher in Asian populations 15. Nonetheless, features that are helpful in favoring NMO over multiple sclerosis include 5,7,15:  brain smooth confluent periependymal distribution (see above) fewer oval perivenular orientation of periventricular lesions (no Dawson's fingers) fewer juxtacortic lesions (U-fiber) more extensive involvement of the corpus callosum (especially its ependymal surface) larger, more confluent lesions lack of open ring enhancement  corticospinal tract and diencephalic involvement (see above)   spinal cordmore longitudinally extensive spinal cord lesionpreferential involvement of the central cord rather than the peripheral cord   optic nervesmore longitudinally extensive optic neuritiswith preferential involvement of the posterior optic pathway

__label__Central __label__Nervous __label__System Neurons are cells of the central nervous system, located within the grey matter, and responsible for all neurological functions of the brain.  On this page:  Article: Structure Immunophenotype Types of neurons Etymology and spelling Related articles References   StructureNeurons vary in morphology and size substantially, but all share a number of features 1: a cell body nucleus perikaryon: cytoplasm surrounding the nucleus   axon a single process of variable length (even over a meter) generally the 'output' of the neuron terminates in terminal buttons which release neurotransmitters   dendrites usually multiple branching processes generally the 'input' of the neuron   Generally, input from other neurons or sensory receptors received by dendrites may lead to an action potential within the cell body which then propagates down the axon, eventually resulting in the release of neurotransmitters from the terminal buttons. This, in turn, can affect other neurons or end organs 1. ImmunophenotypeA number of markers are useful to identify neurons, typically marking the body and dendrites 3:   synaptophysin: a presynaptic vesicle protein  NeuN: a neuronal nuclear protein microtubule-associated protein-2 (MAP2) neurofilament subunits Types of neuronsThree main morphological patterns of neurons are described, depending on the relationship of the cell body to the axon and dendrites 1.  multipolar bipolar pseudounipolar Additional variation in morphology and size results in a variety of specific neuron types, depending on the location within the nervous system. For example within the cerebral cortex five types of neurons are present 1: pyramidal cells fusiform cells cells of Martinotti horizontal cells of Cajal stellate cells Pyramidal cellsPyramidal cells are by far the most common neuron type found in human neocortex, and are located in layers II, III, V and VI (see below). They are, as their name suggests, pyramidal in shape with the apex pointing outwards, towards the pial surface of the brain. From the apex, a thick single dendrite extends towards more superficial layers and branches into numerous dendrites. From the base of the cell body, an axon extends into deeper layers and/or into the subcortical white matter. Additional dendrites extend from the base of the cell body to connect with other neurons in the same layer 1. The largest examples of pyramidal cells are the Betz cells found in the motor cortex 1. Fusiform cellsFusiform cells extend orthogonally to their cell layer with dendrites extending from either end into deeper and more superficial layers. From the cell body, an axon arises which passes superficially 1. Cells of MartinottiCells of Martinotti are small cells with a limited number of short dendrites and an axon which extends superficially 1. Horizontal cells of CajalHorizontal cells of Cajal are only found in layer I and are the least common cell type. They are also fusiform in shape but are aligned parallel to their cell layer with their axon extending laterally within the layer to synapse with nearby pyramidal cells 1. Stellate cellsStellate cells, also known as granule cells, are rounded with short dendrites radiating circumferentially out from the body. They are predominantly found in layers II, IV and VI 1. Etymology and spellingYou may have, as many have before you 2, been confused about the spelling of neuron vs neuron. Generally, the UK spelling is with a terminal 'e' (neuron) rather than the US spelling without the 'e' (neuron).

__label__Central __label__Nervous __label__System Central nervous system involvement by sarcoidosis, also termed neurosarcoidosis, is relatively common among patients with systemic sarcoidosis and has a bewildering variety of manifestations, often making diagnosis difficult. For a general discussion of the underlying condition, please refer to the article sarcoidosis.  On this page:  Article: Epidemiology Clinical presentation Pathology Radiographic features Treatment and prognosis Differential diagnosis Related articles References   Images:Cases and figures  EpidemiologyThe demographics of affected patients is similar to that of systemic sarcoidosis, typically affecting patients 30-40 years of age with a female predilection 2.Clinical presentationCentral nervous system involvement by sarcoidosis is very variable, with lesions potentially involving the leptomeninges, pituitary and parenchyma of all parts of the intracranial compartment. Thus, clinical presentation is also very variable and nonspecific: signs and symptoms of raised intracranial pressure due to hydrocephalus  cranial nerve palsies  optic nerve involvement (particularly common) 5   facial nerve palsy    endocrine features of hypothalamic/pituitary sarcoidosis 7 diabetes insipidus SIADH hyperprolactinemia hypothyroidism hypoadrenalism   seizures variable weakness, paresthesias and dysarthria/dysphagia spinal cord involvement presenting as myelopathy 5  Although it is very rare (range 1-17% 1,6) to have isolated neurosarcoidosis (i.e. without systemic disease), central nervous system symptoms are not uncommonly the first manifestation, and as such patients are often imaged without the diagnosis of systemic sarcoidosis having yet been made. Interestingly up to 10% of patients with the systemic disease will demonstrate positive imaging findings; thus not all patients with demonstrable imaging findings of neurosarcoidosis are symptomatic. PathologyHistologically, central nervous system involvement is seen in ~20% (range 14-27%) of patients with systemic sarcoidosis, although only ~10% (range 3-15%) are symptomatic 1-3. Radiographic featuresThe radiographic features of neurosarcoidosis can be thought of as occurring in one or more of five compartments. From superficial to deep they are: skull vault involvement (refer to musculoskeletal manifestations of sarcoidosis) pachymeningeal involvement leptomeningeal involvement (seen in up to 40% of cases 1)  pituitary and hypothalamic involvement cranial nerve involvement   parenchymal involvement (most common) CTAlthough CT is usually the first modality used in the workup of patients with neurosarcoidosis, it is not as sensitive or specific as MRI, with up to 60% of patients with subsequently proven neurosarcoidosis having negative CT scans 2. The features will be similar and regions that demonstrate enhancement on MRI may also be seen to enhance on CT, although often less dramatically. On non-contrast scanning lesions, be they pachymeningeal, leptomeningeal or parenchymal, can appear hyperdense 2. Often the only finding is hydrocephalus due to occult leptomeningeal disease 2. MRIMRI with contrast is the modality of choice for investigating suspected neurosarcoidosis. In general, lesions follow a standard signal intensity 1,2:  T1: iso- or hypointense to adjacent grey matter  T2 variable most are hyperintense some lesions can be iso- or hypointense    T1 C+ (Gd): homogeneous enhancement Pachymeningeal involvementPachymeningeal disease often takes the form of pachymeningeal thickening with homogeneous enhancement. In some cases, the masses can be low on T2 weighted images, which although a helpful clue, is not pathognomonic. Leptomeningeal involvementThe primary sequence is T1 weighted with contrast, as quite prominent changes may be inapparent on other sequences. There may be focal or generalized leptomeningeal enhancement 3: particularly around the basal aspects of the brain and circle of Willis  nodular or smooth  may follow perforating vessels up into the brain (via the perivascular spaces)  sometimes referred to as tongues of fire sign 2  can mimic parenchymal lesions can result in a CNS vasculitis picture, especially if a leptomeningeal disease is subtle elsewhere 1,2    may lead to hydrocephalus  Pituitary and hypothalamic involvementAlthough pituitary and hypothalamic involvement are frequently seen as part of a more extensive leptomeningeal disease, it may also be encountered in isolation, sometimes with limited disease confined to the infundibulum. Cranial nerve involvementCranial nerves may be involved either as part of a more widespread leptomeningeal disease or in isolation. Although any nerve can be involved, the facial nerve and optic nerve are most commonly affected:  facial nerve involvement is usually symptomatic but is often normal on imaging  optic nerve involvement can be anywhere along its course from the globe to the optic chiasm  Also, see orbital manifestations of sarcoidosis for a discussion of the non-optic nerve orbital disease spectrum.Parenchymal involvementParenchymal involvement is the most common finding and can be in many forms 1,5: extension of leptomeningeal disease up perivascular spaces  periventricular high T2 signal white matter lesions often indistinguishable from multiple sclerosis or leukoaraiosis  may have low T2 signal components (without hemorrhage) due to high cellularity   enhancing masses or nodules Nuclear medicineGallium-67 citrate scan is insensitive to central nervous system involvement, positive in only 5% of cases. However, it is helpful in confirming the presence of a systemic disease when neurological manifestations are the presenting complaint. In this setting, the gallium scan is positive in approximately 45% 1. Care should be taken however in interpreting results as other inflammatory/white cell abundant diseases may also be positive, some of which are on the differential for neurosarcoidosis (e.g. tuberculosis and lymphoma). Treatment and prognosisTreatment of neurosarcoidosis remains poorly established. Corticosteroids are the mainstay of therapy with methotrexate sometimes used as a second line agent 1. It is important to note that imaging correlates poorly with treatment response. Recurrence of symptoms and imaging evidence of disease progression is common. Differential diagnosisThe differential is broad and depends on the pattern of involvement. For pachymeningeal involvement consider meningioma  dural metastases including lymphoma Erdheim-Chester disease idiopathic hypertrophic cranial pachymeningitis For leptomeningeal involvement consider tuberculous leptomeningitis lymphoma/leukemia infiltration leptomeningeal metastases  CNS cryptococcosiscryptococcal meningitis is a rare but life-threatening complication of sarcoidosis and patient's may be misdiagnosed as neurosarcoidosis, which can result in considerable treatment delay and worse outcome. CSF cryptococcal antigen tests are advised in patients with sarcoidosis and meningitis 8   For pituitary and hypothalamic involvement consider Langerhans cell histiocytosis  pituicytoma  ectopic posterior pituitary: intrinsic high T1 signal lymphocytic hypophysitis IgG4-related hypophysitis metastasis local masses meningioma optic nerve glioma hypothalamic astrocytoma   For cranial nerve involvement considerin addition to all causes of leptomeningeal disease (see above), specific entities to be considered include 1: optic nerve optic neuritis optic nerve glioma optic nerve meningioma  For parenchymal involvement consider multiple sclerosis ADEM  leukoaraiosis: in asymptomatic cases, it is often not possible to distinguish between these and neurosarcoidosis lesions when enhancing other entities to consider include: cerebral metastases  tumefactive demyelination or acute demyelination primary brain tumors   
__label__Central __label__Nervous __label__System __label__Head __label__& __label__Neck __label__Vascular Neurosyphilis results from infection of the central nervous system by the spirochete Treponema pallidum, subspecies pallidum. The disease has a heterogeneous spectrum of early and late manifestations.For a general discussion, and for links to other system-specific manifestations, please refer to the article on syphilis.  On this page:  Article: Epidemiology Clinical presentation Pathology Radiographic features Treatment and prognosis Related articles References   Images:Cases and figures  EpidemiologyThis disease is a rare entity in the current antibiotic era, but when present, tends to be seen in association with HIV or AIDS, affecting approximately 1.5% of that population demographic 1. Of all patients who are diagnosed with syphilis and are left untreated, between 5-10% of patients will have evidence of symptomatic neurosyphilis 1. Clinical presentationThe clinical presentation is very varied and largely depends on the temporal stage of the disease and the corresponding area of the central nervous system that has been affected. In addition to features of neurosyphilis, signs and symptoms of secondary and other forms of tertiary syphilis may also be present 1-6.However, in the modern era where this disease most often co-exists with HIV, late signs of neurosyphilis are rarely seen 5. This is because patients with HIV and neurosyphilis who do not receive treatment for either tend to develop fatal intercurrent infections and complications of AIDS before the late signs of neurosyphilis are able to manifest 5.Early neurosyphilis asymptomatic neurosyphilis patients are asymptomatic and will only have evidence of neurosyphilis in CSF analysis 1,4  occurs weeks to months after infection 3,4    acute syphilitic meningitis clinical features identical to those of a bacterial leptomeningitis, such as headache, neck stiffness, seizures, cranial neuropathies, and raised intracranial pressure or hydrocephalus 1,4  may be associated with the development of syphilitic gummas and focal pachymeningitis, similar to other granulomatous diseases such as tuberculosis or neurosarcoidosis, that can have clinical features of an intracranial mass (especially if they invade into the brain parenchyma) or spinal cord compression 1,2,4  may be associated with myelitis (acute syphilitic meningomyelitis) resulting in upper motor neuron lesion signs on examination such as spastic paresis and hyperreflexia 7,8  occurs months to years after infection 3,4    meningovascular syphilis prodrome of mild clinical features of syphilitic meningitis 4,9  this is followed by an arteritis of vessels in the subarachnoid space, ultimately leading to ischemic stroke (which may be the presenting feature) of the brain and/or spinal cord 1,2,4,9  there may also or alternatively be evidence of acute encephalitis presenting identically to herpes simplex encephalitis, a manifestation that is increasingly common in the HIV/AIDS demographic 10  occurs months to years after infection 3,4    ocular syphilis clinical features vary depending on the exact structures of the eye that are involved, but most commonly posterior uveitis (including posterior placoid chorioretinitis) or panuveitis are seen and present with progressively worsening visual acuity 4,11,12  occurs months to years after infection 11,12     otosyphilis (or otitic syphilis) presenting with sensorineural hearing loss, tinnitus, and vertigo due to involvement of inner ear structures 4,13  occurs months to years after infection 13    Late neurosyphilis general paresis (or general paralysis of the insane) characterized by dementia with marked personality changes 4  occurs years to decades after infection 3,4     tabes dorsalis presents with symptoms related to dorsal column and dorsal root involvement such as sensory ataxia (tabetic gait), lancinating neuropathic pains, and urinary incontinence 4  many patients also have the classic Argyll Robertson pupil that responds to accommodation but not to light 4  occurs decades after infection, often as the final manifestation 3,4    CSFCharacteristic lumbar puncture findings depend on the temporal stage of the disease, but generally include 1,5,6,10: a degree of lymphocytosis  moderately elevated protein levels  reactive CSF-VDRL or CSF FTA-ABS tests PathologyIt is thought that Treponema pallidum, subspecies pallidum, spreads to the central nervous system through invasion of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) 1,4. Thus, initial early manifestations of neurosyphilis include asymptomatic CSF infection before progressing to acute syphilitic meningitis that may have accompanying ocular disease (ocular syphilis) or inner ear disease (otosyphilis) 1,4. The disease then infiltrates the blood vessels of the subarachnoid space leading to arteritis in meningovascular syphilis 1,4. Finally, in late stages of the disease after many years or even decades, the brain parenchyma and spinal cord white matter tracts are then involved leading to general paresis and tabes dorsalis 1,4. The pathogenesis of acute encephalitis seen alongside meningovascular syphilis in HIV/AIDS patients remains unclear 10,14.Radiographic featuresAs with the clinical features, neurosyphilis can have a variety of radiographic presentations 1-3.Early neurosyphilis asymptomatic neurosyphilis: no radiographic features acute syphilitic meningitis:  leptomeningeal enhancement that may be either focal or diffuse 1,2  if cranial neuropathies are present then cranial nerve enhancement may be appreciated, most commonly of CN VII and CN VIII 1,2,14  syphilitic gummas, if present, appear as small focal nodules adjacent to the meninges that are isodense on CT, hypointense on T1-weighted MRI, hyperintense on T2-weighted MRI, have high diffusion signal on DWI, and exhibit homogeneous contrast-enhancement on T1-weighted MRI or on contrast-enhanced CT; they may additionally have a dural tail sign, evidence of focal pachymeningitis, and surrounding cerebral edema 1,2,15appearance can mimic brain tumor or pyogenic abscess 15   syphilitic meningomyelitis, if present, is associated with T2-weighted long-segment intrinsic spinal cord hyperintensities, most commonly in the thoracic cord, which may or may not involve the dorsal columns 7    meningovascular syphilis: radiographic features of syphilitic meningitis such as leptomeningeal enhancement and presence of syphilitic gummas 1,2,7,9  focal segmental vascular narrowing and ‘beading’ may be seen on angiographic studies 1,2,7,9arteritis of small vessels has historically been eponymously termed Nissl-Alzheimer arteritis while arteritis of medium and large vessels, which is more common, is similarly named Heubner arteritis 2,7-9   regions of cortical or subcortical infarction in any vascular territory (see ischemic stroke for detailed temporal radiographical features) 1,2,7,9  if acute encephalitis is present, the radiographical features of mesiotemporal T2-weighted hyperintensities seen are indistinguishable from herpes simplex encephalitis 10,14; there may also be residual atrophic cerebral changes seen once the acute phase has resolved 8    ocular syphilis: often no radiographic features 12  otosyphilis (or otitic syphilis): gummas may be seen in the internal auditory canal 16  there may be radiographic evidence of osteitis and osteolysis of the adjacent temporal bone 16    Late neurosyphilis general paresis (or general paralysis of the insane): cerebral atrophy, both central and cortical atrophy may be present 1,2,7   tabes dorsalis: MRI may reveal cord atrophy and longitudinal T2-weighted hyperintensities in the dorsal columns of the spinal cord, mimicking the radiographical appearance of subacute combined degeneration of the cord 17  Treatment and prognosisTreatment is with intravenous penicillin-based antibiotics such as benzathine penicillin G 1,10. Management should also be initiated for HIV if concomitantly present 1,10. Prognosis is generally good unless there are established non-reversible changes such as cerebral infarction or atrophy 1,10.
__label__Central __label__Nervous __label__System Neurotoxoplasmosis, also known as cerebral toxoplasmosis, is an opportunistic infection caused by the parasite Toxoplasma gondii.  It typically affects patients with HIV/AIDS and is the most common cause of cerebral abscess in these patients 6.Congenital toxoplasmosis, as well as congenital cerebral toxoplasmosis, are discussed separately. On this page:  Article: Epidemiology Clinical presentation Pathology Radiographic features Treatment and prognosis Differential diagnosis Related articles References   Images: Cases and figures Imaging differential diagnosis   EpidemiologyToxoplasma gondii is found ubiquitously and antibodies to the organism can be identified in 30% of all humans. The rate varies greatly from population to population and has a wide reported prevalence: from 6-90% 5. In most cases, the infection is asymptomatic. However, in immunocompromised patients (especially those with HIV/AIDS), infection can become established. Cerebral toxoplasmosis is found in 10-34% of autopsies on patients with HIV/AIDS 5.The infection most likely occurs once the CD4+ count has dropped below 200 cells/mm 3,6.Clinical presentationIn immunocompetent patients, acute encephalitis is extremely rare. Even in the immunocompromised, symptoms are typically vague and indolent. Development of new neurological symptoms in these patients should raise high suspicion of cerebral toxoplasmosis.PathologyToxoplasma gondii is an intracellular parasite that infects birds and mammals. Its definitive host is the cat and other Felidae species. Excretion of oocytes in its feces followed by contaminated uncooked consumption by humans can lead to human infection. In immunocompetent individuals, it primarily causes a subclinical or asymptomatic infection. In immunocompromised individuals (e.g. AIDS patients), toxoplasmosis is the most common cause of a brain abscess.Pathologically, parenchymal toxoplasma lesions have three distinct zones: a central avascular zone of coagulative necrosis an intermediate vascular zone containing numerous organisms an outermost zone of encysted organisms; Toxoplasma lesions do not have a capsule Radiographic featuresTypically cerebral toxoplasmosis manifest as multiple lesions, with a predilection for the basal ganglia, thalami, and corticomedullary junction 4.CTTypically, cerebral toxoplasmosis appears as multiple hypodense regions predominantly in the basal ganglia and at the corticomedullary junction.

The exception to this rule are patients who have atypical imaging features (e.g. single lesion) or who are seronegative for Toxoplasma gondii  6. Treatment consists of sulfadiazine with pyrimethamine 6.Differential diagnosisGeneral imaging differential considerations include:  primary CNS lymphoma: see lymphoma vs toxoplasmosis  cerebral metastases other infections  CNS tuberculoma: see CNS tuberculosis  CNS cryptococcosis bacterial abscesses neurocysticercosis   
__label__Vascular __label__Central __label__Nervous __label__System Neurovascular compression syndromes are a form of vascular compression disorders where there is usually compression or distortion of a cranial nerve due to a redundant or aberrant vascular structure.Clinical presentationNot all cases of neurovascular contact are clinically symptomatic. Presentation can be extremely variable depending on which structure is compressed. It can range from trigeminal neuralgia or glossopharyngeal neuralgia (somatic sensory), hemifacial spasm (somatic motor), tinnitus and vertigo (special sensory) and some cases of essential hypertension.PathologyThey are typically caused by arteries that directly contact the cisternal portion of a cranial nerve. The transition zone between the central and peripheral myelin is considered the most vulnerable region for symptomatic neurovascular compression syndromes.
__label__Oncology Neutron therapy is a form of particle therapy using neutrons as the energy-carrying particle. The therapy has shown promise for some malignancies but there have also been problems with accurate dose distributions and late complications. Some of these problems historically were thought to be - at least partially - due to crude facilities. There has been renewed interest in non-proton particle therapies in view of the advances made in the accurate targeting of external beam radiotherapeutic techniques, e.g. IMRT.Neutron therapy remains a very specialized niche modality which is currently only available at a few centers worldwide due to very high associated resource costs.

On this page:  Article: Epidemiology Clinical presentation Pathology Treatment and prognosis History and etymology Differential diagnosis References   EpidemiologyMost often seen in females of reproductive age, especially during the 2nd and 3rd decades of life. Less than 70 cases have been reported till now.Clinical presentationPatients most often are asymptomatic but the lesions may be itchy. Breastfeeding may pose a problem in the affected females. The lesions are characterized by hyperkeratotic, verrucous, hyperpigmented papules and plaques and “café au lait” pigmentation of the nipple and areola. It may involve the nipple, the areola, or both.PathologyEtiology is unknown. A change in estrogen milieu has been proposed as a possible mechanism. Histopathologically, it shows hyperkeratosis, filiform acanthosis, papillomatosis, and keratin plugging.Treatment and prognosisThe main cause for concern in patients of NHNA is the cosmetic appearance of nipple and areola. There is no definitive treatment; however, the various treatments that have been used are topical retinoic acid, topical calcipotriol, low-dose acitretin, cryotherapy, carbon dioxide laser, shave excision, and removal of the areola and reconstruction with a skin graft.Breast function is threatened and it leads to bad aesthetic results, which often lead to mismanagement.History and etymologyIt was first described in medical literature by Tauber in 1923.Differential diagnosisPossible considerations include: epidermal nevus acanthosis nigricans chronic eczema atopic eczema seborrheic keratosis Darier's disease Paget's disease basal cell carcinoma dermatophytosis Bowen's disease

A spectrum of disease between type A and B are encountered.  On this page:  Article: Epidemiology Clinical presentation Treatment and prognosis References   EpidemiologyNPD-A is inherited as an autosomal recessive disease. Clinical presentation is in infancy usually with hepatosplenomegaly followed by neurological manifestations. Clinical presentationChildren most often present with hepatosplenomegaly which can be very pronounced and is usually apparent within the first three months of life 1.  Although initially neurologically intact with normal cognitive and motor development, deficits are usually apparent at 12-months of age. Following this affected children demonstrate progressive deterioration in multiple domains (cognitive, psychiatric, motor) 1. Respiratory involvement is common 1. A classic cherry-red spot of the retina is eventually seen in all affected children 1. Treatment and prognosisIn most cases, deterioration is progressive with death usually occurring before the third year 1. 
__label__Chest __label__Central __label__Nervous __label__System __label__Paediatrics Niemann-Pick disease type B (NPD-B), along with Niemann-Pick disease type A (NPD-A), is an autosomal recessive disorder due to acid sphingomyelinase deficiency resulting in abnormal storage of sphingomyelin.Common manifestation of NPD-B includes hepatosplenomegaly, thrombocytopenia, and variable neurologic deficits. It is caused by mutations in the sphingomyelin phosphodiesterase-1 gene (SMDPD-1). On this page:  Article: Epidemiology Clinical presentation Diagnosis Radiographic features Treatment and prognosis References   EpidemiologyNPD-B is a pan-ethnic, unlike NPD-A which is much more common in Ashkenazi Jews. Its onset is usually in late childhood and is much less severe than NPD-A, with a good prognosis of survival into adulthood.Clinical presentationThe disease is characterized by hepatosplenomegaly during infancy and the majority of patients will develop thrombocytopenia due to hypersplenism.In the liver, the infiltration of foamy cells and ballooning of hepatocytes can lead to various degrees of hepatic fibrosis.Contrary to NPD-A, patients with NPD-B have very little or no central nervous system impairment. In patients who live long enough, however, neurologic disorders such as nystagmus, psychiatric disease, and peripheral neuropathy may occur.Other clinical features include: interstitial lung disease short stature with delayed skeletal maturation ocular abnormalities (cherry red maculae) hyperlipidemia (which can lead to early-onset vascular disease) DiagnosisThe definitive diagnosis of those diseases (NPD-A and B) is based on the demonstration of residual acid sphingomyelinase activity in peripheral blood leukocytes to be <10 percent of controls.SMPD1 mutation can also be evaluated by genetic testing, but it has proven to be most effective in patients of Ashkenazi descent (for type A disease) and of North African descent (for type B disease).Since the exams above are not widely available (especially in developing countries), the combination of blood tests and radiological features below is highly suggestive of this diagnosis: interstitial lung disease hepatosplenomegaly with thrombocytopenia lipid abnormalities in peripheral blood (decreased HDL-c, increased LDL-c, and hypertriglyceridemia) Radiographic featuresPlain radiograph  chest reticulonodular pattern which usually starts in the lower lobes calcified micronodules    skeletal short stature with delayed skeletal maturation osteopenia   CT  chest smooth interlobular and intralobular septal thickening patchy ground-glass attenuation (can form "crazy paving") calcified micronodules thymus and other lymphatic organs may be enlarged    abdomen hepatosplenomegaly (almost always present) 5 with numerous parenchymal calcifications can lead to cirrhosis and hepatic failure unlike the liver, low-density masses can be seen in the spleen    cardiovascularcalcified atherosclerotic plaques  MRI  central nervous systempronounced cerebellar and mild supratentorial atrophy   skeletalreduced signal in bone marrow 5   Treatment and prognosisUsually, these patients suffer from progressive dyspnea due to interstitial lung disease and worsening of hypersplenism.

__label__Central __label__Nervous __label__System Nigrosomes are small clusters of dopaminergic cells within the substantia nigra that exhibit calbindin D28K negativity on immunohistochemistry. Five nigrosomes measuring up to a few millimeters in size have been described with the largest labeled as nigrosome-1 1.Nigrasome-1Nigrosome-1 within the posterior third of the substantia nigra is able to be visualized on high resolution T2*/SWI weighted MRI. This nigrosome returns high signal on axial SWI in a linear or comma shape. It is surrounded anteriorly, laterally and medially by low SWI signal intensity which resembles the distinctive split tail of a swallow and hence is referred to as the swallow tail appearance. Nigrasome-1 contains the largest proportion of neurons affected in Parkinson's disease, a condition that causes the high SWI signal within nigrosome-1 to be absent. Absence of the normal swallow tail appearance of nigrosome-1 is reported to be a reliable sign of Parkinson's disease 1. There are two main possible mechanisms for this, increased iron content or decreased neuromelanin content with decreased iron storage capacity leading to more free iron with paramagnetic properties 2.

It is most common in West Slavic populations. The role of the NBS1 protein is to arrest the cell cycle in the S phase when there are errors in the cell DNA; and to interact with FANCD2 that can activate the BRCA1/BRCA2 pathway of DNA repair. As a result of a NBS1 defect, there is a higher frequency of malignancies 1. Radiographic featuresCT Patients with NBS carry hypersensitivity to x-radiation and gamma radiation, therefore CT is a relative contraindication.MRIOnly small descriptive series exist on the MRI features in NBS patient 2,3. Features present in all patients were: microcephaly decreased size of frontal lobes and narrow frontal horns of  the lateral ventricles  sinusitis as a result of primary immunodeficiency  Features present in some patients were: agenesis of the posterior part of the corpus callosum colpocephaly temporal horn dilatation Features in a few patients were:callosal hypoplasiaTreatment and prognosisThere is no specific treatment for this syndrome.

On this page:  Article: Epidemiology Clinical presentation Pathology Radiographic features Treatment and prognosis History and etymology Related articles References   EpidemiologyAs the virus is thought to be spread from pigs to humans, pig farmers and abattoir workers are at the highest risk of exposure 2. Several outbreaks of the disease has occurred in Malaysia, Singapore, Bangladesh and India 5.Clinical presentationOn presentation the clinical features ranging from most common to least common include 2: fever headache dizziness vomiting altered level of consciousness focal neurological signs (e.g. cerebellar, segmental myoclonus) respiratory symptoms However, the infection may also be asymptomatic in some patients. PathologyEtiologyNipah virus is a single stranded RNA virus and a member of the paramyxovirus family and the Henipavirus genus. The Henipavirus genus includes two of the most lethal viruses known to man: Hendra and Nipah. The natural reservoir of the virus is the fruit bat 2. The incubation time from exposure to symptom onset is around 9 days 6. However, delayed onset of symptoms has also been reported more than 11 weeks after exposure 2. Most human cases are thought to be related to exposure to porcine hosts which can also be infected with the virus 2. However, direct bat-human transmission and human-human transmission have also been described 5.Microscopic appearanceAutopsies performed on confirmed cases of Nipah showed widespread endothelial damage and vasculitis. Surrounding the vasculitic areas were regions of microinfarction 1,3. The brain is the main organ affected, but the kidneys, heart and lungs also show evidence of viral infection 3.MarkersThe virus is detectable in the CSF through viral culture and nucleic acid amplification. Hendra virus IgM and IgG ELISA tests can also detect Nipah 2.Radiographic featuresCTIn cases of Nipah virus encephalitis, CT is usually unremarkable 3.MRIIn one study, lesions on MRI were seen in 100% of cases of Nipah virus encephalitis 1. Typical appearances include 1,4,7:  T1: hyperintense small discrete lesions, may range in number from 2 to >10  appear round or as strips present in deep white matter cortex (44%), temporal lobe (30%), pons (22%), penducles (10%) 1  may be present as large confluent areas absence of surrounding or generalized edema or mass effect    T1 C+ (Gd): aforementioned lesions are non-enhancing   T2/FLAIR: aforementioned lesions are hyperintense  DWI: lesions have high diffusion signal Treatment and prognosisTreatment is largely supportive, often patients may require ICU admission for ventilation due to respiratory compromise. Antiviral therapy with ribavirin has been trialled, although its benefit is uncertain 2. Public health measures such as pig culling and banning the importation of infected pigs is also important 2.The condition can be rapidly fatal progressing from the onset of symptoms to death on average in 6 days 6. In one study mortality was 32%, whilst 14% had lasting neurological deficit; only 50% experienced complete recovery 2.

There is itching associated with this lesion. Symptoms may show variation with the menstrual cycle. There may enlargement of the nipple and sometimes a mass may be palpated.EpidemiologyCan occur in any age group but most often seen in the age group of 40-50 years. It is seen in both females and males (<5%).PathologyGross pathologyA well circumscribed and unencapsulated lesion.MicroscopicGlands with stromal fibrosis and epithelial hyperplasia.Radiographic featuresMammogramUsually small in size lesions, which are not picked up on ultrasound. If seen they are seen as an indistinct mass in the region of the nipple.UltrasoundMostly seen as a small (0.5 -1.5 cm),  well-circumscribed nodule in the superficial part of the nipple with homogeneous echogenicity. On doppler these lesions are hypervascular. Doppler sonography may also aid in diagnosis since most of these entities are hypervascular. Treatment and prognosisIt is believed to be a premalignant lesion. Complete excision with a narrow rim of uninvolved breast tissue is adequate treatment.Differential diagnosis Paget's disease of the breast ductal adenoma infiltrating syringomatous adenoma of the nipple intraductal papilloma of the breast tubular adenoma 
__label__Breast During the 6th week of gestation, a pair of longitudinal thickening of the epidermis develop on the ventral surface of the embryo, extending from the axilla to the medial thigh, called  "mammary ridges" (or "mammary line", “milk lines"). In large part these milk lines later atrophy, leaving only the part in the pectoral region, where the breasts will develop.The nipple-areolar complex development begins about in the 14th week of gestation, with the differentiation of mesenchymal cells into smooth muscle components.Sometimes may happens that other segments of the ridge, which do not correspond to the breast, remain giving rise to the development of supernumerary nipples most commonly in the axilla or inframammary fold, but they may occur anywhere along the milk line, from the axilla to the groin. This not uncommon condition is called polythelia (similarly may develops accessory mammary glands: this more rare condition is called polymastia).The development of the nipple-areolar complex is followed by the development of special apocrine glands into the Montgomery glands, some large intermediate-stage sebaceous glands that are transitional between sweat glands and mammary glands, capable of secreting milk, that opens at the Morgagni tubercles, which are small  papules on the areola. Pigmentation of the nipple-areolar complex develop between the 32nd and  the 40th week. In adult women the nipple contains the outlets for 15-20 lactiferous ducts arranged cylindrically around the tip. The nipple-areolar complex consists of numerous vessels, intermixed with plain muscular fibers, which are principally arranged in a circular manner around the base, or even radiating from base to apex. The nipple-areolar complex also contains many sensory nerve endings, smooth muscle, and an abundant lymphatic system called subareolar plexus or Sappey's plexus. Nipple-areolar anatomy is remarkably variable in dimension, texture, and color across ethnic groups and among individuals.The physiological purpose of nipple-areolar complex is to deliver milk produced by the mammary glands during lactation.
__label__Breast Nipple inversion is an important finding on mammography and correlation with patient history is essential. When nipple abnormalities such as inversion are identified, it is important for the technologist to document them in the medical record / mammography worksheet so that the radiologist will be aware of the findings.In most cases, nipple inversion results from a benign process that takes place gradually over a long period of time. It may be bilateral or unilateral. In cases of unilateral inversion that develops more rapidly (e.g. within a few months), the cause is more likely to be a malignancy, although a number of benign entities have also been associated with a rapidly developing nipple inversion, including: mammary duct ectasia postsurgical scarring fat necrosis fibrocystic change Mondor disease Radiographic featuresIn cases where history is non-contributory or unavailable, or when inversion has developed rapidly, additional mammographic work-up is needed, including: spot compression views with the nipple in profile (to determine the presence of a retroareolar mass)  craniocaudal and lateral spot magnification views to assess for microcalcifications  If the mammographic views are unrevealing, ultrasound should be performed.
__label__Chest __label__Breast Nipple markers can be a useful technique in the evaluation of small radiodensities overlying the expected position of the nipple on a chest radiograph. Not uncommonly a small round opacity projects over the lower thorax on a chest radiograph (see: solitary pulmonary nodule).Often, especially in women, this is a nipple shadow - a dense nipple projected over the lung. However, one must be cautious that this is not pathology - in particular, a low-grade lung malignancy (with potential surgical cure).If in doubt, recall the patient and repeat the study with nipple markers. These can be small ball-bearings, paperclips reformed in triangle shapes around the nipple or other radiopaque markers, which are stuck to the chest with the nipple within or with the marker directly on the nipple. Markers are usually placed on both sides of the chest, even though the concern is usually on one side only.On the repeat film: if the nodule is inside the marker, it is a nipple  If the nodule is outside the marker, it is something besides a nipple (potentially cancer); work-up including CT chest is indicated 
__label__Chest Nipple shadows refer to the silhouettes of the nipples on frontal chest radiographs, which may mimic solitary pulmonary nodules (SPNs). On this page:  Article: Epidemiology Pathology Radiographic features Differential diagnosis Related articles References   Images:Cases and figures  EpidemiologyNipple shadows are apparent on ~7.5% (range 3.5-11%) of frontal chest x-rays 1.PathologyIt has been proposed by Miller et al. that solitary pulmonary nodules that reach some or all of the following criteria be considered nipple shadows 2: bilateral and symmetric "fuzzy" margins or radiolucent "halo" sharp lateral border and poorly defined medial border (may be present only on PA projections 3) nodules are in a characteristic position: male: between the 5th and 6th ribs anteriorly female: at the inferior aspect of the breast shadow    were not present on a very recent film prominent nipples may be visible on a lateral projection However, if there is doubt whether a nodular opacity represents a nipple shadow or not, a repeat chest x-ray with nipple markers should be performed 4, albeit at a financial cost and further radiation dose to the patient.There is always the rare occurrence of a real solitary pulmonary nodule being overshadowed by a nipple shadow.Radiographic featuresPlain radiographOn chest radiograph the following features are present: nipple shadows are nodular opacities that are consistent in shape, size and position 1,2: oval or round 5-15 mm in diameter between the 9th and 10th ribs posteriorly or the 5th and 6th ribs anteriorly   tend to have incomplete margins due to their attachment to the chest wall 4  Differential diagnosis  solitary pulmonary nodulecoin lesion  pleural or extrapleural lesions 3  
__label__Chest Nitrofurantoin related lung disease refers to a spectrum of lung changes that can be precipitated by nitrofurantoin use. Nitrofurantoin can induce both an acute hypersensitivity reaction (occurring around 1-2 week after a short course) or chronic pulmonary reaction (occurring after months to years of exposure) 4.   Nitrofurantoin-induced lung injury is uncommon where a considerable number of reported publications likely reflect the widespread use of the drug rather than the incidence of the complication 7.Severe lung changes have been described inclusive of  nitrofurantoin-induced granulomatous interstitial pneumonia 2   nitrofurantoin associated giant cell interstitial pneumonia 3  Radiographic featuresCT chestSeveral CT patterns may be observed which include 5  organizing pneumonia - pattern  hypersensitivity pneumonitis - pattern  non-specific interstitial pneumonitis (NSIP) - pattern: considered most common pattern of "chronic" lung change 7   usual interstitial pneumonitis (UIP) pattern See alsodrug induced lung disease 
__label__Central __label__Nervous __label__System __label__Spine Nitrous oxide (N2O) toxicity has serious medical sequelae affecting both the CNS and the bone marrow. Neurological effects include encephalopathy, myelopathy, and neuropathy. This results from demyelination and gliosis due to selective inhibition of vitamin B12 1. Bone marrow toxicity may lead to myelosuppression, including neutropenia and megaloblastic anemia.N2O is an established and widely used anesthetic gas though also misused quite commonly for recreational purposes as a legal 'high'. Canisters of nitrous oxide, colloquially known as “whippets”, "nangs", or "bulbs" 5, are used commercially as a propellant for whipped cream, and are commonly abused 6. On this page:  Article: Epidemiology Clinical presentation Pathology Radiographic features Treatment and prognosis History and etymology Differential diagnosis Related articles References   Images:Cases and figures  EpidemiologyAs an end user, nitrous oxide gas is a close-to-ideal recreational agent, it is legal, inexpensive, easily accessible, and not found on standard illicit substance screens. Physiologically, its effects manifest within seconds of inspiring the gas, and its offset is just as rapid, with no after effects, such that users may continue with their regular activities only minutes post-exposure.In the 2013/14 Crime Survey for England and Wales, it was reported that almost 8% 16 to 24 year olds had used nitrous oxide recreationally in the previous 12 months 8.Pre-existing vitamin B12 deficiency increases risk of nitrous oxide induced toxicity 8.Clinical presentationThe classic neurological appearance of vitamin B12 deficiency is the so-called subacute combined degeneration of the cord manifested as damage to the dorsal columns of the spinal cord, responsible for the transmission of vibratory and proprioceptive input. Peripheral neuropathy, optic atrophy, and dementia can also occur.PathologyNeurotoxicity is secondary to the selective inhibition of vitamin B12 (hydroxocobalamin), which serves as a cofactor for methionine synthase, which is an enzyme active in folate metabolism and the formation of myelin sheath phospholipids 2,4.The end result of overexposure is demyelination and eventual gliosis, both within the central nervous system and to a lesser extent the peripheral nervous system. Radiographic featuresRadiographic features are identical to those of subacute combined degeneration of the cord.MRI T2: thoracic hyperintense signal involving the dorsal columns (inverted "V" sign), although less commonly lateral tracts of the spinal cord may also be affected; very rarely is there involvement of the anterior spinal cordTreatment and prognosisTreatment options include: halting exposure to nitrous oxide high dose of intramuscular vitamin B12, followed by oral supplementation methionine supplementation has also been used 2  PrognosisDespite optimal treatment some patients are left with a permanent deficit, including lifelong paraparesis.Although there is no risk of physical addiction, the risk of a psychological N2O habit is a clear and present danger 8.History and etymologyNitrous oxide gas was first synthesized in 1772 by an English theologian and chemist, Joseph Priestly, chiefly remembered historically for his discovery of oxygen. Within only a few years it was already being abused as a recreational 'high', aware of this Humphrey Davy coined the term "laughing gas" 7,8. By 1844, Horace Wells, an American dentist, had reported its usefulness as an anesthetic gas.Differential diagnosisOn imaging, the differential diagnosis includes:  other etiologies of subacute combined degeneration of the cord   copper deficiency myeloneuropathy: can look identical  ​vitamin E deficiency: can look identical  demyelination  multiple sclerosis: also affects dorsal columns but usually over a shorter length  transverse myelitis: although longer length, usually not restricted to dorsal columns   infectious causes  HIV vacuolar myelopathy: may appear very similar herpes viruses myelitis  neurosyphilis (tabes dorsalis)   inflammatory processessarcoidosis  ischemia neoplasms  astrocytoma: not particularly of dorsal columns. usually, more cord expansion; often enhance  ependymoma: not particularly of dorsal columns. usually, more cord expansion; often enhance   hereditary syndromes  leukoencephalopathy with brainstem and spinal cord involvement and lactate elevation: characteristically also involves the cerebral white matter and the brainstem  Friedreich ataxia: also causes cervical cord atrophy ('thinning')

The infection is acquired primarily by inhalation of the bacillus from the environment, from where it can spread hematogenously to other organs and tissues 1-2. In the CNS the infection manifests as meningitis, granuloma with giant cells or cerebral abscesses 2. Identification of Nocardia spp. in the clinical laboratory can be challenging: the organism may grow on cultures in intervals between 4 days to 2–4 weeks 1.Radiographic featuresThis infection has no specific features to aid in suggesting the diagnosis. It typically manifests as a parenchymal abscess in any part of the brain, though spinal cord abscesses and meningitis have also been described 1,2.Treatment and prognosisMedical and surgical opinions should be sought 4,5. Empiric antibiotic treatment consists of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole plus either a carbapenem class antibiotic and/or amikacin 4, while surgical management includes craniotomy or aspiration of abscesses 4,5.

__label__Musculoskeletal Nodular fasciitis is a rapidly growing non-neoplastic soft tissue lesion that is frequently located in the deep subcutaneous region or in the fascia. The most common locations for nodular fasciitis are the volar aspect of the forearm, the lower extremity, and the chest and back. It typically manifests as a rapidly growing mass. On this page:  Article: Epidemiology Clinical presentation Pathology Radiographic features Treatment and prognosis Differential diagnosis References   Images:Cases and figures  EpidemiologyMost often, nodular fasciitis occurs in patients between 20 and 40 years of age, but children also may be affected.Clinical presentationIn many cases (~45%), it is localized to the upper extremity, particularly the volar aspect of the forearm. Other common sites are: trunk (20%) head and neck (18%) lower extremities (16%) Symptoms of tenderness and pain are frequently described at presentation.PathologyThe pathogenesis of nodular fasciitis is poorly understood. Some describe it as a reactive lesion related to trauma, others have described chromosomal abnormalities that are suggestive of a neoplastic origin.LocationThree general subtypes of nodular fasciitis may be identified on the basis of the lesion location: subcutaneous intramuscular fascial Most occurrences of nodular fasciitis are subcutaneous, fascia based, and circumscribed; these lesions may be amenable to biopsy or excision without any need for imaging evaluation. ClassificationThe entity is included in the WHO classification of soft tissue tumors under "fibroblastic/myofibroblastic tumors."Microscopic appearanceBenign proliferation of fibroblasts and myofibroblasts, typically mistaken for a sarcomatous lesion because of its rapid growth, abundant spindle-shaped cells, and mitotic activity.Radiographic featuresThe lesions tend to be small (<4 cm). UltrasoundSonography can show one or more well-defined isoechoic to hypoechoic nodules with a mildly increased vascular flow in the deep portion of the subcutaneous fat layer, adjacent to or in the fascia.MRINodular fasciitis may be categorized as myxoid, cellular, or fibrous. This histologic diversity likely accounts for the variable MR imaging appearance of the lesions: hypercellular lesions appear nearly isointense to that in skeletal muscle on T1WI and hyperintense to that in adipose tissue on T2WI highly collagenous lesions have hypointense signal on all sequences contrast enhancement is typically diffuse but may be peripheral Treatment and prognosisThe imaging-based diagnosis should be verified with an excisional biopsy.Treatment typically consists of marginal excision of the lesion(s). Several weeks of observation (after a diagnosis based on the results of percutaneous fine-needle biopsy) also have been advocated given the self-limited course of the disease.Spontaneous regression and involution of lesions in response to steroid injections have been reported ref required. Differential diagnosisImaging differential considerations include: Dupuytren's disease (palmar fibromatosis) extra-abdominal desmoid tumor  neurofibroma fibrous histiocytoma soft tissue sarcoma if intramuscular early myositis ossificans may be considered

__label__Cardiac Non-compaction of the left ventricle, also known as spongiform cardiomyopathy or left ventricular non-compaction (LVNC) is a phenotype of hypertrophic ventricular trabeculations and deep interventricular recesses. It has been hypothesized to result from arrest of normal myocardial compaction during embryogenesis, although acquired cases have also been reported.Non-compaction of the right ventricle has been described but is rare 3. On this page:  Article: Terminology Clinical presentation Pathology Radiographic features Treatment and prognosis Differential diagnosis References   Images:Cases and figures  TerminologyThere is controversy as to whether non-compaction of the left ventricle represents a distinct disease versus a phenotypic manifestation of various cardiomyopathies 9. For example, although LVNC is classified as a primary genetic cardiomyopathy by the American Heart Association, it remains unclassified by both the World Health Organization and the European Society of Cardiology 9.At least some of the inconsistency is due to the fact that non-compaction of the left ventricle is mostly diagnosed by morphological criteria on non-invasive imaging (e.g. echocardiography and cardiac MRI), and no universally accepted criteria exist.Additionally, findings of non-compaction of the left ventricle may be seen in a spectrum of clinical presentations. It may be seen as a component of cardiomyopathy, such as in Barth syndrome, or in concert with other myocardial structural/functional abnormalities (e.g. dilated, restrictive, arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathies); however, it may be acquired/reversible and/or observed in subjects with normal left ventricular function and size.Thus, findings of LVNC should not be equated with cardiomyopathy or aberrant left ventricular function, as the findings should be integrated into a holistic evaluation of cardiac function in deciding a final diagnosis 6.Clinical presentationWhile non-compaction of the left ventricle may be an isolated morphological variant, discovered in patients with otherwise structurally and functionally normal hearts, it may also present as a component of a congenital heart disease or true cardiomyopathy; in this latter instance, it may present as congestive heart failure. Other presenting features may include 8: exertional syncopemay be associated with a long QT intervalmay predispose to a subtype of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia, torsades de pointes   atrial fibrillation systemic thromboembolic eventsmay lead to transient ischemic attacks or stroke   PathologyAssociationsIn most patients with non-compaction of the left ventricle, there are no other cardiac malformations. Both familial and sporadic forms have been described 1. However, in at least one study, approximately 12% of patients had associated cardiac malformations 1:  ventricular outflow tract / left ventricular outflow tract abnormalities (46%, mainly bicuspid aortic valve)  Ebstein anomaly (25%) more rarely: tetralogy of Fallot or coarctation of the aorta  Radiographic featuresPlain radiographChest radiographs are not useful in the diagnosis of non-compaction of the left ventricle. They are more useful in identifying complications of the cardiomyopathy, such as pulmonary edema and cardiomegaly.EchocardiographyEchocardiography was traditionally used in the diagnosis of left ventricular non-compaction, with the addition of contrast greatly increasing the sensitivity of this examination. However, cardiac MRI is now considered the modality of choice to make this diagnosis. There are no universally accepted echocardiographic criteria for left ventricular non-compaction. Most common echocardiographic features include 7: bilayered mural appearance of the left ventricle the relatively hypoechoic inner layer of the left ventricular wall representing the endocardium/myocardium is hypertrabeculatedreferred to as the non-compacted or "NC" layer  the non-compacted layer is surrounded by the outer "compacted" layer, representing the epicardium classical definition based on the NC/C thickness ratioincreased thickness of the NC layer with an NC/C ratio >2.3 consistent with the diagnosis    regional increase in left ventricular trabeculation predominantly affects the inferolateral walls and the apex   parasternal short axis (or apical four/two/long-axis view) should reveal at least four trabeculations   pronounced intertrabecular "crypts" or recessescontinuity with the left ventricular cavity may be demonstrated by color flow Doppler   Other commonly associated features include: left ventricular dysfunctionboth systolic and diastolic   intraventricular thrombus  left atrial enlargementassociated with atrial fibrillation   MRICardiac MRI (CMR) has a better contrast resolution than echocardiography and it is the modality of choice for the diagnosis of spongiform cardiomyopathy. The best diagnostic clue is a ratio of non-compacted telediastolic myocardium to compacted telediastolic myocardium of more than 2.3:1 (sensitivity: 86%, specificity: 99%).Treatment and prognosisThe only definitive treatment of left ventricular non-compaction is cardiac transplantation. Otherwise, prevention of both heart failure and thromboembolic events are the main target of treatments.Differential diagnosisPossible differential considerations in certain situations include:  cardiomyopathies dilated cardiomyopathy hypertrophic cardiomyopathy restrictive cardiomyopathy arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy    normal variantathletes heart  congenital heart disease 
__label__Head __label__& __label__Neck __label__Paediatrics Non-decussating retinal-fugal fiber syndrome (NRFFS), also referred to as achiasma, is the isolated congenital absence of optic chiasm with unremarkable rest of the optic pathway and midline structures. Clinically, it typically presents as seesaw nystagmus since childhood. Diagnosis is usually made out by MRI which shows an isolated absence of optic chiasm. It is important for radiologists to be aware of this entity as the pathology may be overlooked if only thick sections are evaluated and attention is not paid to the optic pathway. On this page:  Article: Epidemiology Clinical presentation Pathology Radiographic features Treatment and prognosis History and etymology  References   EpidemiologyNRFFS is a rare cause of congenital nystagmus. Achiasma or hypochiasma has been reported in patients with congenital anophthalmos, midline anomalies like septo-optic dysplasia and in patients with albinism. However, the isolated absence of optic chiasm is rare, with only a few cases reported previously.Clinical presentationClinically congenital seesaw nystagmus, ‘mirror reversal’ of visual field representation and interocular ipsilateral asymmetry on monocular VEP point toward achiasma and warrant further evaluation with MRI. Seesaw nystagmus is a characteristic, vertical-torsional eye movement disorder wherein there is intorsion and elevation of one eye and simultaneous extortion and depression of another eye. It could have either pendular waveform (due to midline bilaterally compressing meso-diencephalic mass) or jerk-waveform (due to unilateral lesion).PathologyIt is a congenital disorder characterized by failure of the crossing of optic nerve fibers at the optic chiasm.Radiographic featuresMRIMRI is the investigation of choice to evaluate a patient suspected to have achiasma. Typical imaging findings include optic nerves transitioning into optic tracts without normal optic chiasm. No other midline abnormalities are noted. Thin sections or a three-dimensional sequence may be of great help. Functional MRI confirms electrophysiology observations of crossed asymmetry with each visual cortex receiving complete but monocular visual field.Treatment and prognosisTreatment includes correction of strabismus that usually accompanies. In spite of such large functional abnormalities, vision is typically preserved in most regards because of the reorganization of intracortical connections. History and etymology The condition was first described in the early 1990s in Belgian sheep dogs by Williams et al.

__label__Obstetrics Non-invasive perinatal testing (NIPT) is an antenatal screening technique which has relatively recently come into practice.  It relies on the detection of small amounts of cell free fetal DNA to be detected in the maternal bloodstream, hence allowing prenatal genetic diagnosis to occur by way of a maternal blood test. Pathogenetic basisApproximately 10% of cell free DNA in the maternal blood stream is cell free fetal DNA (cffDNA) - in fact representing DNA from the cytotrophoblast of the placenta. In the setting of a fetal trisomy such as Trisomy 21, current technologies can accurately detect the small relative increase in the number of chromosomal fragments related to the particular chromosome (e.g. chromosome 21 for Down syndrome) with a high degree of accuracy.See also antenatal screening  aneuploidy trisomy 21 trisomy 18 trisomy 13    
__label__Central __label__Nervous __label__System Non-ketotic hyperglycemic hemichorea (NHH), also known as diabetic striatopathy or chorea, hyperglycemia, basal ganglia (C-H-BG) syndrome, is a rare neurological complication of non-ketotic hyperglycemia, along with non-ketotic hyperosmolar coma and non-ketotic hyperglycemic seizures. It is a cause of hemichorea-hemiballismus syndrome. On this page:  Article: Epidemiology Clinical presentation Pathology Radiographic features Treatment and prognosis Differential diagnosis See also References   Images: Cases and figures Imaging differential diagnosis   EpidemiologyNon-ketotic hyperglycemic hemichorea is most frequently reported in elderly patients, typically Asian, who have type 2 diabetes mellitus, although this may represent publication bias 2. The majority of cases published involved female patients 4.Clinical presentationChorea and ballismus develops rapidly and can be either unilateral or bilateral and is seen during episodes of non-ketotic hyperglycemia. Symptoms usually resolve upon normalization of glucose levels. PathologyThe exact underlying pathophysiology of changes seen on imaging of patients with non-ketotic hyperglycemic hemichorea is not fully understood 1,2. Some hypothesized mechanisms include 5:  hyperviscosity secondary to hyperglycemia, leading to regional blood-brain barrier disruption and metabolic damage the augmented sensitivity of dopaminergic receptors in a postmenopausal period (possibly explaining the female predominance in reported case series) decreased gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) availability in the striatum secondary to the non-ketotic state Radiographic featuresCTCT of the brain initially is normal, but later it can demonstrate subtle hyperdensity in the striatal region (caudate nuclei and putamen) 2,7. Findings tend to be contralateral to the body side affected by hemiballistic, hemichoreic movements. MRIMRI of the brain is the modality of choice for assessing possible non-ketotic hyperglycemic hemichorea and typically demonstrates signal changes particularly in the putamen and/or caudate 1-3. If the changes are unilateral, then they are contralateral to the symptomatic side 2.   T1: hyperintense  T2/FLAIR: variable but generally hypointense   DWI: high diffusion signal Overall, the T1 hyperintensity is the most consistent finding of the disease. Other associated findings do not present to the same frequency and tend to vary 6.Imaging findings gradually resolve after hyperglycemia correction. However, they tend to return to baseline more slowly than the clinical findings 3.Treatment and prognosisSymptoms and imaging findings usually resolve upon normalization of glucose levels 7, and there is no need for specific management. Differential diagnosisThe main MRI differential is that of other causes of increased T1 signal in the basal ganglia (including Wilson disease) and of a striatocapsular infarct 6. Some causes of striatal hyperdensity on CT include 6: hypertensive hemorrhages basal ganglia calcifications Tay Sachs disease tuberous sclerosis See alsohemichorea-hemiballismus syndrome
__label__Central __label__Nervous __label__System Non-ketotic hyperglycemic seizures are one of the neurological complications of non-ketotic hyperglycemia, along with non-ketotic hyperosmolar coma and non-ketotic hyperglycemic hemichorea.  On this page:  Article: Epidemiology Clinical presentation Pathology Radiographic features Treatment and prognosis References   Images:Cases and figures  EpidemiologySeizures in the context of non-ketotic hyperglycemia are most frequently reported in middle-aged to elderly patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, with one relatively large study reporting an average age of 61 years without any significant gender predilection 1. It has been reported that up to 25% of patients with non-ketotic hyperglycemia develop seizures 1. Interestingly, seizures are comparatively very rare in ketotic hyperglycemia (or diabetic ketoacidosis) 1.Clinical presentationSeizures are seen in the early stages of non-ketotic hyperglycemia, usually, days before coma manifests 1-5. Most commonly the seizures are focal motor seizures, with a temporal lobe focus, and are often recurrent (epilepsia partialis continua or partial status epilepticus), however focal seizures with an occipital lobe focus have also been reported 1-5. Symptoms usually resolve upon normalization of glucose levels 1-5. PathologyThe exact underlying pathophysiology of seizures in non-ketotic hyperglycemia remains unclear 4. Although there are many hypotheses, it is likely that the pathogenesis is multi-factorial, considering 4: an acidic pH is required for gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) synthesis from glutamic acid, and because ketoacidosis does not occur in non-ketotic hyperglycemia there theoretically could be a decrease in GABA 4  patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, and thus at risk of developing non-ketotic hyperglycemia, are more likely to have underlying structural and vascular anomalies which may contribute to a higher risk of seizures 4  patients are often hyponatremic at presentation which is a known risk factor for developing seizures 4  Radiographic featuresCTCT of the brain is often normal throughout the presentation, however, regions of decreased density have been reported rarely in the literature 1. MRIMRI of the brain is the modality of choice for assessing possible non-ketotic hyperglycemic seizures and demonstrates many features at the epileptogenic focus which would otherwise be atypical and unexpected for a patient with seizures:  T1: often no anomaly 6-9   T2/FLAIR: subcortical regions of hypointensity 6-9   DWI: often no anomaly 6-9   T1 C+ (Gd): leptomeningeal enhancement has been reported in at least one study 9  Imaging findings gradually resolve after glycemia correction, however the evolution of mild atrophy in the region of the epileptogenic focus has been reported 6. This is in stark contrast to classical expected MR findings of seizures (see status epilepticus), which include regions of T2-weighted hyperintensity and high diffusion signal on DWI, without any significant long-term sequelae 6,10,11.It is unclear exactly why there is this difference between the imaging features of non-ketotic hyperglycemic seizures and other seizures, however it has been postulated that perhaps excitotoxic cell damage due to seizure-related excessive synaptic activity in patients with non-ketotic hyperglycemia may unusually result in the development of excessive free radicals (including iron) which may contribute to cerebral subcortical injury, a process that does not occur without hyperglycemia 6-8.Treatment and prognosisManagement is through normalization of glucose levels 12.

__label__Breast Non-mass enhancement at breast MRI is defined in the BI-RADS lexicon as an area of enhancement that does not meet criteria for a mass, such as by having nonconvex borders or intervening fat or fibroglandular tissue between the enhancing components. On this page:  Article: Pathology Radiographic appearance Treatment and prognosis Differential diagnosis Practical points References   PathologyEtiologyA wide variety of benign, high risk and malignant processes can manifest as non-mass enhancement 2,6: fibrocystic changes pseudoangiomatous stromal hyperplasia (PASH) apocrine metaplasia  radiation therapy effect flat epithelial atypia atypical ductal hyperplasia radial scar/complex sclerosing lesion intraductal papilloma ductal carcinoma in situ invasive carcinoma of no special type (ductal carcinoma not otherwise specified) invasive lobular carcinoma Radiographic appearanceMRIThe BI-RADS lexicon (5th edition) provides standard descriptors for the distribution and internal pattern of non-mass contrast enhancement 1. distribution focal: confined area less than a breast quadrant characterized by a non-mass internal enhancement pattern linear: straight, curved, or branching arrangement of enhancement, suggestive of ductal or periductal involvement segmental: triangular or conical arrangement with the apex directed toward the nipple, suggestive of ductal or periductal involvement regional: area larger than a breast quadrant multiple regions: more than one large area, separated by normal tissue, not conforming to a ductal distribution (patchy) diffuse: randomly arranged throughout the breast   internal enhancement patterns homogeneous: confluent and uniform heterogeneous: randomly separated by normal tissue in a nonuniform pattern clumped: small aggregates of enhancement ("cobblestone" like)  in various sizes and shapes, suggestive of ductal involvement; used in combination with focal, linear, segmental, or regional distribution clustered ring: multiple small ring shapes closely arranged, suggestive of periductal involvement   Treatment and prognosisIn general, a substantial minority of non-mass enhancement proves to be malignant 3-5. Second-look breast ultrasound is prudent to look for a correlate that can be targeted for ultrasound-guided rather than MRI-guided breast biopsy.Differential diagnosisAlternative considerations for describing an enhancing area depends on the size, shape, and distinctness from the rest of the breast parenchyma: focus background parenchymal enhancement mass Practical pointsNon-mass enhancement is usually assessed as suspicious and managed with core needle biopsy (BI-RADS 4). There are limited data supporting a probably benign assessment for certain types of non-mass enhancement (BI-RADS 3), which remains a matter of intuition for most radiologists 1. In one newer study, a linear distribution of non-mass enhancement <1 cm that is not branching is probably benign 7. Anecdotal experience suggests homogeneous non-mass enhancement in a focal, regional, or multiple regions distribution on baseline examination may also fit this category 8,9.In some clinical situations, enhancement could be transient and related to hormonal status. For instance, a premenopausal patient may be scanned in a suboptimal part of her cycle, or a postmenopausal patient may be taking hormone replacement therapy. If this is suspected but the finding is not clearly background parenchymal enhancement, the non-mass enhancement may be assessed as probably benign (BI-RADS 3) with a recommendation for a very short interval follow up (2-3 months), timed for week 2 of the patient's cycle or after suspending hormonal therapy 1.
__label__Breast A non-mass finding on breast ultrasound refers to a discrete region of altered breast parenchymal echotexture that does make a mass shape (i.e. non-identifiable in two planes).

It most commonly affects patients >50 years 3. PathologyNon-occlusive mesenteric ischemia occurs without arterial or venous occlusion in the region of bowel ischemia/infarction 1. EtiologySystemic hypoperfusion from numerous causes 2,3: cardiac disease (e.g. myocardial infarction) systemic hypotension (e.g. cardiogenic, septic, or hemorrhagic shock) resulting in shock bowel  blunt abdominal trauma hypotension following dialysis  cardiac or major abdominal surgery Medication-induced mesenteric vasospasm (e.g. vasoconstriction from digitalis, amphetamines, cocaine, vasopressin) can also be a cause 2.Radiographic featuresCTFeatures of bowel ischemia may be present and the affected bowel may be in watershed areas. CT angiography can show mesenteric arterial narrowing and reduced superior mesenteric artery caliber 2-4. Features of CT hypoperfusion complex may also be present and evaluation of extra-intestinal viscera is important 2. 
__label__Musculoskeletal __label__Paediatrics Non-ossifying fibromas (NOF) are the most common type of non-neoplastic fibrous bone lesion and are a larger version (>3 cm) of a fibrous cortical defect; both are encompassed by the term fibroxanthoma or metaphyseal fibrous defect. On this page:  Article: Epidemiology Clinical presentation Pathology Radiographic features Treatment and prognosis Differential diagnosis See also Related articles References   Images: Cases and figures Imaging differential diagnosis   EpidemiologyNOFs are very common in children and adolescents, and the most common fibrous, bony lesion in this age group 6, with a peak incidence at 10-15 years of age. The prevalence is estimated at 30-40% of all normal children. It is twice as common in boys than in girls 8. They are usually not seen beyond the age of 30, as they spontaneously heal, being gradually filled in by bone.Clinical presentationThe majority of NOFs are asymptomatic. Larger lesions may be painful and potentially weaken the bone enough to predispose to pathological fracture.Multiple NOFs are associated with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) and Jaffe-Campanacci syndrome. Rarely fibroxanthomas can cause hypophosphatemic vitamin D-resistant rickets 7.PathologyNOF appears macroscopically as a fleshy, fibrous, yellow or tan-brown lesion with variable areas of hemorrhage 4.Microscopic examination reveals the lesions to be highly cellular containing spindle-shaped cells on a background of stromal tissue in a prominent storiform pattern. Foamy histiocytes and multinucleated giant cells are also seen. Mitotic figures and/or cellular dysplasia should not be seen 4.The irony of non-ossifying fibromas appearing to ossify has not been lost on generations of radiologists, although strictly speaking the lesion itself does not ossify, rather being filled in by normal bone from the periphery 4. Indeed, it is believed that many bone islands are healed fibroxanthomas (FCD/NOF).Radiographic featuresPlain radiograph / CTNOFs are typically a multiloculated lucent lesion with a sclerotic rim.  They are located eccentrically in the metaphysis, adjacent to the physis. As the patient ages, they seem to migrate away from the physis 9.They have no associated periosteal reaction, cortical breach or associated soft tissue mass.MRIMR appearances are variable and depend on when along with the development and healing phase the lesion is imaged.Initially, the lesion has a high or intermediate T2 signal, with a peripheral low signal rim corresponding to the sclerotic border. As it matures and begins to ossify, the signal becomes low on all sequences 3.Contrast enhancement is also variable 1.Nuclear medicineAppearance on bone scan depends on the phase of the lesion: NOF usually not associated with increased activity mild to moderately increased activity can be seen during NOF "healing", corresponding to mild hyperemia and osteoblastic activitynote that extensive uptake or hyperemia should prompt consideration of alternative diagnosis or a superimposed fracture 4   Treatment and prognosisNon-ossifying fibroma is one of the skeletal “Don’t touch” lesions.Most NOFs require no treatment and no biopsy. If large (involving more than 50% of the diameter of the parent bone) then prophylactic curettage and bone grafting may be prudent to avoid a pathological fracture 1.Differential diagnosisGeneral imaging differential considerations include: fibrous cortical defect  aneurysmal bone cyst  eccentric lytic metaphyseal lesion MR differentiates ABC by fluid-fluid levels   chondromyxoid fibroma fibrous dysplasia desmoplastic fibroma See also ossifying fibroma pathological fracture 
__label__Breast With increasing use of screening mammography and ultrasound for various indications, a large number of non-palpable breast lesions are being detected.Among this large number of non-palpable masses, not all are malignant. The incidence of malignancy among these non-palpable lesions varies between 20-30%.The radiologist plays an important role in the further work up and management of this subset of patients.Radiologists roleWhat role can we as radiologists play? be careful in evaluating any breast lesion; comparison with previous images is invaluable; lesions that change over time is a significant finding but is not necessarily a predictor of malignancy. be sure not to overdiagnose rule out pseudo mass lesions; if necessary, perform extra views in mammography like magnification views use ultrasound to correlate the abnormal findings on mammography. can perform wire needle localization of non-palpable lesions detected by mammography which are not seen on ultrasound can use same procedure of stereotactic biopsy to place a hook wire in the center of the lesion following the excision, can do specimen mammography to ensure that there is an adequate margin by comparing the specimen mammogram with the preoperative mammograms the suspicious lesion may be just a cluster of microcalcifications in such cases, we need to be careful evaluating adequate margins on specimen mammogram in lesions seen on mammography, needle placement can be done under sonographic guidance. In such cases, intraoperative sonography can be performed to assess complete removal ultrasound-guided FNAC/biopsy can be performed preoperatively. recent technique of radionuclide localization (ROLL) is emerging as an adjunct. Triple assessmentTo be convinced a lesion is benign, the lesion has to always be benign/innocuous on clinical exam breast imaging, i.e. mammography, ultrasound and or MRI or a combination of each tissue sampling (cytology or histology) If one of the three bullets above is not satisfied, the lesion cannot simply be called benign. If the lesion is clinically suspicious and even if imaging is negative, cytology is indicated. If the lesion is palpable and not seen on mammogram ultrasound is mandatory and unless the ultrasound is convincingly benign, tissue sampling is indicated.
__label__Oncology __label__Urogenital Non-seminomatous germ cell tumors (NSGCTs) are one of the main groups of germ cell tumors (the other being seminoma). Although they are made up of distinct histological entities, in general, they have similar radiographic appearances. They can, however, be found widely in the body, with variable imaging features, pathology, treatment and prognosis. As such they are discussed separately.This article focuses on a general discussion of non-seminomatous germ cell tumors, as well as providing a structure to individual articles. On this page:  Article: Epidemiology Clinical presentation Pathology Radiographic features Treatment and prognosis Related articles References   Images:Cases and figures  EpidemiologyThey occur in younger patients than seminoma, with a peak incidence in late teens to twenties. They are the most common primary testicular malignancy, accounting for ~60% of cases.Some consider testicular microlithiasis to be a risk factor for germ-cell tumors, although this is controversial.Clinical presentationThey tend to be more aggressive than seminomas, and frequently metastasize.Serological markersApproximately 70% of non-seminomatous germ cell tumors produce hormonal markers (tumor markers):  alpha-fetoprotein (AFP): typically elevated in yolk sac tumor  beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (B-hCG): typically elevated in choriocarcinoma lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) PathologyNon-seminomatous germ cell tumors can be divided histologically into:  embryonal cell carcinoma: rare  choriocarcinoma: rare (carries worst prognosis) yolk sac tumor  teratoma: accounts for 5-10% of germ cell tumors mature immature teratoma with malignant transformation    mixed germ cell tumor is the most common type of NSGCT accounts for 40% of all germ cell tumors  the most common combination is teratoma and embryonal cell carcinoma    See: classification of germ cell tumors.Radiographic featuresIn contrast to seminomas, non-seminomatous germ cell tumors tend to be more heterogeneous on ultrasound and on T2-weighted MR images with frequent cystic areas or calcification. They tend to be more aggressive than seminomas and tunica invasion is common. The appearance of an individual tumor will, of course, vary depending on the location. Please refer to the parent article germ cell tumors for links to specific locations.Imaging is also essential for the staging of non-seminomatous germ cell tumors which is location dependent. See: testicular cancer staging.Treatment and prognosisThe prognosis of non-seminomatous germ cell tumors is variable and depends on the biological behavior of individual tumors. Prognosis can be inferred from tumor markers, the location of the primary tumor and the presence of metastases 4. good prognosis (all of the following must be true) tumor markers alpha-fetoprotein <1000 ng/mL beta HCG <5000 IU/L LDH <1.5x upper limit of normal   non-mediastinal location of the primary tumor no nonpulmonary metastases  These patients are usually treated with orchiectomy followed by chemotherapy (bleomycin, etoposide and cisplatin - BEP regimen).  intermediate prognosis (all of the following must be true) tumor markers alpha-fetoprotein: 1000-10,000 ng/mL beta-hCG: 5000-50,000 IU/L LDH: 1.5-10x upper limit of normal   non-mediastinal location of the primary tumor no nonpulmonary metastases  These patients are started with chemotherapy cycles and sometimes followed by adjuvant surgery.  poor prognosis (any of the following): tumor markers alpha-fetoprotein: >10,000 ng/mL beta-hCG: >50,000 IU/L LDH: >10x upper limit of normal   mediastinal primary tumor nonpulmonary metastases present   Considering a poor prognosis, surgery is usually precluded, and patients are followed with aggressive chemotherapy.

__label__Chest Non-specific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP) is the second most common morphological and pathological pattern of interstitial lung diseases. NSIP has two main subtypes:  fibrotic type: most common, having a more dismal outcome  cellular type: less common, but carries a much better prognosis due to a very good response to the treatments On imaging, the most common features are relatively symmetric and bilateral ground-glass opacities with associated fine reticulations and pulmonary volume loss resulting in traction bronchiectasis. Immediate subpleural sparing, when present is considered very specific for NSIP. On this page:  Article: Epidemiology Clinical presentation Pathology Radiographic features Treatment and prognosis History and etymology Differential diagnosis Practical points Related articles References   Images: Cases and figures Imaging differential diagnosis   EpidemiologyNon-specific interstitial pneumonia typically tends to present in middle-aged adults, 40-50 years of age 1. It may be common in Caucasian-European populations 9. Overall prevalence is higher in women due to high association with collagen vascular diseases, but the prevalence of idiopathic NSIP is similar in both genders.AssociationsPrimarily idiopathic but the morphological pattern can be seen in association with a number of conditions: connective tissue disorders systemic lupus erythematosus systemic sclerosis Sjögren syndrome  polymyositis 5   dermatomyositis 5    other autoimmune diseases rheumatoid arthritis primary biliary cirrhosis Hashimoto thyroiditis antisynthetase syndrome    drug-induced lung disease: especially chemotherapy agents 4 thalidomide 16   hypersensitivity lung disease slowly healing diffuse alveolar damage (DAD)  relapsing organizing pneumonia occupational exposure immunodeficiency (mainly HIV infection) 13   graft versus host disease (GVHD) 13   immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4)-related sclerosing disease, with or without overlap features with Rosai-Dorfman disease 13  multicentric Castleman disease 13   myelodysplastic syndrome 13  If there is no underlying cause, it is termed idiopathic NSIP; which is now considered a distinct entity.Smoking is not associated, and it is not a protective factor either.Clinical presentationThe symptoms of non-specific interstitial pneumonia are - by definition - non-specific and include insidious onset of dyspnea and dry cough with a restrictive pattern of decreased lung function and reduced gas exchange capacity. PathologyTemporal and spatial homogeneity in a specimen is an essential feature. Historically non-specific interstitial pneumonia was divided into three groups; however, due to similar outcomes, groups II and III (mixed cellular and fibrotic and mostly fibrotic, respectively) are now both classified as fibrotic type:  fibrotic non-specific interstitial pneumonia: more common, interstitial thickening is due to uniform dense or loose fibrosis and mild chronic inflammation; despite fibrotic changes, lung structures still preserved  cellular non-specific interstitial pneumonia: less common; interstitial thickening is mainly due to infiltration of inflammatory cells and type II pneumocyte hyperplasia. Lung architecture is preserved 8  Important negative histological findings are the absence of acute lung injury including hyaline membranes, granulomas, organisms or viral inclusions, dominant airways disease or organizing pneumonia, eosinophils and coarse fibrosis.Radiographic featuresPlain radiographA chest radiograph can be normal in the early stages. There may be ill-defined or ground glass opacities with lower lobe distribution or consolidation in a patchy, reticulonodular or mixed pattern. A bilateral pulmonary infiltrative pattern with volume loss of lower lobes may be seen in those with advanced disease.CTImaging features can overlap between cellular and fibrotic types as well as usual interstitial pneumonitis (UIP) in as high as 30% of patients. Also, temporal changes in the pattern of HRCT findings in subsequent studies shown in as high as 28% of cases resulted in the change of provisional diagnosis from NSIP to UIP.Involvement tends to be subpleural and generally symmetrical with an apicobasilar gradient. Solely or predominantly upper lobe involvement or purely unilateral disease makes the diagnosis of NSIP less likely. Common manifestations include:  ground-glass opacities  tends to be a dominant feature: can be symmetrically or diffusely distributed in all zones or display a basal predominance immediate subpleural sparing 11 - a relatively specific sign mostly bilateral and symmetrical (~86% 14) but can be bilateral and asymmetrical in (10%) and rarely unilateral (3%) mostly subpleural in distribution (~68%) but can be random (21%), diffuse (8%), and rarely central in distribution (3%) 14     reticular opacities and irregular linear opacities (sometimes - minor subpleural reticulation) mainly with fibrotic NSIP 6-7   thickening of bronchovascular bundles: with fibrotic NSIP 6   traction bronchiectasis: associated with fibrotic NSIP  lung volume loss: particularly lower lobes in advanced disease traction bronchiectasis consolidation   microcystic honeycombing: a relatively less common feature   The presence of the following features, although they can be seen in NSIP, should make us think about other differentials: centrilobular nodules mosaic attenuation thin wall cysts Treatment and prognosisIn general, non-specific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP) carries a much more favourable prognosis than a UIP-type pattern with 90% 5-year survival rate for cellular and ~60% (range 45-90%) 5-year survival in the fibrotic subtype. Cellular NSIP shows an even better response to corticosteroids and carries a substantially better prognosis than the fibrotic type. Correct and early diagnosis has a significant impact on patients' outcome because NSIP usually responds well to the corticosteroid therapy or cessation of inciting causes like drugs or organic allergens 12. Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) has also shown to improve lung function 15. History and etymologyIt is thought to have been initially described by Katzenstein and Fiorelli in 1994 14.Differential diagnosisThe key differential is a usual interstitial pneumonitis (UIP) pattern, with which there can be some overlap in imaging features 3. The features which favor the diagnosis of NSIP over UIP are symmetrical bilateral ground-glass opacities with fine reticulations and sparing of the immediate subpleural space. The presence of macroscopic honeycombing is almost diagnostic for UIP.Practical pointsit is important to carefully scrutinise the images, looking for findings such as joint or bony changes, esophageal dilatation, pleural and pericardial effusion, etc., as it has been mentioned earlier NSIP pattern is also associated with many other conditions

__label__Musculoskeletal The non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are one of the most commonly used class of pharmacological agents in the world. They are extremely efficacious medications for pain and the inflammatory response. Their primary mechanism occurs by inhibiting the enzyme cyclo-oxygenase, which coexists in two main isoforms, COX-1 and COX-2. They have significant side-effects, which include GI bleeding, cardiovascular toxicity, and renal impairment. On this page:  Article: Agents Pharmacodynamics Pharmacokinetics Side-effects References   AgentsMany non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs exist, but trials have failed to find significant differences in their effectiveness in treating musculoskeletal symptoms 2. Their main differences are in side-effect profiles:selective COX-2 inhibitors are less likely to cause peptic ulcers but increase the risk of myocardial infarctions and other cardiovascular diseasesPharmacodynamicsThe main pharmacological action of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs is inhibiting the synthesis of prostaglandins (PGs) by blocking the activity of the cyclo-oxygenase enzymes, COX-1 and COX-2.COX-1 is important for the production of prostaglandins which are key to the integrity of the GI mucosa, the maintenance of renal function, platelet interlinking and other key homoeostatic actions. COX-2 is central to the synthesis of prostaglandins key to pain, fever and the inflammatory response. Thus ideally NSAIDs maximize their COX-2 inhibition, therefore blunting inflammation, but minimize their effects upon COX-1 activity, thus decreasing the risk of adverse effects.PharmacokineticsIn general, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, pass easily through the GI mucosa with good bioavailability. NSAIDs bind to carrier proteins in the bloodstream. Hepatic catabolism is the norm, with renal excretion. Effective half-lives of the agents vary widely, as low as 20 minutes for aspirin, and two days for piroxicam.Side-effectsNephrotoxicity disturbance of electrolytes, e.g. hyperkalemia  decreased glomerular filtration rate (GFR)  nephrotic syndrome renal papillary necrosis acute interstitial nephritis Cardiovascular edema hypertension cardiac failure myocardial infarction stroke GI indigestion peptic ulceration bleeding bowel perforation Othersyndrome of inappropriate ADH secretion (SIADH)

As is seen in the rest of the body the proportion of yellow (fatty) marrow increases with age. Knowledge of these changes allows diagnosis of the abnormal clivus. Kimura et al 1 divided the appearance into three grades, by comparing the clivus to the pons and subcutaneous fat. High signal was similar to subcutaneous fat, whereas low was iso- to slightly hypointense to the pons. It should be pointed out that the figures obtained in the study by Kimura et al, have not been exactly replicated in other studies 2,3, and that the grading proposed is by no means widely used in clinical practice. Nonetheless, it serves as a useful guide when examining MRI of the brain, and relating bone marrow signal to age. Classification  grade 1: predominantly low signal (>50% of clivus)  grade 2: mixed signal (low signal 20-50% of clivus)  grade 3: predominantly high signal (>80% of clivus) The signal will vary according to the age of patients 1: patients in their 20s  grade 1: 33% of patients  grade 2: 33%  grade 3: 34%   patients in their 50s  grade 1: 0%  grade 2: 40%  grade 3: 60%   patients in their 80s  grade 1: 0%  grade 2: 0%  grade 3: 100%   Most importantly, a finding of low signal in elderly patients warrants comment and review of additional imaging and clinical information. See also bone marrow clival mass

__label__Hepatobiliary The hepatic veins have a characteristic spectral Doppler waveform. Alterations in the normal hepatic vein waveform may reveal or confirm abnormalities in the heart or liver. On this page:  Article: Terminology Radiographic features Differential diagnosis Related articles References   Images: Cases and figures Imaging differential diagnosis   TerminologyThe shape of the hepatic vein spectral Doppler waveform is primarily determined by pressure changes in the right atrium, or more exactly the blood flow resulting from the resultant pressure gradients. Multiple terms have been used to describe the hepatic vein waveform, including "phasic", "triphasic", "tetrainflectional", and "periodic". Some prefer the term "periodic" since the term "triphasic" already has a specific application in arterial spectral Doppler waveforms and since "periodic" suggests that the waveform is transmitted by cardiac motion rather than systolic flow.Radiographic featuresThe normal periodic hepatic vein waveform is typically described in four parts: a wave: atrial contraction coinciding with the "p wave" on the electrocardiogram, contraction elevates pressure within the right atrium creating a gradient for late diastolic filling of the right ventricle this also creates a pressure gradient favoring a lesser degree of retrograde flow into the IVC and hepatic veins the small reversal of flow typically results in a small wave above the baseline, reversed from the overall net flow back to the heart    s wave: ventricular systole as systole commences, right ventricle contraction results in longitudinal, apically oriented traction on the tricuspid annulus the resultant "stretching" of the right atrium results in a drop in pressure, creating a gradient for anterograde flow from the inferior vena cava and hepatic veins, most pronounced at mid-systole this typically forms the highest velocity deflection seen in the waveform    v wave: atrial overfilling a transitional inflection point as blood fills the right atrium, the flow from the hepatic veins and IVC slows, resulting in the s wave returning back to baselineif the atrium fills to capacity then there may be a small amount of flow "recoil" backward, resulting in a v wave that rises above the baseline     d wave: tricuspid valve opening as the tricuspid valve opens, blood flows from the right atrium into the right ventricle, resulting in a net flow of blood away from the liver and the waveform again dives back down below the baseline this wave is almost always lower in magnitude than the s wave   Sometimes a c wave occurs as a second small inflection above the baseline, right after the a wave, reflecting the effect of the tricuspid valve bulging into the right atrium.Differential diagnosisAlterations in the normal hepatic venous Doppler waveform often indicates cardiac dysfunction, although it may also reflect disease of the hepatic parenchyma and/or vasculature. The consequent hemodynamic perturbations may manifest as: increased pulsatility (exaggeration of anterograde/retrograde velocities)  tricuspid regurgitation abnormally high amplitude of the a and v waves diminished or reversed s wave    congestive heart failure abnormally high amplitude of the a and v waves maintenance of a dominant anterograde S wave > D wavethis presumes tricuspid valvular competence      decrease in phasicity (diminution of anterograde/retrograde velocities)  cirrhosisoften associated with spectral broadening of the Doppler envelope and truncation of the a wave   hepatic veno-occlusive disease (e.g. Budd-Chiari)

__label__Haematology __label__Gastrointestinal In the premultidetector CT era, mesenteric lymph nodes (often shortened to mesenteric nodes) were only really appreciated when enlarged. Following the advent of routine volume acquisition CT (and especially coronal reformats) lymph nodes in the mesentery are commonly seen in normal individuals, which has raised the obvious question of what counts as mesenteric nodal enlargement?As with all such questions (e.g size of common bile duct, size of pancreatic duct etc.), it is really a statistical question determined by: size distribution of normal nodes size distribution of pathological nodes desired sensitivity and specificity As there is clearly a degree of overlap between the size of normal and abnormal nodes the literature is replete with various figures. Various upper limits of normal for short axis diameter include 1:   3 mm: too conservative, with 39% of normal individuals having nodes larger than this 4-5 mm: probably a reasonable compromise 1,2  9-11 mm: may miss many abnormal nodes The other factor to consider is the number of nodes, which may be elevated in some hematological disorders without being enlarged refSee alsolymph node enlargement
__label__Central __label__Nervous __label__System __label__Paediatrics After normal myelination in utero, myelination of the neonatal brain is far from complete. The first myelination is seen as early as the 16th week of gestation, in the column of Burdach, but only really takes off from the 24th week 1. It does not reach maturity until 2 years or so. It correlates very closely to developmental milestones 3. The progression of myelination is predictable and abides by a few simple general rules; myelination progresses from: central to peripheral caudal to rostral dorsal to ventral sensory then motor T1 myelination milestonesTypical T1 myelination milestones include 6:  term birth: dorsal brainstem posterior limb internal capsule perirolandic gyri    3-4 months: ventral brainstem anterior limb internal capsule splenium of corpus callosum central, posterior corona radiata    6 months: cerebellar white matter genu of corpus callosum parietal, occipital white matter    12 months: posterior fossa (~adult) most of corona radiata posterior subcortical white matter    18 months:all white matter except temporal, frontal U-fibers   24 months:anterior temporal, frontal U-fibers  T2 myelination milestonesTypical T2 myelination milestones include 6:  term birth:  dorsal brainstem partial posterior limb internal capsule perirolandic gyri    3-4 months:posterior limb internal capsule   6 months: ventral brainstem anterior limb internal capsule splenium of corpus callosum occipital white matter    12 months: most of corona radiata posterior subcortical white matter    18 months:all white matter except temporal, frontal U-fibers, occipital radiations   24 months:anterior temporal, frontal U-fibers  White matter myelination by locationWhite matter myelination also varies by location 7:  centrum semiovale: T1 at 2-4 months, T2 at 7-11 months  occipital white matter: deep: T1 at 3-5 months, T2 at 9-14 months subcortical: T1 at 4-7 months, T2 at 11-15 months    mid-frontal white matter: deep: T1 at 3-6 months, T2 at 11-16 months subcortical: T1 at 7-11 months, T2 at 14-18 months    anterior frontal white matter: deep: T1 at 5-8 months, T2 at 12-18 months subcortical: T1 at 10-15 months, T2 at 24-30 months   Radiographic featuresCTUnmyelinated white matter is hypodense compared to normal white matter and grey matter.MRI  T1 most sensitive sequence in children <1 year of age 1  myelination represented by T1 hyperintensity    T2 most sensitive sequence in children between the age of 1 and 2 demonstrating a gradual shift from hyper- to hypo-intense relative to grey matter the only area to remain hyperintense after the age of 2 years, and often for quite some time, is the peritrigonal region 4 which is called terminal zones of myelination  differentiation between terminal zones and PVL requires detection of normally myelinated white matter between the patchy hyperintense T2 signal and the lateral ventricle    FLAIR unsurprisingly follows the same pattern as T2 but lags behind somewhat. The exception is deep cerebral white matter, which begins as heterogeneously hypointense during the first few months of life.  this area then joins the remainder of white matter as hypointense before finally once more becoming hypointense in the second year of life 2     proton density: PD weighted images are useful in distinguishing gliosis from hypomyelination  In the acute setting, DWI is more sensitive than either T1 or T2. Fractional anisotropy (FA) increases with brain maturation (diffusion is restricted perpendicular to the direction of axons, thus the increase in DWI signal in large axon bundles running through the slice, e.g posterior limb of internal capsule).MR spectroscopy demonstrates elevated myoinositol and choline in neonates which gradually declines. Myoinositol decreases to adult values by end of first year and choline by 2-3 years. NAA increases with myelination (in the first year of life).

__label__Central __label__Nervous __label__System Normal-pressure hydrocephalus remains a controversial entity with often ambiguous imaging findings. It is classically characterized by the triad of gait apraxia/ataxia, urinary incontinence, and dementia, although not all patients with the condition have all three 31.On imaging, it can be characterized both on CT and MRI by enlarged lateral and third ventricles out of proportion to the cortical sulcal enlargement.This article is focused on idiopathic cases. For a discussion of secondary causes of communicating hydrocephalus, please refer to the article hydrocephalus. On this page:  Article: Terminology Epidemiology Clinical presentation Pathology Radiographic features Treatment and prognosis History and etymology Differential diagnosis References   Images:Cases and figures  TerminologyIt is important to note that there are many causes of communicating hydrocephalus without elevated opening CSF pressures, such as trauma, prior subarachnoid hemorrhage, and meningitis. This is sometimes confusingly referred to as secondary normal pressure hydrocephalus 3. Most clinicians will assume that one is referring to idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus if no qualifier is used.EpidemiologyThe majority of cases are idiopathic. The incidence is much higher in elderly populations. Exact epidemiology is difficult to establish, as the diagnosis is often not made in nursing home patients for the following reasons:  approximately 20% of patients in nursing homes have gait impairment approximately 10% of these patients also have dementia 15% have incontinence 19  A large study in Norway found a striking increase in incidence with increasing age 3: 3.3 per 100,000 for people 50 to 59 years of age 49.3 per 100,000 for people 60 to 69 years of age 181.7 per 100,000 for people 70 to 79 years of age Clinical presentationThe classical clinical findings of normal pressure hydrocephalus are 1-3 urinary incontinence deterioration in cognition (dementia) gait disturbances These can be remembered with the unkind mnemonic Wet, Wacky, and Wobbly. As the name suggests, mean CSF opening pressure is within the normal range  (<18 cmH2O or 13 mmHg) 3. A classic neurological sign in NPH is magnetic gait, where the patients' feet appear to be magnetically attached to the floor.PathologyThe underlying cause remains controversial. One theory is that the condition is an obstructive type of communicating hydrocephalus due to reduced of CSF resorption. A second theory suggests it results from weakening of the ventricular wall due to periventricular white matter ischemic damage 3. The periventricular white matter ischemic change has also been hypothesized to slow the flow of CSF through the extracellular spaces, resulting in a "back-pressure" effect, leading to ventricular enlargement.Shearing forces are exerted on the periventricular white matter as the ventricles enlarge. As the corticospinal tracts to the legs run medially, these tangential shearing forces cause gait disturbance.Radiographic featuresCTAlthough CT is able to visualize the anatomical changes, it is inferior to MRI. MRIMRI is the best modality to image anatomical changes and can further support the diagnosis with CSF flow studies and magnetic resonance spectroscopy.Morphological changes  ventriculomegaly increased Evans' index >0.3 1,2,24,25  widening of the temporal horns of the lateral ventricles >6 mm 2,25  acute callosal angle 1,24-27  upward bowing of the corpus callosum 3,14    disproportionate changes in subarachnoid spaces dilated Sylvian fissures 2,24,25,28  tight high convexity (narrow sulci and subarachnoid spaces at the vertex and medial/parafalcine region) 1,24,25,28   cingulate sulcus sign: posterior half of cingulate sulcus is narrower than the anterior half 1,17  focal/isolated dilation of sulci over the medial surface or convexity (sometimes called transport sulci) 1,24,28,29    The combination of ventriculomegaly, Sylvian fissure widening, and crowding at the vertex has been termed disproportionately enlarged subarachnoid space hydrocephalus (DESH), reflecting disproportionality between the superior and inferior CSF spaces 1,23,27. The finding of DESH without neurologic symptoms has been termed asymptomatic ventriculomegaly with features of idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus on MRI (AVIM) 1.  It is felt by some authors that AVIM is actually a pre-clinical form of iNPH 30. Brain composition changesPeriventricular hypodensity (on CT) or high T2-FLAIR signal (on MRI) is supportive of changes in brain water content seen in NPH, but these findings can also be seen with microvascular ischemic changes or demyelination 2,25.CSF flow changesAlthough prominent aqueductal flow void due to increased CSF velocity across the aqueduct is often seen in patients with NPH - best seen on T2 and PD spin-echo sequences 14 - it is no longer considered a useful sign, as in modern higher field strength MRI machines aqueductal CSF flow void is present in most of the normal subjects. Additionally, it is highly sequence-specific. There is, however, a well-established correlation between higher flow velocities and the favourable outcome after ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunting; hence, quantitative (rather than qualitative) methods have been developed which can be useful not only in patient selection for shunting but also in diagnosis and predicting prognosis 12-15 CSF flow studies 3 increased aqueductal CSF stroke volumeaqueductal CSF stroke volume is the average volume of CSF flowing through the cerebral aqueduct during both systole and diastole  increased aqueductal peak velocity various publications have set various normal and abnormal ranges flow rate of >24.5 mL/min 95% specific for NPH 9,11  stroke volume of ≥42 μL shown in one paper to predict a good response to shunting 10, however, a more recent paper has cast serious doubt on the usefulness of aqueduct stroke volume in patient selection for VP shunting 21  stroke volume upper limit is now suggested to be variable between institutions due to intrinsic scanner differences; thus each center should obtain their own "normal values", with the upper limit being suggested as two times the normal value 16    studies have shown that aqueductal stroke volume decreases later in the disease process despite clinical progressionthis has been theorized to be caused by cerebral atrophy, which indicates that the patient is unlikely to respond to shunt surgery 18    MR spectroscopyMRS has not been shown to have any added value for differentiating idiopathic NPH from other types of dementia, nor does it help in patient selection for VP shunting 22.Nuclear medicineNuclear medicine is less important in diagnosing NPH. Some of the features described are 13 early detection of the radiotracer into lateral ventricles giving a heart-shaped appearance of lateral ventricles rather than a normal trident pattern persistence of radiopharmaceutical beyond 24-48 hours due to impaired absorption radiotracer does not extend to the superior aspect of convexities of lateral ventricles retrograde CSF flow into lateral ventricles Treatment and prognosisTreatment of normal pressure hydrocephalus, once the diagnosis is established, is with CSF shunting, usually a ventriculoperitoneal shunt (VP shunt). The challenge is identifying those patients who will benefit from shunting. Favourable prognostic factors include 3 short duration of presurgical symptoms (less than 6 months) onset of gait disturbance before dementia temporary symptom relief from a CSF tap test (removal of 40ml of CSF via lumbar puncture) absence of significant cerebral vascular disease presence of an aqueductal flow void on T2 imaging 10,14  History and etymologyIt is thought to have been initially described by Colombian neurosurgeon Salomón Hakim and R D Adams in 1965, although it may actually have been described earlier under a different name by McHugh 4,6,7.Differential diagnosisThe possible imaging differential spectrum includes: normal aging brain  Alzheimer dementia: may show greater dilatation of perihippocampal fissures 2   obstructive hydrocephalus: due to mass lesion (e.g. pineal region, tectal plate, midbrain)  Lewy body dementia: visual hallucinations and delusions are more prominent  Parkinson disease: unilateral symptoms are important  AIDS-dementia complex: positive HIV serology

__label__Cardiac Normal pulmonary venous blood flow in the pulmonary veins may be investigated during echocardiography with spectral Doppler analysis. Perturbations in the normal pulmonary venous waveform may indicate the presence of diastolic dysfunction and elevated filling pressures in the left atrium and ventricle. Radiographic featuresPulsed wave Doppler (PWD) of the right superior pulmonary vein, which one may insonate from an apical four-chamber view (A4C), will typically yield a waveform with three positive deflections (S1,S2,D) and one negative deflection (AR) 1. Superior angulation of the transducer from an adequate A4C is often necessary to obtain adequate visualization of the right upper pulmonary vein. Color flow Doppler insonation of the posteromedial left atrium should precede use of PWD to ensure optimal alignment with the pulmonary venous flow. Reduction of the set Nyquist limit is often necessary as the flow velocities of interest are typically modest.Pulsed wave Doppler systolic deflections positive, referred to as S1 and S2, often indistinguishable and simply referred to as the S wave the first (S1) component denotes atrial diastole, with suction of blood into the left atriumabolished with atrial fibrillation   the second (S2) component occurs when the mitral annulus is apically displaced with ventricular systole, decreasing left atrial pressure and creating a gradient for forward flowblunted by mitral regurgitation     diastolic deflections normally a prominently positive, albeit more diminutive, deflection following the sequential systolic componentsreferred to as the D wave  atrial reversal the downstroke of the D wave will often dip below the baseline, indicating flow away from the transducer referred to as the AR wave, corresponding to atrial contraction and "reversal" of flowpositively correlated with inotropic function of the left atrium      Differential diagnosisWhile various pathological entities may disturb flow through the pulmonary veins, a series of predictable changes in the aforementioned waveforms occurs during the progression of diastolic dysfunction. A progressive increase in left atrial pressure will blunt the systolic flow velocities in the pulmonary veins, with the majority of forward flow increasingly occurring during diastole. The elevation in left ventricular end diastolic pressure, secondary to lusitropic incompetence, will exaggerate the flow reversal that occurs with atrial contraction, prolonging the AR wave 4.  diastolic dysfunction on pulmonary venous Doppler the S/D ratio normal filling patterns are predominantly systolic, with an S/D ratio > 1 a pathologic increase in mean left atrial pressure will reverse this pattern, resulting in an S/D ratio < 1 and a diastolic filling predominance progressive increase in amplitude of D wave and a decrease in S wave with increasing filling pressures   atrial reversal velocity and duration normally the peak of the AR wave is < 35 cm/s a peak velocity exceeding this upper limit implies elevated filling pressures the AR wave duration is typically examined in concert with the mitral inflow velocities the transmitral A wave and the pulmonary venous AR wave should be roughly similar in length the duration of the latter should only exceed the former by < 20 m/s, with greater discrepancies occurring with elevated filling pressures 3  a sensitive indicator of pseudonormalization of the filling pattern (stage III diastolic dysfunction)        atrial fibrillation on pulmonary venous Dopplerabolition of organized atrial contraction decreases the peak of the S1 wave and decreases the peak velocity of the AR wave  elevated lusitropy on pulmonary venous Doppler the enhanced relaxation found in young patients may also reverse the S/D ratio and mimic advanced diastolic dysfunction vigorous left ventricular suction results in elevated peak D wave velocities, with a restrictive transmitral filling pattern if doubt exists regarding the consequence of these findings, tissue Doppler of the mitral annulus is required   heart failure with a preserved ejection fraction vigorous longitudinal excursion of the mitral annulus during systole may obfuscate increased filling pressures by preserving the (S>D) pulmonary venous systolic filling dominancethe velocity of the S2 wave is proportionate to the pressure gradient created by this contraction  however, increased LVEDP imposes an afterload on the left atrium, shortening the duration of the transmitral A wave while simultaneously prolonging the duration of the pulmonary AR wave increasing disparity between the AR duration and the A wave duration correlates with elevations in filling pressures

__label__Spine The notochord represents the earliest fetal axial skeleton, extending from the Rathke pouch to the coccyx. It is a primitive cell line from which the skull base and vertebral column develop. The notochord is cylindrical and is replaced by sclerotomes that produce cartilage, and subsequently bone. Remnants of the notochord usually remain near the midline and are entrapped in bone. Chordomas are a malignant tumor that can develop from the notochord remnants.The nucleus pulposus of the intervertebral discs represent residual notochord.Vestigial non-neoplastic notochordal remnants are seen in up to 2% of cadavers, usually in the midline. They are located: spheno-occipital synchondrosis sacrococcygeal regions smaller scattered foci in the spine (especially C2 and lumbar spine) Related pathology the location of chordomas parallels this distribution  Thornwaldt cysts are also notochord-derived  ecchordosis physaliphora  large craniopharyngeal canal fossa navicularis magna

__label__Hepatobiliary Nubbin sign (also called as cystic duct sign) is an important sign in a HIDA scan (cholescintigraphy using iminodiacetic acid analogs) that may be seen in cases of gallbladder neck obstruction. The "nubbin" refers to a small amount of radiotracer activity in the cystic duct, with absence of tracer in the gallbladder. It indicates lack of radionuclide uptake into gallbladder and therefore suggests acute cholecystitis.
__label__Obstetrics __label__Gynaecology Nuchal cord is a term given to the situation where there are one or more loops of umbilical cord wrapped around the fetal neck for ≥360°. On this page:  Article: Epidemiology Pathology Radiographic features Treatment and prognosis Differential diagnosis References   Images: Cases and figures Imaging differential diagnosis   EpidemiologyThe prevalence is dependent on the extent of coiling and range from ~25% for a single loop to 2.5% for a double loop to ~0.5% for more than two loops 1,2. Overall prevalence tends to increase with advancing gestational age. There may be an increased male predilection.PathologyThe etiology of nuchal cords is controversial and unclear. Some suggest that fetuses with nuchal cords have less vascular coiling than those that do not (65%). ClassificationAccording to the Giacomello classification system, a nuchal cord be can be of two types 4,8: type A: a nuchal loop that encircles the neck in a freely sliding pattern, where the placental end crosses over the umbilical end. This pattern can undo itself type B: a nuchal loop that encircles the neck in a locked pattern, where the placental end crosses under the umbilical end. This pattern locks and cannot undo itself with potential for fetal morbidity or mortality Associations long umbilical cord polyhydramnios Radiographic featuresAntenatal ultrasound on gery-scale ultrasound may show a small dent or impression due to compression of the fetal neck posteriorly on sagittal plane may also be present (termed the grey-scale divot sign 10) may be seen as a persisting structure wrapped around the fetal neck with color flow present on Doppler interrogation color Doppler also helps to assess single or multiple turns of nuchal cord in sagittal section  Treatment and prognosisSome advocate immediate and repeated fetal testing measures should be sought when further complicating issues are confronted.Complications formation of a cord knot   tight cord around the neck syndrome (tCAN syndrome)  intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) fetal developmental delay decreased amniotic fluid volumes  neonatal anemia decreased fetal movements hypovolemia and metabolic acidosis  post dates in rare situations, intrauterine fetal death  Differential diagnosisFor extra tissue around the fetal neck on ultrasound consider:  cystic hygroma: no color flow redundant uncoiled cord adjacent to the fetal neck  
__label__Obstetrics __label__Paediatrics The nuchal fold is a normal fold of skin seen at the back of the fetal neck during the second trimester of pregnancy. Increased thickness of the nuchal fold is a soft marker associated with multiple fetal anomalies, and is measured on a routine second trimester ultrasound.  On this page:  Article: Terminology Epidemiology Pathology Radiographic features See also Related articles References   Images:Cases and figures  TerminologyIt should not be confused with nuchal translucency, which is measured in the first trimester. EpidemiologyAssociationsThe predominant reason for measuring the nuchal fold is that it is a soft marker for aneuploidy. As an isolated finding, it has a likelihood ratio of 3.25 for Down syndrome9.Other associations include: Turner syndrome congenital heart disease Klippel-Feil syndrome Zellweger syndrome Cumming syndrome  Robert syndrome7  PathologyThe proposed etiology of increased nuchal thickness is the result of hydrops or lymphatic obstruction. Natural courseAn abnormally thickened nuchal fold or even a cystic hygroma may resolve, especially toward the third trimester; however, the risk of karyotypic abnormalities is not reduced.Radiographic featuresAntenatal ultrasoundNuchal fold thickness of >6 mm is abnormal on a routine morphology ultrasound performed at 18-22 weeks.The nuchal fold is known to increase throughout the second trimester in a normal pregnancy, and may be measured during a broader window of 14 and 24 weeks when required. There is some controversy regarding the normative thresholds at the earlier and later gestations - some authors advocate the use of a nomogram 10, others suggest that the 6 mm upper limit may be appropriate up to 24 weeks 11. ​Technical considerationsNuchal fold thickness is measured on an axial section through the head at the level of the thalami, cavum septi pellucidi, and cerebellar hemispheres (i.e. in the same plane that is used to assess the posterior fossa structures). One caliper should be placed on the outer edge of the skin, and the other against the outer edge of the occipital bone. The ideal angle of insonation is at approximately 30o to the horizontal. This plane is less likely to produce a false positive thickened nuchal fold.See also nuchal edema nuchal translucency 
__label__Obstetrics Nuchal translucency is the normal fluid-filled subcutaneous space identified at the back of the fetal neck during the late first trimester and early second trimester (11 weeks 3 days to 13 weeks 6 days).It should not be confused with the nuchal fold, which is seen in the second trimester.   On this page:  Article: Pathology Radiographic features Treatment and prognosis Differential diagnosis See also Related articles References   Images:Cases and figures  PathologyIncreased nuchal translucency is thought to be related to dilated lymphatic channels and is considered a nonspecific sign of more generalized fetal abnormality. Measurement of the nuchal translucency requires specific and standardized assessment and careful attention to technique.AssociationsThickening of the nuchal translucency can be associated with a number of anomalies, including:  aneuploidy  trisomies (including Down syndrome) Turner syndrome   non-aneuploidy structural defects and syndromes  congenital heart disease: risk varies from 2% at 95th percentile to 5% at 99th percentile (3.5 mm), with septal defects the commonest abnormality 10   Noonan syndrome: the only genetic molecular condition with a clear association with increased nuchal translucency congenital diaphragmatic herniation omphalocele skeletal dysplasias Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome VACTERL association    miscarriage or fetal demise: the risk is directly proportionate to increased nuchal translucency thickness and ranges from 1.6% with NT between 95-99th percentile to 20% with NT > 6.5 mm 11   intrauterine infections: Parvovirus B19 is the only specific pathogen with direct relation to increased NT due to the effect of fetal anemia and fetal myocardial infarction  Radiographic featuresNuchal lucency is measured on a sagittal image through the fetal neck.TechniqueUse of the correct technique is essential: the fetus must be in midsagittal imaging plane (the vertebral column should be facing the bottom of the screen); the following structures must be seen to confirm correct mid-sagittal position: two tiny parallel echogenic lines  tip of the nose nasal bone (if not absent)   hard palate diencephalon    magnification so that only fetal head and upper thorax included in the image: enabling 1 mm changes in measurement possible the fetal head should not be extended or flexed the fetus should be floating free of the uterine wall i.e. amniotic fluid should be seen between its back and the uterus; this is to not mistakenly measure the distance to the amniotic membrane or uterine wall the "+" calipers should be used for measurement only the lucency is measured (again differing from nuchal thickness) the calipers are put inside the hyperechoic edges   the widest part of the translucency should be measured Assessment values obtained when the CRL is between 45 and 84 mm (11 weeks 3 days to 13 weeks 6 days) may be used for combined first-trimester screening the lucent region is generally not septated the thickness rather than the appearance (morphology) is considered to be directly related to the incidence of chromosomal and other anomalies a value of less than 2.2 - 2.8 mm in thickness is not associated with increased risk, however, it is maternal age-dependent and needs to be matched to exact gestational age and crown-rump length (CRL) Nuchal translucency cannot be adequately assessed if there is: unfavorable fetal lie  unfavorable gestational age: CRL < 45 or > 84 mm InterpretationThe rate of aneuploidy is directly proportional to the value of nuchal translucency 9: < 2 mm have a risk < 1%. 3.4 mm have a risk of 7% 3.5-4.4 mm have a risk of 20% 5.5-6.4 mm have a risk of 50% ≥8.5 mm have a risk of 75% In the majority of fetuses with trisomy 21, the nuchal translucency thickness was < 4.5 mm, while with trisomies 13 or 18 it was 4.5-8.4 mm, and in those with Turner syndrome it was 8.5 mm or more 9.Correlation with serum markersTo increase the clinical accuracy of nuchal lucency, it can be correlated with serum markers such as: maternal B-HCG alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) pregnancy-associated plasma protein A (PAPP-A) estriol/estriol The combination of nuchal translucency thickness, PAPP-A, and hCG detects 87% of cases of trisomy 21 at 11 weeks, 85% at 12 weeks, and 82% at 13 weeks, with a 5% false-positive rate 8.Further workupIf abnormal NT and screening test results show an increased risk of less than 1 in 300, further workup may be carried out based on the patient's desire after counseling. Further investigations include:  amniocentesis and/or chorionic villus sampling  fetal echocardiography Treatment and prognosisAs the second-trimester approaches, the region of nuchal translucency might either: regress if chromosomally normal, a large proportion of fetuses will have a normal outcome spontaneous regression does not, however, mean a normal karyotype   evolve into nuchal edema cystic hygroma   normal outcome: the change is proportionate to NT value 12 3.5-4.4 mm have a chance of 70% 4.5-5.4 mm have a chance of 50% 5.5-6.4 mm have a chance of 30% >6mm have a chance of 15%   Differential diagnosis incorrect technique fetal neck skin thickening due to first-trimester hydrops fetalis  amniotic membrane lying behind the fetal neck chorio-amniotic separation See alsoautomatic online crown-rump length and nuchal translucency calculator from www.perinatology.com

__label__Central __label__Nervous __label__System The nucleus accumbens (NAc) (plural: nuclei accumbentes) (colloquially known as the pleasure center) is a small region in the forebrain below the corpus striatum. It is involved in the reward pathway and is therefore involved in impulse control disorders. On this page:  Article: Summary Gross anatomy Arterial supply Radiographic features Related articles References   Summary It is located in the basal ganglia at the anteroinferior aspect of the corpus striatum  It is involved in the reward pathway It receives vascular supply from the medial lenticulostriate arteries  It is connected to the ventral tegmental area (VTA), the prefrontal cortex (PFC), basolateral amygdala (BLA) and the lateral hypothalamus (LH)  Gross anatomyLocationThe nucleus accumbens is part of the basal ganglia. It is not a separate structure and hence cannot be identified distinctly on cerebral specimens.There appears to be ambiguity in terms of its relationship with the ventral striatum as some sources identify that the nucleus accumbens was formerly known as the ventral striatum, while others identify it as a part of the ventral striatum 1,2. RelationsThe nucleus accumbens receives dopaminergic innervation from the ventral tegmental area (VTA) in the brainstem, glutaminergic from the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and orexinergic innervation from the lateral hypothalamus (LH) 2.FunctionThe predominant role of the nucleus accumbens is to influence planning and aversion based on pleasurable stimuli. This information is conveyed to the prefrontal cortex (PFC), lateral hypothalamus (LH) and the brain stem 1,2.Dopaminergic innervation from the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and glutaminergic innervation from the PFC are responsible for the reward pathway for food, sex and music. The nucleus accumbens (NAc) also receives orexinergic projections from the LH which are thought to model the psychosomatic response to psychostimulant drugs 3.Arterial supplyThe nucleus accumbens receives blood supply from the recurrent artery of Heubner, which is a branch of the medial lenticulostriate arteries 4.Radiographic featuresMRIThe nucleus accumbens is too small to be visualized on MRI. Other features that make it difficult to visualize the nucleus accumbens are its proximity to the cerebral sinuses and pulsating arterioles.On fMRI, the nucleus accumbens is activated when patients actively crave pleasurable stimulus and it is inactivated when the stimulus has been received 5.
__label__Central __label__Nervous __label__System The nucleus ambiguus is a large nucleus within the medulla oblongata that provides motor innervation to muscles of the pharynx, larynx and soft palate in addition to housing preganglionic nuclei involved in parasympathetic nervous system augmentation of heart rate 1,2.Gross AnatomyThe nucleus ambiguus is a paired nucleus located in the lateral aspect of the rostral medulla.It lies dorsal to the inferior olivary nucleus and ventromedial to the spinal nucleus and tract of the trigeminal nerve (CN V). It is located medial to the lateral spinothalamic tract.The dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus nerve (CN X) and the solitary tract nucleus both lie dorsal to the nucleus ambiguus, and their respective fibers course around the dorsolateral aspect of the nucleus ambiguus.InnervationThe nucleus ambiguus houses cell bodies which provide motor fibers to the glossopharyngeal (CN IX), vagus (CN X) and spinal accessory nerves (CN XI). These fibers pass laterally from the nucleus ambiguus to exit the medulla in the postolivary sulcus.The nucleus ambiguus provides motor innervation to the stylopharyngeus muscle with the efferent fibers traveling within the glossopharyngeal nerve (CN IX).The nucleus ambiguus also provides motor innervation to the superior, middle and inferior pharyngeal constrictor muscles in addition to the muscles of the soft palate (palatopharyngeus, salpingopharyngeus, levator veli palatini, palatoglossus and the muscles of the uvula). These efferent fibers arising from the nucleus ambiguus travel through pharyngeal branches of the vagus nerve (CN X) which arise from the inferior (nodose) vagal ganglion.The external laryngeal nerve supplies the cricothyroid muscle (the only intrinsic muscle of the larynx not supplied by the recurrent laryngeal nerve).The recurrent laryngeal nerve provides motor innervation to all of the intrinsic laryngeal muscles except the cricothyroid muscle.The nucleus ambiguus also houses preganglionic neurons which contribute to vagal parasympathetic control of heart rate.

It is significantly less invasive than the Ravitch procedure and has largely replaced it.Differential diagnosisA reverse Nuss procedure can be performed for treatment of pectus carinatum 1; the main difference is that the bar is placed superficially to the sternum, instead of deep to the sternum, to pull the sternum back towards the spine.See alsoRavitch procedure
__label__Musculoskeletal A nutcracker fracture of the cuboid refers to a cuboid bone fracture with associated navicular avulsion fracture due to compression between the bases of 4th and 5th metatarsals and calcaneus bone. The injury usually occurs secondary to the traumatic abduction of the forefoot. This results in loss of the normal lateral column support and excess valgus force upon the medial column that commonly causes rupture of tibialis posterior tendon or avulsion fracture of its attachment onto medial aspect of the tarsal navicular bone.See alsolower extremity fractures
__label__Gastrointestinal __label__Vascular __label__Urogenital The nutcracker phenomenon, also known as nutcracker anatomy or left renal vein entrapment, refers to the anatomic or pathophysiologic entity wherein the superior mesenteric artery compresses and impedes outflow of the left renal vein into the inferior vena cava. It can be a common incidental finding on routine CT imaging and many patients can be asymptomatic 2. If associated with relevant symptoms, it is then known as the nutcracker syndrome.Radiographic featuresCross-sectional imaging demonstrates narrowing of the mesoaortic interval or angle as well as dilatation of the lateral (hilar) aspect of the left renal vein. There may also be dilatation of the gonadal vein with reflux of contrast material.
__label__Urogenital __label__Vascular Nutcracker syndrome is a vascular compression disorder that refers to the compression of the left renal vein most commonly between the superior mesenteric artery (SMA) and aorta, although other variations can exist 1. This can lead to renal venous hypertension, resulting in rupture of thin-walled veins into the collecting system with resultant hematuria. On this page:  Article: Terminology Epidemiology Clinical presentation Pathology Radiographic features Complications Treatment and prognosis History and etymology See also References   Images:Cases and figures  TerminologyIn certain situations, the syndrome can result from a retroaortic or circumaortic left renal vein.Nutcracker syndrome should not be confused with superior mesenteric artery syndrome (Wilkie syndrome) also a superior mesenteric artery compression disorder, where the SMA compresses the third part of the duodenum (the two conditions, however, may be associated).EpidemiologyThere is a slightly greater female predilection.Clinical presentationThe most common clinical manifestations of nutcracker syndrome are left flank pain, pelvic pain, hematuria and gonadal varices. Orthostatic proteinuria has also been reported. Hematuria can be microscopic or macroscopic. Hematuria should be from the left ureteric orifice only 4. In the absence of clinical symptoms, renal vein compression is referred to as nutcracker phenomenon or nutcracker anatomy, which can be a more common situation.PathologyAssociations may occur simultaneously with SMA syndrome  an association with a thin or asthenic body habitus has long been noted. TypesCompression of the left renal vein can occur primarily in two anatomic locations 10.  anterior nutcracker syndrome (classical): occurs at the branching of the SMA off of the aorta  posterior nutcracker syndrome (rarer form): a retroaortic left renal vein is compressed between the aorta and vertebrae rarely, a combination form may occur  Radiographic featuresRadiographic features are similar on ultrasound, Doppler ultrasound, CT, MRI, and conventional angiography: For classical form reduced aortic-SMA angle: normal angle between aorta and SMA is ~45° (range 38-65°) left renal vein stenosis collateral pathways: main collateral pathway is the left gonadal vein which will display early enhancement during portal venous phase pressure gradient >3 mmHg on renal venography in early-stage nutcracker syndrome; well-developed collateral veins dissipate the high-pressure gradient compression ratio (CR) given by the anteroposterior diameter of the precompressed vein (P) divided by that of the compressed vein (C); namely, CR = P/Ca compression ratio above 2.25 is highly sensitive and specific for nutcracker syndrome 10   ComplicationsPersistent hematuria can precipitate renal vein thrombosis 4.Treatment and prognosisTreatment should be started strictly when it is causing symptoms (hematuria and left flank pain). Surgical treatment modalities have their inherent complications and should be contemplated only when strongly indicated. A few of the reported surgical choices are: left renal vein transposition 5  kidney autotransplant superior mesenteric artery transposition gonadal vein transposition nephrectomy extravascular stent placement endovascular stent-graft placement 6  History and etymologyThe first clinical report of this syndrome was made by El-Sadr and Mina in 1950 while the term "nutcracker syndrome" is thought to have been first used by de Schepper in 1972 7.See alsovascular compression disorders
__label__Hepatobiliary A nutmeg liver appearance is due to a perfusion abnormality of the liver usually as result of hepatic venous congestion. When hepatic veins are congested, contrast is prevented from diffusing through the liver in a normal manner. This results in a mottled pattern of contrast enhancement in the arterial and early portal venous phase with decreased enhancement of the liver periphery. The areas of decreased enhancement are due to decreased portal flow, hepatic congestion and ischemia. On delayed images enhancement of the liver becomes more uniform. Conditions associated with hepatic venous congestion include: hepatic veno-occlusive disease Budd-Chiari syndrome  congestive hepatopathy congestive heart failure constrictive pericarditis   In the Budd-Chiari syndrome, the caudate lobe enhances normally as it has a separate draining vein directly into the inferior vena cava.
__label__Musculoskeletal A nutrient foramen (plural: nutrient foramina) or vascular channel is a small tunnel through the cortex of a long bone containing a nutrient artery which supplies the bone. The foramina are known to mimic oblique fractures on plain radiographs 1. The nutrient artery enters a long bone via an obliquely oriented canal, that can appear as a radiolucent line passing through the cortex into the medullary portion of the diaphysis of the bone. They are often observed with a well-corticated edge 1. The direction of the oblique canal is relative to the rate of growth occurring at both ends of the long bone 2.FrequencyAlthough not all nutrient foramina will be visible in plain radiography, it is important to know the frequency in which they occur.  majority of humeri possess a single nutrient foramen 2. However, humeri with two 2,3 or no 4 foramina have been reported up to 99% of radii have a single foramen 2, again with some studies cited two or none 3  the ulna regularly presents with a single foramen, with as many as three cited in anatomical studies 5  studies regarding the nutrient foramen of the femur range from one to as many as nine 6  the tibia primarily possesses nutrient foramina on the posterior aspect of the diaphysis; with a single foramen most common 2  the fibula most commonly possesses a single foramen however as many as three has been reported 2,3  the phalanges typically possess a single foramen however the proximal phalanges of the fingers commonly have two, with all foramina directed away from the origin of bone growth 7

Ultrasound is the most affected modality 4. Moreover in obese patients, additional numbers of x-ray photons are required to achieve images of the same quality, resulting in a small, but increased ionizing radiation dose. USObese patients produce a challenge to the ultrasound practitioner for two main interrelated technical reasons 13: increased adipose tissue increases the distance that the ultrasound waves have to travel to reach the target tissue fatty soft tissue attenuates the beam, reducing the strength of the waves reaching, and also returning from, the target tissue In combination this results in a decrease in signal-to-noise ratio.Moreover obese patients may also find it more difficult: to change position to allow the sonographer to use the best acoustic window to hold their breath, which may be required to optimize the image CTImage quality can be reduced due to beam hardening, out of field artifact and limited field of view, but there is the trade-off of increased contrast due to greater intra-abdominal fat 3. Treatment and prognosisA variety of non-surgical treatments have been attempted in these patients with disappointing results. Surgical approaches to treating obesity, collectively known as bariatric procedures, have been far more promising and are now routinely used to treat patients with morbid obesity 1,2.ComplicationsObesity increases the risk of many conditions including being an independent risk factor for cancer. It has a significant negative effect on life expectancy 10,11: diabetes mellitus hypertension coronary artery disease stroke gastro-esophageal reflux disease osteoarthritis malignancy, e.g. esophageal cancer, endometrial cancer, renal cancer, colorectal cancer, breast cancer  spinal epidural lipomatosis obesity hypoventilation syndrome increased mortality in severe trauma 12  
__label__Central __label__Nervous __label__System The obex is the most caudal point within the fourth ventricle, as it narrows and communicates with the central canal of the spinal cord. It is one of four routes via which cerebrospinal fluid may flow from the fourth ventricle (the others being the median and two lateral apertures).The obex occurs at the level of the foramen magnum. Therefore, it also represents the level which distinguishes the intracranial medulla and the extracranial spinal cord.History and etymology"Obex" is Latin for "barrier".
__label__Chest The oblique fissures (also called the major fissures or greater fissures) are bilateral structures in both lungs separating the lung lobes.  On this page:  Article: Gross anatomy Variant anatomy Radiographic features Related articles References   Images:Cases and figures  Gross anatomyRight oblique fissureThe superior part of the right oblique fissure separates the right upper lobe from the right lower lobe and the inferior part separates the right middle lobe from the right lower lobe. Its approximate position can be marked by a curved line on the thoracic wall that begins roughly at the spinous process of the T4 level of the thoracic spine, then crosses the fifth intercostal space laterally, and follows the contour of the right 6th rib anteriorly 1.Left oblique fissureThe left oblique fissure separates the left upper lobe from the left lower lobe.Its approximate position can be marked by a curved line on the thoracic wall that begins between the spinous processes of vertebrae T3 and T4, then crosses the fifth intercostal space laterally, and follows the contour of the 6th rib anteriorly 1.Variant anatomyThe oblique fissures are highly variable and may be incomplete or absent, thus complicating the identification of various pathological processes. In the majority of cases the left oblique fissure is located at a higher level and courses more vertically than the right oblique fissure 2.Both oblique fissures can present as incomplete fissures (48% on the right compared with 43% on the left). Absence of the oblique fissure is rare and occurs in <1% of the population 2.Radiographic featuresThe oblique fissures can be visualized on both conventional radiography and computed tomography (CT) scans. For transthoracic biopsies, especially those for lesions located in the upper lobes, knowledge of the exact anatomy of the oblique fissures is essential to avoid crossing the oblique fissures.On a lateral radiograph, the right oblique fissure ends at the anterior costophrenic angle and the left oblique fissure ends about 5 cm posterior to the anterior costophrenic angle 3.Occasionally the superior aspect of the left major fissure may mimic pneumomediastinum, so called pseudopneumomediastinum.

__label__Central __label__Nervous __label__System Obstructive hydrocephalus is a term usually used to denote obstructive non-communicating hydrocephalus. It is actually a term that causes confusion as used in the above sense implies that communicating hydrocephalus does not have an obstruction to CSF flow / absorption; this is not true as the majority of cases of communicating hydrocephalus have obstruction to CSF flow through the subarachnoid space or impaired absorption at the arachnoid granulations.   For a discussion of this terminology, please refer to the most general article on hydrocephalus. The remainder of this article pertains to the commonly used meaning of obstructive hydrocephalus, namely obstructive non-communicating hydrocephalus.  On this page:  Article: Epidemiology Clinical presentation Radiographic features Treatment and prognosis References   Images:Cases and figures  EpidemiologyThe demographics of affected patients will depend on the underlying causes, which include: congenital aqueduct stenosis  obstructing tumor or mass (e.g. tectal plate glioma, colloid cyst) Clinical presentationAs is the case with most mass effect conditions affecting the brain, the presentation will vary dramatically depending on the speed of onset. In acute obstructive hydrocephalus, as is the case with a colloid cyst obstructing the foramina of Monro, a sudden increase in intraventricular pressure can lead to rapid loss of consciousness and even death. In other patients where the obstruction is incomplete or gradual (e.g. aqueduct stenosis), there may be almost no symptoms despite massive dilatation of the ventricles. Overall the presentation will depend on the presence of raised intracranial pressure that has the usual constellation of symptoms including headaches, made worse with stooping or straining, nausea and vomiting. Papilledema may be evident 2. In children whose cranial sutures have yet to fuse, there is a rapid enlargement of the head circumference 2. Radiographic featuresBoth CT and MRI (and ultrasound in the neonatal period) can demonstrate most of the features, although the underlying cause may be more or less easily discernible  (e.g. a web across the aqueduct causing aqueduct stenosis will only be visible on dedicated high-resolution MRI images). Acute obstructive hydrocephalusAn important caveat to be aware of is that in acute obstructive hydrocephalus in young patients only minor ventriculomegaly may be visible despite the significant elevation of intracranial pressure.If previous films are available, they are probably the most reliable way of identifying early hydrocephalus. Features that are helpful in making the diagnosis of acute obstructive hydrocephalus include 3:  lateral ventricles enlargement of the temporal horns (best indicator)  transependymal edema, or periventricular oozing, may be visible as high T2 signal on MRI or low-density change on CT around the margins of the ventricles, and should not be confused with white matter change of chronic small vessel ischemia.     third ventricle outward bowing of the lateral walls inferior bowing of the floor    fourth ventricle poor indicator of hydrocephalus as the confined nature of the posterior fossa prevents significant enlargement a prominent fourth ventricle suggests that the obstruction is either at the foramina of Luschka and Magendie or within the subarachnoid space   Chronic non-communicating obstructive hydrocephalusNon-communicating obstructive hydrocephalus (often merely referred to as obstructive hydrocephalus) is usually a relatively straightforward diagnosis to make on imaging. Over time, the portions of the ventricular system upstream from the obstruction gradually enlarge compressing and thinning the overlying cortex. Features of long standing non-communicating obstructive hydrocephalus (at the level of the aqueduct of Sylvius or below) include 1-3: marked dilatation of the ventricles, especially the lateral and third ventricles thinned and elevated corpus callosum  fenestration of the septum pellucidum  depression of the fornices the floor of the 3rd ventricle is displaced inferiorly, abutting the skull base, obliterating the suprasellar cistern outward bowing (ballooning) of the recesses of the third ventricle (infundibular, optic and pineal recesses) ballooning of the suprapineal recess Treatment and prognosisTreatment depends on the cause and location of the obstruction. In some patients with temporary obstruction (such as with subarachnoid hemorrhage), temporary CSF diversion is sufficient (e.g. via an external ventricular drain (EVD)). Similarly, if the cause is mechanical, it may be possible to resect the mass (e.g. colloid cyst). In many cases obstruction is permanent or unable to be directly treated (e.g. most tectal gliomas), and as such permanent CSF diversion may be required. Treatment options include: shunting, most commonly with a VP shunt   third ventriculostomy is useful in patients with non-communicating obstructive hydrocephalus at or below the level of the aqueduct of Sylvius

It can also help characterize lesions and determine the level of obstruction.MRIMRCP (MR cholangiopancreatography) is a specific type of MRI of the abdomen. It looks specifically at the fluid within the biliary tree and is very helpful when determining the level of biliary obstruction.MRI Liver can be performed to characterize liver lesions and requires the use of IV contrast.CTCT is used for the assessment of extrahepatic mass lesions that cause biliary obstruction and also to determine if there is distant spread in suspected malignancy.
__label__Chest The term obstructive lung disease is usually a spirometric term whereby the small airways are partially obstructed by a pathological condition.It is usually characterized by some form of airway obstruction. In these patients narrowing (obstruction) of the smaller bronchi and larger bronchioles occur often because of excessive contraction of the smooth muscle itself. There can be inflamed and easily collapsible airways with obstruction to airflow.The commonest forms are asthma and COPD.Patient's obstructive lung disease typically have a concave flow volume (F/V) loop.See alsorestrictive lung disease
__label__Head __label__& __label__Neck __label__Chest Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), also known as obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS), is a disorder characterized by repetitive episodes of total (i.e. apnoeas) or reduction (i.e. hypopnoeas) in ventilation due to total or partial collapse of the upper airway during sleep.This condition is distinct from central sleep apnea. On this page:  Article: Epidemiology Clinical presentation Pathology Radiographic features Treatment and prognosis Differential diagnosis References   Images:Cases and figures  EpidemiologyObstructive sleep apnea is very common, affecting both pediatric and adult populations 1-3. The disorder is more common in men and in adults its incidence increases with age 1-3.Risk factors male sex 1-5  increased age 1-5  obesity 1-5   hypothyroidism 1,2   acromegaly 1,2  various genetic syndromes (e.g. Down syndrome, Marfan syndrome) 1,6  Clinical presentationObstructive sleep apnea has a varied clinical presentation 1-3. Signs and symptoms include daytime sleepiness, gasping or choking awakenings, pauses in breathing during sleep, snoring during sleep (less prominent in pediatrics), nocturnal bradyarrhythmias, morning headache, and behavioral sequela of poor sleep such as lack of concentration and irritability (more prominent in pediatrics) 1-3. Given many of these clinical features occur during sleep, affected patients may often be unaware of these, even in severe cases of obstructive sleep apnea 2.These clinical features can be detected formally in a diagnostic polysomnogram 1-3. This test may include all or some of electroencephalography (EEG), electrooculography (EOG), chin electromyography (EMG), electrocardiography (ECG), respiratory inductance plethysmography, nasal oral airflow measurements, pulse oximetry, expired carbon dioxide monitoring, transcutaneous carbon dioxide monitoring, and video monitoring 1-3. Such monitoring allows for detection of apnoeas and hypopnoeas, which are utilized in the apnea-hypopnoea index (AHI) to determine the number of breathing abnormalities per hour of sleep 1-3. Obstructive sleep apnea is defined an AHI of five or more 1-3.PathologyDuring sleep, especially REM sleep, there is relaxation of the upper airway muscles, including the tongue and pharyngeal dilator muscles (e.g. genioglossus) 1-4. In those with anatomical risk factors for obstructive sleep apnea, relaxation of upper airway muscles while supine may lead to obstruction of the upper airway 1-4. When this obstruction is complete, there are clinical apnoeas, and when partial there are clinical hypopnoeas 1-4.These obstructions lead to hypoxia and hypercapnia, which in turn lead to arousal from sleep in order to increase tone of the upper airway 1-4. This leads to cessation of the apnea or hypopnoea, and return to normal unobstructed upper airway flow 1-4. When sleep recommences, this cycle may repeat itself 1-4.This cycle leads to fragmentation of sleep, resulting in daytime sleepiness and associated behavioral symptoms 1-4. Furthermore, episodic oxygen desaturations lead to episodic sympathetic overactivity and loss of normal blood pressure nocturnal dipping, leading to an increased cardiovascular risk 1-3,7.Radiographic featuresImaging is not utilized as a tool to diagnose obstructive sleep apnea, but rather, has a role in evaluating the upper airway for anatomical factors that may be contributing to sleep apnea, and for purposes of pre-operative planning 4,5.Generally, features that may indicate risk of obstructive sleep apnea on cross-sectional imaging (e.g. CT or MRI) of the head and neck: narrowing of upper airway 4,5one study highlights a risk associated with a transverse dimension of the upper oropharyngeal airway <10 mm and an elongation of the oropharynx >70 mm 4   excess soft tissue surrounding the upper airway, including tonsil and/or adenoid hypertrophy, fat, or muscle 4,5  pharyngeal tumors or cysts 4,5  tongue anomalies (e.g. macroglossia, glossoptosis) 4,5  palatal anomalies (e.g. high arched palate) 4,5  jaw anomalies (e.g. micrognathia, retrognathia) 4,5  nasal anomalies (e.g. nasal polyps, septal deviation) 4,5  hyoid anomalies (e.g. inferiorly situated) 4,5  thyroid anomalies (e.g. ectopic thyroid, goiter) 4,5  other craniofacial anomalies 4,5  Treatment and prognosisManagement encompasses lifestyle changes as well as non-invasive and potentially invasive treatments 1-3.In regard to lifestyle, weight loss, sleeping on one’s side, avoiding alcohol, and smoking cessation are recommended 1-3. Additionally, the diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea may have implications on driving (depending on country of residence), especially if driving commercially 1,2.Non-invasive management includes mandibular advancement splints, and, what is considered to be the gold-standard treatment – continuous positive airways pressure (CPAP) 1-3. Generally, CPAP should be offered to all patients with at least moderate disease 1-3.Invasive management includes device implantation such as a hypoglossal nerve stimulator, and surgery such as uvulopalatopharyngoplasty, adenotonsillectomy, or nasal surgery 1,3,8. These management options are not offered to all patients, depending on their respective anatomical risk factors for obstructive sleep apnea 1,3.Differential diagnosisobesity hypoventilation syndrome

__label__Vascular __label__Musculoskeletal The obturator artery is a branch of the anterior division of the internal iliac artery. It provides vascular supply within the pelvis and lower limb.  On this page:  Article: Summary Gross anatomy Variant anatomy Related articles References   Summary  origin: anterior division of the internal iliac artery  location: pelvis and lower limb  supply: pelvic muscles, ilium, head of femur, muscles of medial thigh, skin  branches: anterior and posterior branches, artery in the ligament of the femur, iliac branch, pubic branch, branch to the knee capsule Gross anatomyOriginThe obturator artery most often originates from the anterior division of the internal iliac artery. It travels along the obturator fascia of the pelvic sidewall, between the obturator nerve and vein, to reach the obturator foramen. It is crossed by the ureter close to its origin, and by the ductus deferens in the male.BranchesThe obturator artery has several branches which may be grouped as follows as branches in the pelvis and those within the thigh.Branches within the pelvis: the nutrient artery to the ilium supplies the iliac bone and iliacus muscle the pubic branch of the obturator artery anastomoses with the pubic branch of the inferior epigastric artery. It then travels through the obturator foramen with the obturator nerve passing into the medial compartment of the thigh.  Within the medial compartment of the thigh the obturator artery splits into anterior and posterior branches. These travel around the origin of the obturator externus and anastomose with one another and the medial circumflex femoral artery. the anterior branch supplies the adductor brevis muscle, and the skin over the medial thigh at its termination. the posterior branch gives another branch, the artery of the ligamentum teres which runs in the ligament of the head of the femur and eventually atrophies and becomes nonfunctional after approximately the age of seven. The posterior branch also supplies the adductor muscles and gives a small terminal branch to the capsule of the knee joint.  SupplyThe obturator artery supplies the pelvic muscles it crosses, the head of the femur, the muscles of the medial compartment of the thigh and gives a small branch to the knee capsule. The iliac branch supplies the bone and the iliacus muscle. It also has a cutaneous supply to the medial thigh.Variant anatomyThe obturator artery may be replaced by a large pubic branch of the inferior epigastric artery. Known as an accessory, or aberrant obturator artery, it may be present in approximately 20% of cases. This occurs when a large branch of the inferior epigastric artery descends into the pelvis along the usual path of the pubic branch of the obturator artery. Most often, it lies medial to the femoral ring. However, when it lies lateral to the femoral ring, its location predisposes to injury during femoral hernia repair.
__label__Musculoskeletal The obturator canal is a small opening in the superior aspect of the obturator foramen that connects the pelvis to the medial compartment of the thigh.

__label__Musculoskeletal The obturator foramen is the large, obliquely oriented, ovoid aperture located at the anterior aspect of both sides of the pelvis, bounded by parts of the ischium and pubis. It is covered by thin fibrous membrane, the obturator membrane, which is covered on the internal and external surfaces by the muscles obturator internus and obturator externus respectively. At its superior margin, the membrane is devoid forming the obturator canal which allows the obturator nerve, artery and vein to exit the pelvis and enter the medial compartment of the thigh.

On this page:  Article: Epidemiology Clinical presentation Pathology Radiographic features Treatment and prognosis History and etymology Differential diagnosis References   Images:Cases and figures  EpidemiologyTypically obturator hernias occur in older women 2,3 or patients with chronically raised intra-abdominal pressure (e.g. ascites, COPD, chronic cough) 3. They can occur in pregnancy, due to relaxation of the pelvic peritoneum and a wider and more horizontal obturator canal 3.  It has been suggested that there is a female predominance with this type of hernia, and they occur in less than 0.04% of all hernias 6. Clinical presentationIn general, obturator hernias are asymptomatic unless they 1: compress the obturator nerve: Howship-Romberg sign (only present in approximately half of cases) 3  contain bowel which incarcerates/obstructs/strangulates PathologyThe obturator foramen is occluded by the obturator membrane, which is pierced anterosuperiorly by the obturator artery, vein and nerve. This neurovascular bundle then travels along a 2-3 cm oblique tunnel, the obturator canal. It is through this deficiency that an obturator hernia occurs. Presumably, due to the sigmoid colon on the left, these hernias are more common on the right 3. The layers that the hernial neck passes through include:  obturator internus muscle fibers obturator membrane  obturator externus muscle fibers  The hernia will then lie superficial to obturator externus and deep and inferior to pectineus muscle.The hernia may contain any of the following: no more than peritoneum filled with fluid, as seen in patients with ascites   small bowel (most common)  colon 3  appendix omentum Meckel diverticulum  ovary/fallopian tube  and even uterus 3  Radiographic featuresThe diagnosis is readily made on CT/MRI with either fluid or bowel able to be traced along the aforementioned course to lie in the medial upper thigh.Signs of complication, including: bowel obstruction  strangulation resulting in perforation  Treatment and prognosisTreatment involves surgery and repair of the hernial orifice. History and etymologyHowship-Romberg sign is named for the German neurologist, Moritz Heinrich Romberg (1795-1873) 5, and British surgeon John Howship (1781-1841) 4.Differential diagnosisIf a hernia contains bowel or can be clearly traced through the obturator foramen, then there are very few alternative diagnoses.If seen with ultrasound, it may be mistaken for a bursa or acetabular labral cyst.
__label__Musculoskeletal The obturator internus muscle, like the piriformis muscle, is both a muscle of the pelvic wall and of the gluteal region.

__label__Musculoskeletal The obturator nerve is a large nerve arising from the lumbar plexus and the nerve of the medial compartment of the thigh. It arises from the anterior divisions of L2-4 in the lumbar plexus. Gross anatomyCoursePelvisThe nerve descends medial to psoas major to the obturator canal where it divides into anterior and posterior divisions. The anterior division exits from the obturator canal to enter the medial compartment of the thigh. The posterior division exits through obturator externus.Medial compartment of thighThe adductor brevis muscle separates the divisions of the obturator nerve:Anterior divisionBranches of the anterior division include: articular branch to hip joint adductor brevis adductor longus gracilis cutaneous branch: supplies skin along mid-portion of medial thigh Posterior divisionBranches of the posterior division supply: obturator externus  adductor magnus (pubic part) articular branch to knee joint: pierces oblique popliteal ligament Subsartorial canalBranch of the anterior division contributes to the subsartorial nerve plexus (near the insertion of adductor longus).Related pathologyInjury to the obturator nerve weakens hip adduction and contributes to instability. Irritation of the nerve may result in pain in the medial thigh/knee. Pathology can include direct trauma (i.e. childbirth) or pelvic pathology (i.e. tumor).Nerve entrapment can occur within the obturator canal or as the nerve pierces the obturator externus muscle. 
__label__Musculoskeletal Obturator nerve neuropathy is an entrapment neuropathy that occurs when the obturator nerve is compressed by surrounding structures. PathologyIt occurs as the nerve dives under the superior pubic ramus to enter the obturator foramen: the anterior division lies between adductor brevis, pectineus and adductor longus and the posterior division, between adductor brevis and adductor magnus.Etiology trauma  hip replacement complications (screws, cement) myositis ossificans pelvic tumors  obturator hernia: see Howship-Romberg sign   acetabular paralabral cyst 1

It is pierced by the foramen magnum, permitting communication from the cranial cavity to the vertebral canal. On this page:  Article: Terminology Gross anatomy Development Related articles References   Images:Cases and figures  TerminologyOcciput is a noun referring to the back of the head, it is not a synonym for the occipital bone. The occipital bone is also known as "C0" because it joins the skull to the first cervical vertebra or C1, forming the atlanto-occipital joint.Gross anatomyThe occipital bone is composed of four parts: squamous part: external/internal surfaces basilar part (basiocciput): lower/upper surfaces lateral (jugular) parts (two): under/upper surfaces The squamous part is the curved, expanded plate located behind the foramen magnum.The external surface of the squamous part features: external occipital protuberance, the tip is known as the inion  highest nuchal line superior nuchal line: occipitalis, trapezius, sternocleidomastoid, splenius capitis inferior nuchal line: rectus capitis posterior major and minor median nuchal line: attachment of ligamentum nuchae  attachment of posterior atlanto-occipital membrane The internal surface of the squamous part features: cruciate eminence divide region into four fossa; the upper two contain the occipital lobes while the lower two contain the cerebellar hemispheres internal occipital tuberosity at intersection sagittal sulcus for superior sagittal sinus, falx cerebri attaches to margins internal occipital crest gives attachment to falx cerebelli  transverse grooves hold transverse sinuses The basilar part is the quadrilateral piece in front of the foramen magnum.The lower surface of the basilar part features: pharyngeal tubercle: attachment to fibrous raphe of pharynx either side of middle line: longus capitis, and rectus capitis anterior anterior atlanto-occipital membrane The upper surface of the basilar part features: the clivus has a broad, shallow groove, for medulla oblongata lateral grooves for the inferior petrosal sinus  The under surface of the lateral part features: occipital condyles: articulate with the atlas (C1), permitting flexion and extension (nodding) with minimal lateral flexion.

__label__Spine __label__Musculoskeletal __label__Trauma Occipital condylar fractures are uncommon injuries usually resulting from high-energy blunt trauma. They are considered a specific type of basilar skull fracture, and importantly can be seen along with craniocervical dissociation.Treatment of isolated injury is generally conservative, unless there is craniocervical junction instability. On this page:  Article: Epidemiology Clinical presentation Mechanism Classification Radiographic features Treatment and prognosis Differential diagnosis Related articles References   Images:Cases and figures  Epidemiology relatively uncommonreported in 3-4% patients with moderate-severe traumatic brain injuries 3   mostly occur in the setting of high-energy trauma 5: motor vehicle collision (most common) fall from significant height reported, but uncommon 5: pedestrian trauma assault rarely with low-energy trauma, e.g. fall from standing in debilitated patient 5      may occur as isolated injury or with additional skeletal injuries 5+/- associated cervical spine fracture  may be bilateral 5  Clinical presentationHistory and examination are unreliable. A high suspicion should be maintained in patients presenting after blunt trauma with any of the following 3,6: loss of consciousness (low Glasgow coma score) occipital or neck pain (responsive patients) impaired craniocervical range of motion neurological deficit: lower cranial nerve palsy limb weakness vertigo diplopia   MechanismOccipital condyle fractures may result from blunt high-energy trauma to the head/neck, especially 3: axial compression lateral bending axial rotation direct blow Each occipital condyle articulates along a shallow groove atop each lateral mass of C1 (atlas). This articulation is directly stabilized by 7,8: atlanto-occipital joint capsule alar ligaments (dens to each occipital condyle) Injury to these ligaments may result in instability, particularly in the setting of additional injuries to the major craniocervical ligaments (occipitodental, atlantodental) 7.ClassificationThe classification system generally used for occipital condyle injuries is the Anderson and Montesano system, which divides injuries into three types based on morphology and mechanism of injury 1,2,9:  type I - comminuted (3-15%) impaction fracture of occipital condyle associated with axial compression injury stable injury    type II - basilar skull (25-50%) basilar skull fracture extending into occipital condyle associated with direct blow to lower skull stable injury    type III - avulsion (35-75%) condylar avulsion injury at the alar ligament attachment associated with forced contralateral bending and rotation potentially unstable injury   Since the Anderson and Montesano system is purely descriptive, a more clinically-oriented classification has been proposed by Tuli et al. The latter incorporates MRI findings, and is tiered according to suggested management 2,5:  type I - non-displaced fracture - may not require stabilization  type II - displaced fracture  IIA - no ligamentous instability, may require external stabilization  IIB - ligamentous instability, may require surgical fixation   Radiographic featuresThe role of imaging is foremost to evaluate for craniocervical dissociation or other catastrophic (e.g. spinal cord) injury, and then to identify and stratify all lesser craniocervical injuries.Plain radiographA lateral cervical spine radiograph is commonly obtained to screen for cervical spine injury in the setting of trauma. Occipital condyle fractures are rarely evident by x-ray 5,6.CTCT is the best modality for identifying an occipital condyle fracture 6. Fractures are best visualized on coronal and sagittal reformatted images.Important aspects of evaluation include: occipital condyle integrity comminuted fracture - suggests impaction curvilinear fracture fragment along medial condyle - suggests avulsion, possible ligamentous injury    atlanto-occipital articulation and atlanto-axial joint alignment - asymmetry in any plane suggests instability (ligamentous injury) joint spaces occipitoatlantal joint - should be <2 mm 9  atlantoaxial joint - should be <3 mm 5      evaluation for spinal canal narrowing evaluation for cervicomedullary or spinal hemorrhage other fractures skull base C1, C2   MRIMRI is commonly performed after a craniocervical injury is initially identified. The primary purpose is to exclude spinal cord injury, although other specific indications include: evaluate for suspected major ligamentous injury surgical treatment planning in setting of known instability high-suspicion patients who cannot be reliably examined within 48 hours - even with initial normal CT MR findings include: direct findings of condyle fracture cortical disruption, fragment displacement marrow edema   occipito-atlantal joint effusion effusion itself may be normal 5  joint space widening and hemorrhage (fluid-fluid level) are more specific for significant traumatic injury 2    alar ligament injury disruption, edema there may be additional adjacent ligamentous injuries, e.g. tectorial membrane, anterior and posterior atlanto-occipital membranes, prevertebral or nuchal ligaments 6    retrodental hemorrhage 6  The following limitations of MRI should be considered 5: CT generally is more sensitive for fracture CT better for assessing craniocervical alignments MR cannot exclude craniocervical instability limited sensitivity for ligament injury individual ligaments not often discernible   Treatment and prognosisThe most important factor in management of craniocervical junction injuries is the status of the stabilizing occipitoatlantoaxial ligaments.In the absence of obvious instability ligament disruption, most occipital condyle fractures are managed non-operatively with external stabilization 7. Isolated unstable fracture may be treated by posterior occipitocervical fusion 7.When considered according to Anderson and Montesano types, Type I and II injuries are generally stable because the alar ligament and tectorial membrane are preserved, while type 3 is potentially unstable.Non-surgical management typically results in mild residual impairment 8.Differential diagnosis  third condyle 4  ossification of ligament of odontoid process 2

__label__Head __label__& __label__Neck __label__Musculoskeletal Occipitalis muscle originates from tendinous fibers from the lateral two thirds of the superior nuchal line (of the occipital bone) and the mastoid part of the temporal bone and inserts into the epicranial aponeurosis. It is supplied by the posterior auricular and occipital arteries. It is innervated by the posterior auricular branch of the facial nerve. Occipitalis acts to draw the scalp posteriorly.
__label__Central __label__Nervous __label__System The occipital lobe is the smallest of the four lobes of the brain. It sits posterior to the temporal lobe and parietal lobes, underlying the occipital bone and overlying the tentorium cerebelli. Its most notable functional component is the primary and secondary visual cortex. On this page:  Article: Gross anatomy Relations Blood supply Neurological deficits Related articles References   Images:Cases and figures  Gross anatomyThe occipital lobe is the smallest lobe accounting for only 18% of the total neocortical volume 10. The boundaries of the occipital lobe have been arbitrarily defined, giving it a triangular shape 1. It is separated from the parietal and temporal lobes on the medial surface by the parieto-occipital sulcus and on the lateral side by the lateral parietotemporal line, a near vertical imaginary line extending from the preoccipital notch of the temporal lobe superiorly to the parieto-occipital sulcus. Medially, it is confined by the medial longitudinal fissure which divides both cerebral hemispheres. The tentorium cerebelli forms its inferior border and the occipital bone its posterior margin.Functional areasThe occipital lobe is concerned with visual processing and is composed of three Brodmann areas:  primary visual cortex (Brodmann area 17)  secondary visual (association) cortex (Brodmann areas 18 and 19) Sulci and gyriThe occipital lobe has a predictable medial gyral anatomy. medial surface (from superior to inferior) parieto-occipital sulcus cuneus  calcarine sulcussite of the primary visual cortex  lingual gyrus  collateral sulcusposterior segment, extending from temporal lobe 2   fusiform gyrus  The lateral surface of the occipital lobe is highly variable, reflected by the literature which is either vague or contradictory. As such, care must be taken in using specific anatomical terms as readers may have a different interpretation of the same anatomy. The simplest description, which conforms to the sulcal pattern found in the frontal and temporal lobes, unfortunately, is only present in approximately two-thirds of cases 1. When present the lateral surface is divided into three roughly parallel gyri (superior, middle and inferior occipital gyri) by two transverse occipital sulci (referred to as superior and inferior when both are present)1. Relations anterior: parietal lobe and temporal lobe  posterior: occipital bone superior: parietal lobe and parietal bone inferior: tentorium cerebelli  medial: transverse sinuses, torcula  Blood supplybranches of the posterior cerebral artery (PCA) 6 parieto-occipital artery calcarine artery posterior temporal artery common temporal artery/ temporo-occipital artery/ lateral occipital artery lingual gyrus arterynot found in all individuals   Neurological deficitsThe following neurological deficits occur with unilateral or bilateral lesions of the occipital lobes 11: deficits arising from unilateral lesions involving the dominant hemisphere: hemianopia: retrochiasmal lesion (lesions involving the optic tract, thalamic lateral geniculate nucleus, occipital lobe) color dysnomia: interruption of fibers streaming from the occipital cortex to the Wernicke's area    Anton syndrome: those who suffer cortical blindness but affirm quite adamantly that they are able to see   irritative lesions involving either lobe can give rise to the following: visual hallucinations (e.g. seeing flashes of light)

__label__Musculoskeletal __label__Central __label__Nervous __label__System Occipital neuralgia, also known as Arnold's neuralgia, is a neuralgic pain, similar to the better-known trigeminal neuralgia, but affecting the occipital nerves.  On this page:  Article: Terminology Epidemiology Clinical presentation Pathology Radiographic features Treatment and prognosis Differential diagnosis References   Images:Cases and figures  TerminologyThe term C2 neuralgia is often used synonymously with occipital neuralgia, and reasonably so as the greater occipital nerve is the most common cause of occipital neuralgia and is the medial branch of the dorsal ramus of C2 6. This is not truly a synonym, however, as occipital neuralgia can also be caused by C3 fibers traveling in the lesser occipital nerve or third occipital nerve (see below). As such, unless the cause of pain has been definitively localized to C2, the term occipital neuralgia is preferred. Occipital neuralgia is also distinct from occipital migraines that lack the short and paroxysmal episode of pain characteristic of neuralgias but instead have the longer-lasting multiple phases of migraines. EpidemiologyOccipital neuralgia is uncommon and perhaps somewhat more common in females 4. Clinical presentationOccipital neuralgia is characterized by sudden severe pain radiating from the occipital triangle, up into the posterior scalp 1. It is usually unilateral (85%) 1. Diagnosis can be confirmed by local anesthetic greater occipital nerve blockade; this can also be therapeutic 1. Unfortunately, the main differential diagnosis, occipital migraine, can have similar symptoms and can be ameliorated with occipital local anesthetic injections 1. Fronto-orbital pain may also be present due to connections between cervical nerves and the trigeminal nerve in the trigeminal spinal nuclei 7. PathologyPain can originate from the greater occipital nerve, lesser occipital nerve or third occipital nerve 1. The underlying cause, however, is uncertain and possibly varied. Possible causes that have been suggested include 1:  trauma e.g. whiplash structural compression by fascia or muscle bands by vascular loops   cord lesions In most cases, however, no clear cause is identified and the condition is then thought to be idiopathic 1. Radiographic featuresRadiographic imaging is of limited utility in the diagnosis of occipital neuralgia but is primarily concerned with excluding structural pathology of the cord, the spine, the occipital nerves or adjacent structures. As such, MRI is best suited to this task 1,4. UltrasoundThe greater occipital nerves can be identified on ultrasound and in cases of occipital neuralgia the affected nerve may be seen to be enlarged compared to the asymptomatic side 2.Treatment and prognosisTreatment can vary from oral therapy (e.g. tricyclic antidepressants or antiepileptics), injections (with local anesthetic with or without corticosteroids or Botulinum toxin), radiofrequency ablation or insertion of occipital nerve stimulators 1,4. Greater occipital nerve injection can be carried out under ultrasound or CT guidance 3. Differential diagnosisThe differential diagnosis of occipital neuralgia is with other primary headache disorders, particularly those that can have a posterior distribution. Considerations should include 1,4:  cluster headaches migraine  temporal arteritis (involving occipital artery) 
__label__Head __label__& __label__Neck Occipital plagiocephaly is a type of plagiocephaly. It is used to describe the shape of the skull which is a result of an early fusion of the lambdoid suture. The premature fusion may occur either on one side or both sides of the suture. On this page:  Article: Epidemiology Clinical presentation Radiographic features Treatment and prognosis See also References   Images:Cases and figures  EpidemiologyIt is one of the rarest craniosynostosis, accounting for ~3% of cases.Clinical presentationThe side which is involved appears flattened when it is viewed from above. Most often a bump is seen behind the ear on the ipsilateral side or the ipsilateral ear might be pulled backwards. However, if the ear is forward on the flat side (with respect to the opposite ear), and there is no reduction in skull height on the affected side, then a skull deformation should be suspected instead of a fused suture. It is critically important to determine whether or not a child truly has a fused suture because skull deformations almost never need to be surgically treated.Radiographic featuresRadiographThe Towne view is often used for evaluation. However, x-ray might at times give a deceptive appearance of a fused suture.CTIdeally, a CT should be performed for the same. Findings typically include: the absence of suture flattening over synostosed suture mastoid overgrowth resulting in bulge behind the involved ear temporoparietal bossing on opposite side Treatment and prognosisSurgical management of lambdoid synostosis involves restructuring the posterior fossa to provide adequate space for normal brain development as well as restoring normal symmetry.See also craniosynostosis positional plagiocephaly 
__label__Central __label__Nervous __label__System The occipital pole is an anatomical landmark that corresponds to the posterior portion of the occipital lobe. It is formed by the convergence of the superior and inferior occipital gyri in the majority of individuals; the middle occipital gyrus also contributes when it is present 1.Gross anatomyIt contains the part of the primary visual cortex (Brodmann area 17) representing the macular (central) vision. This posterior segment accounts for the majority of the primary visual cortex because of the disproportionate macular representation within the cortex 2; axons coming from the fovea and a 1 mm 3 area around it (representing the central 10 degrees and corresponding to ~2% of the total visual field) innervate ~60% of the primary visual cortex 2.Blood supplyThe vasculature of the occipital pole is unique in that it receives a dual blood supply, with anastomoses from the posterior cerebral artery (PCA) as well as the deep branch of the middle cerebral artery 4.Related pathologyLesions of the occipital pole result in a contralateral homonymous defect of macular vision (HMV) 4.The dual blood supply explains the phenomenon of a macula-sparing hemianopia that occurs with occlusion of the PCA in which the anterior portions of the primary visual cortex representing peripheral vision are affected while the occipital pole is spared. However, HMV is not as uncommon in PCA infarct as may be expected; a retrospective case-series of 54 patients with PCA infarcts found that of the 43 with visual field defects, 6 had HMV while 4 had macula-sparing hemianopia 4.

__label__Musculoskeletal __label__Spine Ochronosis, or alkaptonuria (AKU), is a rare multisystem autosomal recessive metabolic disorder.On imaging, the most particular presentation is on the spine, with osteoporotic bones and dense disc calcifications.  On this page:  Article: Terminology Epidemiology Clinical presentation Pathology Radiographic features Treatment and prognosis History and etymology Differential diagnosis See also References   Images:Cases and figures  TerminologyThe term ochronosis usually refers to the bluish-black discolouration of certain tissues, such as the ear cartilage and the ocular tissue, seen with alkaptonuria. Some authorities, however, refer to musculoskeletal manifestations of alkaptonuria as ochronosis 3.EpidemiologyThe estimated incidence is around 1:250,000-1,000,000 3,5.Clinical presentationPatients often have pigmentation of auricular cartilages and sclera. Urine color tends to be dark (at birth sometimes diagnosed by discolouration of diapers). Up to 25% of patients with alkaptonuria do not have the characteristic dark urine staining; many patients remain undiagnosed until adulthood.PathologyThe condition results due to excessive build-up of homogentisic acid (HGA) from a lack of homogentisic oxidase (a defect in the biochemical pathway for the degradation of phenylalanine and tyrosine). The excess HGA binds to collagen in connective tissue. The affected connective tissues become weak and brittle with time, leading to chronic inflammation, degeneration, and osteoarthrosis (progressive arthropathy). Genetics A defective gene has been mapped to chromosome 3q21–q23 5.Radiographic featuresPlain radiographThe most well-described features are those involving the skeletal system. Vertebral severe osteoporosis multilevel intervertebral disc calcification: tends to be widespread (and involves nucleus pulposus) syndesmophyte formation multilevel disc space narrowing Joints symmetrical or asymmetrical joint space loss: early osteoarthritis  subchondral sclerosis chondrocalcinosis Treatment and prognosisThere is currently (as of February 2018) no effective treatment for ochronosis.Complications  aortic stenosis 4  spontaneous tendon ruptures have been reported 3  History and etymologyOchronosis was defined by Virchow, who histologically described the connective tissue in alkaptonuria, given the cartilage's ochre (yellow) hue under the microscope.Differential diagnosisFor skeletal radiographic manifestations consider: calcium pyrophosphate deposition disease (CPPD): mainly extravertebralThere is a broad differential for intervertebral disc calcification.See alsopolyarticular arthropathy
__label__Gastrointestinal __label__Paediatrics __label__Chest Octreotide scintigraphy uses 111In-labeled octreotide which is a somatostatin analog; it is also known as an OctreoscanTM, a brand name for 111In-labeled pentetreotide; pentetreotide is a DTPA-conjugated form of octreotide, originally manufactured by Mallinckrodt Nuclear Medicine LLC, which now forms part of Curium). The radiotracer is characterized by a high affinity of bond with the somatostatin receptor 2 (SST2). It penetrates inside the cell by endocytosis, first held by lysosomes and then transferred to the nucleus 4,5.It is particularly useful for assessment of neuroendocrine tumors, and the Krenning Score is used to grade these, most commonly for peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT) planning. Examples include: carcinoid tumor  paraganglioma glomus jugulare tumor glomus jugulotympanicum glomus vagale glomus tympanicum carotid body tumor pheochromocytoma   small cell lung cancer pituitary adenoma neuroblastoma medullary thyroid carcinoma pancreatic islet cell tumor Certain non-neuroendocrine tumors can also show uptake in an octreoscan. Examples include: meningioma astrocytoma breast carcinoma lymphoma  Merkel cell carcinoma 3  Also, certain autoimmune or granulomatous diseases (for example sarcoidosis) may occasionally show octreotide uptake by overexpression of somatostatin receptors 6-8.

__label__Head __label__& __label__Neck __label__Central __label__Nervous __label__System The ocular globes or simply, the eyes are paired spherical sensory organs, located anteriorly on the face within the orbits, which house the visual apparatus. On this page:  Article: Gross anatomy Relations Arterial supply Venous drainage Innervation Eye movements Variant anatomy Radiographic features Development Related pathology Related articles References   Images:Cases and figures  Gross anatomyLocationThe globe is suspended by the bulbar sheath in the anterior third of the bony orbit. SizeEach globe is an approximately spherical structure and 25 mm in diameter 2. StructureThe surface of the globe is made up of three layers, the outermost fibrous layer, the intermediate vascular layer, and the innermost neural layer. This trilaminar structure brings about a further subdivision of the eye into two major segments; the anterior segment, which contains aqueous humor, and the posterior segment, which contains the gel-like vitreous humor. Both of these substances allow diffusion of nutrients to adjacent structures and act to maintain the shape of the globe.The fundus of the globe refers to the retina, optic disc, macula and fovea collectively, and hence funduscopy/fundoscopy (alternative spellings: both acceptable).Fibrous layerThe fibrous layer of the globe is made up of the opaque sclera and the transparent cornea. The sclera makes up the posterior 5/6 of the fibrous layer and provides structure and protection to the globe, as well as serving as a point of insertion to the extraocular muscles. The cornea makes up the protruding anterior 1/6 of the fibrous layer. The cornea owes its transparent clarity to both the structural arrangement of the collagen and its constant, relatively dehydrated state 1. The point where the sclera and cornea are continuous is the sclerocorneal junction or the limbus.Vascular layerThe vascular layer of the globe is made up of the uvea, which is comprised from anterior to posterior of the iris, ciliary body and choroid: the iris is a pigmented muscular structure located deep to the cornea, with radially arranged dilator pupillae muscles, and concentrically arranged sphincter pupillae muscles; these muscles dilate and constrict the pupils in response to sympathetic (from long ciliary nerve), and parasympathetic nerve impulses (from CN III), respectively the ciliary body is a muscular structure, with a globular medial aspect from which the zonule fibers originate, to tether to the lens; posterolaterally, the ciliary body is flattened and extends to the ora serrata 1, where it is continuous with the choroid, about halfway to the equator of the globe the choroid is the darkly pigmented vascular portion of the uvea, continuing posteriorly along the wall of the globe, to give blood supply to the neural layer of the globe Neural layerThe neural layer of the globe is made up of the retina, which extends over the insertion of the optic nerve, around the walls of the globe, deep to the choroid; to the ora serrata, where it fades. The retina is a multilayered structure: the deepest layer is the melanin-rich retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), (from which it can be detached); the RPE continues to line the inner aspects of the uveal tract deep to this are layers of neuronal structures, including the pigment cells, rods and cones, bipolar cells, horizontal cells, and ganglion cells, whose long axons extend from the retina, through the optic nerve, and ultimately to synapse at the lateral geniculate body of the thalamus 1  The retina has a number of important areas: the optic disc corresponds to the entry point of the optic nerve, and the physiological blindspot the macula lutea is the yellow colored area located temporally to the disc and the fovea centralis is the small avascular region located in the central depression of the macula that is involved in sharp color vision Segments and chambers the anterior segment of the eye is bounded by the cornea anteriorly and the lens posteriorly; the anterior segment is further divided into two chambers that communicate via the pupil the anterior chamber, which lies between the cornea and the iris; the point at which they meet containing the drainage apparatus of the anterior segment, the canal of Schlemm and the posterior chamber, which lies between the iris and the lens; both of these areas are filled with aqueous humor   the posterior segment is bounded anteriorly and posteriorly by the hyaloid membranes, and is filled with gel-like vitreous humor, which is involved in maintaining the position of the retina and the shape of the globea fluid-filled, fibrous structure known as the hyaloid canal projects from the posterior aspect of the lens to the center of the optic disc  Relations anterior: bulbar sheath, episcleral space, conjunctiva, conjunctival fornices, eyelids posterior: optic nerve, extraconal compartment of the orbit  lateral:  lateral rectus  medial: medial rectus  superior: superior rectus, superior oblique  inferior: Inferior rectus, inferior oblique  superolateral:  lacrimal glands  inferomedial: nasolacrimal duct  Arterial supplyArterial supply to the globe is provided by multiple arteries, all of which are branches of the ophthalmic artery (from the internal carotid artery):  central retinal artery is the major vessel of the retina long posterior ciliary arteries supply the iris, ciliary body and anterior aspect of the choroid short posterior ciliary arteries supply the posterior aspect of the choroid Venous drainageVenous drainage of the globe is via the vorticose veins (a.k.a. vortex veins) of the choroid and the central retinal vein, which drain into the superior ophthalmic vein and inferior ophthalmic vein, and ultimately the cavernous sinus.Medial veins of the face drain via facial-cavernous anastomoses that communicate via the ophthalmic veins.InnervationThe globe receives its sensory innervation from the long ciliary nerves and short ciliary nerves (branches of the nasociliary nerve from the ophthalmic division of the trigeminal nerve). The visual special sensory function of the eye is supplied by the optic nerve. Eye movementsThe six extraocular muscles control eye movement from their common origin at the annulus of Zinn.Variant anatomyVariations in the size of the globe, as well aberrant connections between the extraocular muscles have been described 4; variants such as these may bring about congenital refractive errors such as myopia and hyperopia, or may be incidental findings on imaging: persistent hyperplastic primary vitreous (PHPV) persistent hyaloid artery congenital globe protrusion congenital glaucoma Radiographic featuresMultiple features can be demonstrated in the globe, through a variety of modalities:Ultrasound the cornea and iris appear as thin echogenic lines; with the anechoic aqueous humor intervening posteriorly on the cornea, and on either side of the iris 7  the lens is defined by biconvex echogenic boundaries, with an anechoic interior area the vitreous humor is anechoic, with increasing frequency of linear and spot echoes, as a result of the aging process 7  although the retina, choroid and sclera do not produce echoes, together these structures appear as a posteriorly concave surface, outside of which, an echogenic area extending from the cornea to the location of the optic disc 7  the optic nerve appears hypoechoic in contrast to the surrounding echogenic fat 7  CT lens and ciliary bodies appear dense in comparison to the fluids of the anterior and posterior segment 5  aqueous and vitreous humor appear isodense despite marked differences in their viscosity 5,6  MRI the cornea and sclera appear hypointense on both T1W and T2W images, however, the cornea may be accentuated by a hyperintense tear film in T1W 5,6  the lens appears hypointense on both T1W and T2W images 6. the uveal tract appears hyperintense on T1W, and hypointense on T2W the retina is not easily distinguished from the choroid in the absence of pathological detachments or contrast enhancement 5,6  because the choroid and ciliary body enhance strongly with IV gadolinium 5    both the aqueous and vitreous humor are hypointense on T1W and hyperintense on T2W 6  DevelopmentThe globes develop during the third week of embryonic life and are completed by week ten. Both the vascular and fibrous layers of the eye are derived from the mesoderm, with the exception of the iris. The iris, along with the entire neural layer of the globe, originates from the neural ectoderm, whereas the lens develops from surface ectoderm of the anterior cranium 8.Hyaloid canal and arteryDuring embryological development, the hyaloid canal is the pathway of the hyaloid artery which supplied the lens and retina, and involutes prior to birth 8. If there is a persistent hyaloid artery, however, this can lead to visual impairment and hemorrhages in the posterior compartment.Related pathologySclera/cornea globe rupture staphyloma osteogenesis imperfecta ocular foreign body scleritis senile calcific scleral plaques orbital foreign body Iris/pupil coloboma Argyll Robertson pupil Adie pupil Hutchinson pupil Marcus Gunn pupil neurosyphilis Ciliary body/lens lens dislocation aphakia cataract lenticonus Uvea primary uveal malignant melanoma uveal metastasis Choroidchoroidal detachmentVitreous humorvitreous hemorrhageRetina retinal detachment photopsia Optic nerve optic disc drusen papilledema optic nerve meningioma optic nerve glioma optic nerve enlargement Vascular central retinal vein occlusion central retinal artery occlusion

__label__Central __label__Nervous __label__System __label__Head __label__& __label__Neck The oculomotor nerve is the third of the cranial nerves and arises from the midbrain. It is responsible for the movements of four of the six extraocular muscles, the other two being innervated by the trochlear and abducens nerves.Gross anatomyNucleus and cisternal portionThe oculomotor nucleus lies in the deep periaqueductal grey matter at the level of the superior colliculus anterior to the cerebral aqueduct. The fibers run through the tegmentum, red nucleus and medial aspect of the substantia nigra to emerge from the medial aspect of the cerebral peduncle into the interpeduncular cistern. The nerve then travels forwards, below the posterior cerebral artery (where it can be compressed by a posterior communicating artery aneurysm) and above the superior cerebellar artery, before piercing the dura mater and entering the cavernous sinus.Cavernous sinus portionWithin the cavernous sinus the oculomotor nerve is located uppermost, above the trochlear nerve in the lateral wall of the sinus.Orbital portionIt enters the orbit via the superior orbital fissure as two branches: superior division and inferior division, with the nasociliary nerve (a branch of the ophthalmic division of the trigeminal nerve) between them and the abducens nerve (CN VI) below all three. These four branches pass through the tendinous ring.Superior divisionThe superior division, the smaller of the two, runs above the optic nerve and gives branches to superior rectus and levator palpebrae superioris muscles which it supplies with motor fibers. Additionally, it also supplies the latter with sympathetic fibers derived from the internal carotid artery.Inferior divisionThe inferior division supplies the inferior rectus, medial rectus (this branch passes below the optic nerve), and the inferior oblique. It also gives off the parasympathetic root to the ciliary ganglion.Related pathologyoculomotor nerve palsy

__label__Musculoskeletal __label__Trauma O'Donoghue unhappy triad or terrible triad often occurs in contact and non-contact sports, such as basketball, football, or rugby, when there is a lateral force applied to the knee while the foot is fixated on the ground. This produces an abduction-external rotation mechanism of injury ("pivot shift" in non-contact sports).PathologyThe O'Donoghue unhappy triad comprises three types of soft tissue injury that frequently tend to occur simultaneously in knee injuries. O'Donoghue described the injuries as: anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tear  medial collateral ligament (MCL) tear/sprain medial meniscal tear (lateral compartment bone bruise)  The triad has subsequently been revisited considering the arthroscopic findings in patients with both ACL and MCL injuries, where a lateral meniscal injury is more common than injury to the medial meniscus 2. Mechanistically this makes more sense during the pivot shift movement, as the lateral tibiofemoral compartment is compressed, causing failure of the lateral meniscus.History and etymologyThe unhappy triad is named after D H O'Donoghue, American orthopedic surgeon, who described it in 1950 4.
__label__Head __label__& __label__Neck Odontogenic keratocysts (OKC), previously known as keratocystic odontogenic tumors (KCOT or KOT), are benign cystic lesions involving the mandible or maxilla and are believed to arise from dental lamina. Whether these lesions are developmental or neoplastic is controversial, with the 2017 WHO classification placing it back into the development lesion category. They are locally aggressive and tend to recur after excision. On imaging, they typically appear as an expansile solitary unilocular lesion extending longitudinally in the posterior portions of the mandible. Although the majority are solitary, in 5-10% of cases multiple KOTs will be present: an associated condition such as basal cell nevus syndrome should be considered in these cases. On this page:  Article: Epidemiology Clinical presentation Pathology Radiographic features Treatment and prognosis History and etymology Differential diagnosis See also Related articles References   Images: Cases and figures Imaging differential diagnosis   EpidemiologyPredominantly in younger patients (2nd-3rd decades) 1,7 and may be seen in either the body or ramus of the mandible (~70% of all keratocystic odontic tumors), or maxilla comprising 5-10% of all jaw cysts. There may be male predilection.Clinical presentationCommonly discovered incidentally. When symptomatic, jaw swelling and pain are a common symptoms associated with these tumors 8. Less commonly, trismus and paraesthesia may occur.PathologyGross specimen examination reveals a thin-walled, friable cyst containing fluid and debris. Viscosity of the contents ranges from straw-colored fluid to purulent and cheese-like masses.They originate from epithelial cell rests (stratified squamous keratinizing epithelium) found along the dental lamina and periodontal margin of the alveolus of the mandible 7. Inflammation may impede histologic characterization.Associations  basal cell nevus syndrome (or Gorlin-Goltz syndrome) strong association consider the diagnosis if multiple KOTs are present   Marfan syndrome Noonan syndrome Radiographic featuresPlain radiographOPGThey are typically seen as a solitary, radiolucent, unilocular, expansile lesion with smooth, corticated borders 5. These cortices are often scalloped around the roots of teeth. Three-quarters of lesions are located in the posterior mandible. When in the mandible, they typically grow along the length of the bone with minimal buccolingual expansion. In the maxilla, they expand into the maxillary sinus. They average 3 cm in size.The appearance and location can vary 10. If associated with the crown of an unerupted/impacted tooth, they can mimic a dentigerous cyst. If associated with the roots of a non-vital tooth, they can mimic a radicular cyst. If large enough, they will resorb the roots of adjacent teeth. They may occasionally appear septated, making the distinction from ameloblastoma difficult. CTReminiscent of plain radiographic findings, but in better detail. Visualized as an expansile, cystic lesion with scalloped, well-corticated borders. Density of cystic contents varies with viscosity. Cortical breach suggests possible soft tissue involvement.MRIKeratocystic odontogenic tumors will typically demonstrate 3:  T1: high signal due to cholesterol and keratin contents  T2: heterogeneous signal  DWI: restricts due to presence of keratin  T1 C+: peripheral enhancement but unlike ameloblastomas no enhancing nodular component Treatment and prognosisThey are locally aggressive.

__label__Head __label__& __label__Neck Odontogenic sinusitis describes inflammation of the maxillary sinus secondary to dental pathology or dental procedures. On this page:  Article: Epidemiology Clinical presentation Pathology Radiographic features References   Images:Cases and figures  EpidemiologyOdontogenic sinusitis accounts for 5-70% of cases of chronic maxillary sinusitis. It is the most common cause of unilateral maxillary sinusitis 6.Clinical presentationSinusitis is a clinical diagnosis that relies on the presence of signs and symptoms such as facial pain/pressure/fullness, mucopurulent nasal drainage, nasal congestion/obstruction, and reduction in sense of smell. To establish a diagnosis of chronic sinusitis, these symptoms should be present longer than 12 weeks despite attempts at medical management. Dental pain in odontogenic sinusitis can occur but is often absent. Patients who have imaging evidence of sinus mucosal inflammation are not necessarily symptomatic.PathologyOdontogenic sinusitis results from the spread of infection or inflammation from the teeth to the maxillary sinus via perforation of the sinus floor and disruption of the Schneiderian membrane.EtiologySources vary as to whether iatrogenic causes or dental pathology are more common causes of odontogenic sinusitis 4. They can be classified as the following 3:Iatrogenic causes:  oroantral communication/fistula following tooth extraction sinus lift procedure foreign body (e.g. dental restoration, root canal fillings, misplaced roots) Non-iatrogenic causes: periapical inflammatory pathology/apical periodontitis (most common) marginal periodontitis, usually with severe vertical bone loss combined endodontic-periodontic pathology LocationThe tooth of origin is nearly always one of the maxillary molars or premolars, most commonly involving the first or second molars 4.Radiographic featuresCTThe most common finding that supports, but does not establish, a diagnosis of odontogenic sinusitis is mucosal thickening in the inferior maxillary sinus (>2 mm is abnormal, >10 mm is marked/severe). Unilateral and isolated maxillary sinus opacification should raise the possibility of an odontogenic cause.Multiplanar evaluation of the maxillary molars and premolars and surrounding bone should be undertaken to identify a source, such as periapical lucency, periodontal bone loss, oroantral fistula, and exogenous dental reconstructive/restorative material.

As such, the types of esophageal atresia / tracheo-esophageal fistula can be divided into 4: proximal atresia with distal fistula: 85% isolated esophageal atresia: 8-9% isolated fistula (H-type): 4-6% double fistula with intervening atresia: 1-2% proximal fistula with distal atresia: 1% See main article: esophageal atresia classification.AssociationsEsophageal atresias are frequently associated with various other anomalies (50-75% of cases). They include other intestinal atresias duodenal atresia jejunoileal atresia anal atresia   annular pancreas pyloric stenosis  VACTERL association inclusive of congenital cardiac anomalies  CHARGE syndrome increased incidence of chromosomal anomalies such as trisomy 21 trisomy 18   Radiographic featuresPlain radiographChest x-ray: may show a dilated pharyngeal pouch the presence of air in the stomach and bowel in the setting of esophageal atresia implies that there is a distal fistula if an esophagogastric (feeding) tube insertion has been attempted this may show the tube blind looping and turning back at the upper thoracic part of the esophagus or heading into the trachea and/or bronchial tree FluoroscopyContrast swallow may show contrast blindly ending and pooling in an esophageal stump and/or may show evidence of the tracheo-esophageal fistula. Fluoroscopy is particularly useful in demonstrating H-type fistula. A withdrawal esophagogram is performed for a H-type fistula. The patient is positioned prone and a horizontal beam is used, contrast material is injected through the nasogastric tube into the distal esophagus while the tube is slowly withdrawn under fluoroscopy 8. If the imaging study fails to locate the fistula while there is high suspicion then combined bronchoscopy and esophagoscopy is used 8. The gap between esophageal pouches is determined by inserting a Higer dilator through gastronomy into the distal esophagus and Repogle tube into proximal pouch; both tubes are radiopaque 8. Antenatal ultrasound non-specific but may not show the expected shape and position of the stomach should be suspected if other VACTERL anomalies are seen  polyhydramnios may be present particularly in cases where there is no concurrent fistulation the fetus may appear growth restricted   the subtypes without a tracheo-esophageal fistula may be suspected in the context of persistent non-visualization of the fetal stomach  CThas been trialled for 3D detailed visualization of anatomy but not part of routine investigation 3 Treatment and prognosisSurgical intervention with a re-anastomosis can be attempted post delivery. The prognosis is variable dependent on other associated anomalies. Esophageal strictures secondary to surgical correction of esophageal atresia is a known complication of the procedure and usually requires further surgical correction.

__label__Chest __label__Gastrointestinal __label__Oncology Esophageal carcinoma is relatively uncommon. It tends to present with increasing dysphagia, initially to solids and progressing to liquids as the tumor increases in size, obstructing the lumen of the esophagus. On this page:  Article: Epidemiology Clinical presentation Pathology Radiographic features Complications Treatment and prognosis Differential diagnosis Related articles References   Images: Cases and figures Imaging differential diagnosis   EpidemiologyEsophageal cancer is responsible for <1% of all cancers and 4-10% of all gastrointestinal malignancies. There is recognized male preponderance with the squamous cell subtype, M:F 4:1. Blacks are more susceptible than Caucasians, 2:1.The incidence of the subtypes has regional variation. The squamous cell subtype has the greatest worldwide incidence (~90%), but the adenocarcinoma subtype is more common in many parts of North America and Europe. In addition, there are certain regions where individuals are at particularly high risk of developing esophageal cancer, e.g. Iran, parts of Africa, Italy and China.Predisposing factors include 8:  alcohol and smoking: for squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma achalasia asbestosis  Barrett esophagus: for adenocarcinoma celiac disease ionizing radiation caustic stricture/lye stricture Plummer-Vinson syndrome obesity: for adenocarcinoma history of oral or pharyngeal cancer  human papilloma virus (HPV)  tylosis (Howel–Evans syndrome): rare AD disease with hyperkeratosis of palm and sole with a high incidence of esophageal cancer Clinical presentationPatients present with progressive dysphagia, weight loss, chronic worsening gastroesophageal reflux and hoarseness, cough, vocal cord paralysis, or other signs and symptoms of mediastinal invasion.PathologyHistological types  squamous cell carcinoma of esophagus: 81-95% (worldwide)  adenocarcinoma of esophagus: 4-19% (worldwide) arising from mucosal/submucosal glands, heterotopic gastric mucosa, or columnar-lined epithelium >90% related to Barrett esophagus  tend to occur at the gastro-esophageal junction     other types mucoepidermoid carcinoma  adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC) spindle-cell squamous carcinoma  leiomyosarcoma rhabdomyosarcoma  fibrosarcoma  malignant lymphoma     * in western world adenocarcinoma is as common or even slightly more common than squamous cell carcinomaMacroscopic appearance polypoid/fungating (most common) sessile/pedunculated tumor lobulated surface protruding irregular, polycyclic, overhanging, step-like "apple core" lesion   ulcerating: large ulcer niche within a bulging mass infiltrating: gradual narrowing with a smooth transition superficial spreading carcinoma StagingSee the separate articles by histology: esophageal and esophagogastric junction adenocarcinoma (staging) esophageal and esophagogastric junction squamous cell carcinoma (staging) esophageal and esophagogastric junction neuroendocrine tumor (staging) Metastases lymphatic anterior jugular chain and supraclavicular nodes (primary in upper 1/3) para-esophageal and subdiaphragmatic nodes (primary in middle 1/3) mediastinal and paracardial and celiac trunk nodes (primary in lower 1/3)   haematogenous: lung, liver, adrenal glands Radiographic featuresA combination of CT scan, transesophageal ultrasound and PET/CT scan are used for staging of the disease. CT is the best initial modality for detection of the distant metastasis, gross direct invasion, and enlarged lymph nodes. Ultrasound is the most sensitive modality for assessment of the depth of invasion and regional enlarged lymph nodes. PET can be useful for re-staging after the initial neoadjuvant therapy 7. Chest radiographMany indirect signs can be sought on a chest radiograph and these include: widened azygo-esophageal recess with convexity toward right lung (in 30% of distal and mid-esophageal cancers) thickening of posterior tracheal stripe and right paratracheal stripe >4 mm (if tumor located in the upper third of esophagus) tracheal deviation or posterior tracheal indentation/mass retrocardiac or posterior mediastinal mass esophageal air-fluid level lobulated mass extending into gastric bubble (Kirklin sign) repeated aspiration pneumonia (with tracheo-esophageal fistula) Fluoroscopy/Barium Swallow irregular stricture pre-stricture dilatation with 'hold up' shouldering of the stricture Endoscopic USIt is the most accurate imaging modality for the T staging of esophageal cancerIt defines the layers of the esophageal wall hence can differentiate T1, T2, and T3 tumorsThe esophagus consists of five layers. the first hyperechoic layer represents the interface between the balloon and the superficial mucosa.  the second hypoechoic layer represents the lamina propria and muscularis mucosae.  the third hyperechoic layer represents the submucosa  the fourth hypoechoic layer represents the muscularis propria the fifth layer represents the interface between the adventitia and surrounding tissues CT eccentric or circumferential wall thickening >5 mm peri-esophageal soft tissue and fat stranding dilated fluid- and debris-filled esophageal lumen is proximal to an obstructing lesion tracheobronchial invasion appears as a displacement of the airway (usually the trachea or left mainstem bronchus) as a result of mass effect by the esophageal tumor aortic invasion FDG PET/CTPET/CT is useful for detecting esophageal primary tumors yet it has little role in helping determine the specific T classification because it provides limited information about the depth of tumor invasion.PET/CT is also superior to CT for detecting lymph node metastases and can depict metastases in normal-sized lymph nodes through the uptake of FDG. PET/CT has a primary role in the depiction of distant sites of metastatic disease.The most common sites of distant metastases detected at PET (but frequently missed at CT) are the bones and liver. Complications fistula formation to the trachea (5-10%), bronchi or mediastinum: can be either due to direct tumor progression or iatrogenic effects (e.g. radiation therapy)  esophageal perforation Treatment and prognosisThe 5-year mortality depends on the stage of the tumor. Unfortunately, most cases present with regional or distant metastatic disease (30% and 40%, respectively. localized disease: ~40% 5-year survival distant metastatic disease: ~5% 5-year survival Endoscopic mucosal resection, without or with localized ablation is an option for localized (T1a) disease. These epithelial tumors are usually <2 cm, asymptomatic, and noncircumferential.For T1b tumors and above, surgical options are mostly limited to esophagectomy (including sometimes with palliative colonic interposition (see case 19))Differential diagnosisImaging differential considerations include: benign tumors of the esophagus esophageal leiomyoma esophageal leiomyomatosis   non-malignant conditions (e.g. diffuse inflammation)

__label__Chest __label__Gastrointestinal Duplication of the esophagus has a range of macroscopic appearances from complete (very rare) to partial cystic duplication (esophageal duplication cyst). It is the second most common gastrointestinal tract duplication after that of the ileum. On this page:  Article: Epidemiology Clinical presentation Pathology Radiographic features Differential diagnosis Related articles References   Images: Cases and figures Imaging differential diagnosis   EpidemiologyA complete duplication is a rare malformation and is also often associated with a gastric duplication (also rare). A partial duplication is more common. As a congenital abnormality, it is usually identified soon after birth, if symptomatic.Clinical presentationPresentation of large duplication cysts usually occurs in the newborn or infant, with symptoms referable to pressure on the adjacent lung or esophagus, leading to: respiratory difficulties dysphagia vomiting Smaller cysts can be asymptomatic and are usually found incidentally at imaging. PathologyThe duplicated segment has a thick wall of smooth muscle and is lined with alimentary tract mucosa. The lining mucosa may be the same as that in the segment it parallels, or may be similar to the mucosa lining some other portion of the alimentary tract - frequently, gastric mucosa, in which case peptic ulceration of the duplication is a common finding.Radiographic featuresMost often, duplications are spherical cysts that rarely make an impression on the esophagus and are usually located in the right hemithorax.Plain radiographOn plain chest radiographs, they are usually seen as rounded fluid / soft tissue density posterior mediastinal masses.FluoroscopyIn cystic esophageal duplication, the esophagogram shows the esophagus to be displaced to the side opposite the mass (i.e. contralaterally).CTDuplication cysts appear as sharply marginated masses with homogeneous fluid density. No enhancement is visible after intravenous contrast administration.MRIMRI demonstrates features of a cyst. Signal characteristics therefore include:  T1: low signal  T2: high signal  T1 C+ (Gd): no solid enhancement Differential diagnosisFor a partial cystic duplication consider any posterior or middle mediastinal mass, including:  neoplasms arising from the sympathetic chain: ganglioglioma, ganglioneuroma, etc  bronchogenic cyst the distinction between this entity and esophageal duplication cysts is often impossible on imaging alone, and can only be settled by obtaining histology, which is not normally done furthermore, in asymptomatic patients the distinction is of no real clinical relevance   pericardial cyst neurenteric cyst pulmonary sequestration anterior meningocele hemangioma

__label__Gastrointestinal Esophageal dysmotility refers to the pathological disruption of the normal sequential and coordinated muscle motion of the esophagus to transport food from the oropharynx to the stomach. It is an umbrella term used to refer to the common pathophysiological endpoint of dysmotility that can be caused by various disorders, which subsequently have a common mode of presentation. On this page:  Article: Epidemiology Clinical presentation Pathology Radiographic features Related articles References   Images:Cases and figures  EpidemiologyThe incidence of motility disorders involving the esophagus is poorly defined. Achalasia (an uncommon cause of esophageal dysmotility) is said to have an approximate incidence of 1-3 per 100,000 in the USA 1.Clinical presentationDysphagia and chest discomfort are common modes of presentation. Characteristically the dysphagia seen in motility disorders tends to involve both solids and liquids at the outset. Retrospective studies have reported dysphagia lasting up to six years at presentation. Associated dyspepsia, globus, and weight loss may also be present. Depending on the underlying cause, certain features can be more prominent than others, for example: progressive solid and liquid dysphagia with chest pain as an early featureachalasia  chest pain or dyspepsia as the prominent symptom, which may be unrelated to dysphagiaesophageal spasm  features of severe acid reflux including dyspepsia, regurgitation, and dysphagiascleroderma  PathologyMost primary esophageal dysmotility disorders tend to be idiopathic, though various infectious, genetic, and autoimmune mechanisms have been proposed. The exception to this is achalasia, which has a defined pathophysiology.Secondary causes essentially relate to the involvement of the esophagus is systemic disease such as scleroderma or as a consequence of significant gastro-esophageal reflux disease.Radiographic featuresPlain radiographPatients with esophageal dysmotility can be referred for chest x-rays when the dominant feature is chest pain or if there is a cough related to co-existing gastro-esophageal reflux.Chest radiographs can have non-specific findings but may show a dilated esophagus with a sigmoid appearance in achalasia. A hiatus hernia may be noted.FluoroscopyContrast swallow examinations are commonly used to assess the esophagus since they provide both anatomical and functional information. This is at times correlated with endoscopic and manometry findings if possible intervention is being considered. If fluoroscopy is unremarkable but the patient remains symptomatic, these tests can be pursued for clarification.Common findings depending on the cause include:  achalasia dilated intrathoracic esophagus air-fluid level bird beak or rat's tail appearance with tapering of the distal esophagus towards to lower esophageal sphincter    diffuse esophageal spasm corkscrew or rosary bead appearance possible pseudodiverticula    scleroderma slightly dilated esophagus reduced or absent peristalsis free gastro-esophageal reflux    gastro-esophageal reflux free gastro-esophageal reflux mucosal changes of erosive esophagitis

__label__Gastrointestinal __label__Vascular __label__Chest The esophageal hiatus is the opening in the diaphragm through which the esophagus passes from the thoracic to abdominal cavity. It is one of three apertures in the diaphragm and is located in the right crus.It is situated in the muscular part of the diaphragm at the level of T10 and is elliptical in shape. It is located above, in front and a little to the left of the aortic hiatus, slightly to the left of midline. The vena caval foramen is located to its right (right of midline) and marginally anterior to it.It transmits several structures including the esophagus: esophagus vagus nerves small esophageal arteries The vertebral levels of the 3 main diaphragmatic apertures can be remembered by this mnemonic.
__label__Chest __label__Interventional __label__Gastrointestinal Esophageal intubation refers to the incorrect placement of an endotracheal tube in the esophagus. Within minutes its consequences can be catastrophic with the seriousness of its outcome depending largely on the timeliness of its diagnosis. On this page:  Article: Epidemiology Clinical presentation Radiographic features Treatment and prognosis Differential diagnosis Related articles References   Images:Cases and figures  EpidemiologyAccidental esophageal intubation can happen with any experienced anesthesiologist. It is more common with difficult intubations and in the emergency setting. In the critical care setting, esophageal intubation occurs in 8% of total intubation attempts 1.Clinical presentationEsophageal intubation is traditionally considered a clinical rather than a radiological diagnosis. Common clinical tests recommended for confirming correct endotracheal tube placement include 2: visualization of the endotracheal tube passing through the vocal cords auscultation of the chest and epigastrium observation of chest movement If any of these tests are not consistent with correct endotracheal tube placement, there should be a high suspicion for esophageal intubation.The Australian and New Zealand Committee on Resuscitation (ANZCOR) recommend that physical examination should be used with wave form capnography to confirm endotracheal tube placement as the gold standard 2.  Radiographic featuresPlain radiographProjection of the endotracheal tube tip being lateral or posterior to the trachea is a sure sign of malpositioning and likely esophageal intubation 3. As the esophagus is leftwardly-displaced in most patients, a right posterior oblique view or turning the head to the right can increase the accuracy of the diagnosis 3,4.While it is possible for the diagnosis to be made with a standard portable anterior-posterior film, it has proved to be difficult and unreliable, owing to the endotracheal tube often projecting over the tracheal air column 3.Esophageal air and gastric distension (especially in the presence of a nasogastric tube) can also suggest esophageal intubation 3.UltrasoundThe role of ultrasound in confirming endotracheal tube placement is a relatively novel idea. Studies have demonstrated that it has a sensitivity and specificity that rivals that of the current ANZCOR gold standard 5-7. The major advantage of ultrasound is that, unlike physical exam or wave capnography, it does not require lung ventilation or pulmonary blood flow which is particularly important in resuscitation scenarios 7,8.Transtracheal scanning is performed with the transducer being placed transversely over the suprasternal notch 7. In this view, the trachea can be identified as a hyperechoic air-mucosa interface with comet tail artefact. Esophageal intubation is defined as when a second air-mucosa interface appears, often posterolateral to the trachea. This finding seems to suggest a second false airway and is therefore referred to as the “double tract sign” 7.Transthoracic or intercostal scanning has also been shown to be an effective tool for detecting esophageal intubation 6. In this view, bilateral absence of the “lung sliding sign” would suggest esophageal intubation.Treatment and prognosisEsophageal perforation is the most serious complication and should be evaluated for on plain film 3.Differential diagnosisFor ultrasound appearances, consider:local anatomical variants owing to previous neck trauma, neck tumors, previous surgery or tracheotomy

On this page:  Article: Epidemiology Clinical presentation Pathology Radiographic features Differential diagnosis References   Images:Cases and figures  EpidemiologyThey may account for approximately 0.4% of the benign tumors of the alimentary tract 1. There may be greater male predilection. The average age of presentation is around 50 years. Clinical presentationThey are usually small, asymptomatic and incidentally detected. When large (>3 cm), patients may present with symptoms such as dysphagia, regurgitation, odynophagia, epigastralgia or hemorrhage.PathologyAs with all lipomas, they are composed entirely of mature adipocytes with or without mesenchymal tissue elements. There exists a variety of histological subtypes which include spindle cell lipoma, angiolipoma, myolipoma, fibrolipoma, myxoid lipoma, and the common classic lipoma. Some lesions may be pedunculated.LocationIn terms of location, they most commonly occur in the upper one-third of the thoracic esophagus but can potentially occur anywhere from the pharynx to the distal esophagus. Radiographic featuresFluoroscopy (barium swallow)They can appear as smooth intraluminal filling defects. Some may be pedunculated. CTCT characteristically demonstrates a homogeneous fat attenuation in typical lesions.MRIFollows fat signal with a high T1 weighted intensity that becomes low intensity on fat-suppressed images.Differential diagnosisPossible differential considerations include liposarcoma arising from the esophageal region: it can be usually differentiated from liposarcoma which appears as a heterogeneous lesion with internal septations and soft tissue components without fat attenuation.For atypical lesions consider other esophageal lesions such as esophageal fibrovascular polyp esophageal leiomyoma esophageal carcinoma

__label__Gastrointestinal Esophageal myotomy (or Heller myotomy) is a procedure that can be performed to treat a lower esophageal sphincter that fails to relax (e.g. achalasia). The procedure involves a longitudinal incision of the distal esophageal musculature to break the sphincter tone.A fundoplication wrap can be performed to restore some patency to the lower esophageal sphincter. A section of the gastric fundus is wrapped around the gastro-esophageal sphincter to mechanically apply some tone to the junction. There are several variations, including Nissen fundoplication: the gastric fundus is passed behind the distal 6 cm of the esophagus and a 360° wrap is performed by pulling some of the fundus anteriorly as well and attaching the two ends anteriorly Toupet fundoplication: Similar to a Nissen, but a 270° wrap Dor fundoplication: the fundus is pulled anteriorly <180° A more recent technique of per-oral esophageal myotomy (POEM) is increasing in use in some centers.Radiographic featuresFluoroscopyOn contrast swallow examination, there may be characteristic "ballooning" of the distal esophagus after a myotomy (50%), as the esophagus bulges through the myotomy 3-4.History and etymologyThe first successful cardiomyotomy for achlasia was performed by the German surgeon Ernest Heller in 1913 5.

Subcutaneous emphysema may also be present 4. PathologyThe lack of a serosal layer may make the esophagus more susceptible to injury than other parts of the gastrointestinal tract 3. Etiology iatrogenic post instrumentation or post thoracic surgery (most common ~80% of cases) 3,4  complication of acute radiation-induced esophagitis    trauma: both blunt (crush-type injury) and penetratingoccurs in <0.1% of blunt chest trauma 2   foreign body ingestion corrosive material ingestion esophageal cancer spontaneous rupture post vomiting (Boerhaave syndrome) Radiographic featuresPlain radiographPossible clues on chest radiographs include:  pneumomediastinum, abnormal cardiomediastinal contour, pneumothorax and pleural effusion are all features, although non-specific, for esophageal perforation 5  widening of the mediastinal shadow: non-specific on its own Fluoroscopy most sensitive within the first 24 hours 1  patient examined semi-supine (~20 degrees) on the fluoroscopy table a water-soluble agent should be used initially as barium can cause mediastinitis  esophageal perforation may be represented as mucosal irregularity or gross extraluminal contrast extravasation some authors suggest the use of small amounts of low or high concentrations of barium if no leak is evident on initial screening with water-soluble contrast 8  CTThe role of CT is usually to look for stigmata of perforation when fluoroscopy is equivocal, and there is persisting suspicion of perforation. These include: extraluminal gas locules in the mediastinum or abdominal cavity, adjacent to the esophagus are highly suggestive 2,4   pleural or mediastinal fluid pneumomediastinum or pneumothorax pericardial or pleural effusions can be seen Water-soluble oral contrast can be administered 20 minutes before scanning to demonstrate extravasation. Intravenous contrast is usually administered to delineate the esophageal wall (25 - 60-second delay) 8.Treatment and prognosisThere is a high mortality rate, estimated between 25 to 50% in some series 1,4 and this is significantly increased if the diagnosis is delayed beyond 24 hours 6.The rarity of this condition means that treatment is not well established and options include surgical or endoscopic management vs. medical management 5,6. Complications acute mediastinitis 2,3   esophagopleural fistula 2,3   pneumonia 2,3   empyema 2,3  sepsis 2,3

__label__Gastrointestinal __label__Interventional Esophageal stents are a treatment option in patients with esophageal strictures. It is most commonly used for symptomatic relief in those with dysphagia secondary to malignancy. The stent is typically covered in nature and inserted endoscopically or fluoroscopically. The distal esophagus is the most common site. Most stents inserted are self expandable. On this page:  Article: Procedure Complications History and etymology Related articles References   Images:Cases and figures  ProcedureThere are several types of stents, which include self expandable stents: ultraflex stent wall stent Z stent ComplicationsProblems associated with stents include: pain bleeding: a small amount of hematemesis can be common especially with self expandable metal stents 2  stent slippage/migration tumor overgrowth  esophageal perforation (rarely) History and etymologySomewhat surprisingly the word 'stent' is actually an eponym, originally named after Charles Stent (1807-1885), a largely-forgotten British dentist. He invented an improved material for forming dental impressions, and set up a company to manufacture it. During the Great War, J F Esser, a Dutch surgeon used a mold of Stent's Compound as a fixative for skin grafting in injured infantrymen. This innovative use, was rapidly adopted into practice, and stenting as a concept rapidly segued into multiple specialties.
__label__Chest __label__Gastrointestinal Esophageal stricture refers to any persistent intrinsic narrowing of the esophagus.  On this page:  Article: Pathology Radiographic features Treatment and prognosis Related articles References   Images:Cases and figures  PathologyEtiologyThe most common causes are fibrosis induced by inflammatory and neoplastic processes. Because radiographic findings are not reliable in differentiating benign from malignant strictures, all should be evaluated endoscopically. Upper and middle esophageal stricturesThese most commonly result from: Barrett esophagus mediastinal radiation caustic ingestion congenital esophageal stenosis esophageal intramural pseudodiverticulosis skin diseases associated with mucosal ulceration, such as  pemphigoid erythema multiforme epidermolysis bullosa dystrophica   Distal esophageal stricturesThese are typically caused by gastro-esophageal reflux disease (GERD), either as a separate entity or in the setting of: scleroderma prolonged nasogastric intubation  Zollinger-Ellison syndrome: high acidity reflux post partial or total gastrectomy: alkaline refluxperforming the roux-en-Y procedure may avoid this, by diverting the pancreatic secretions and bile away from the gastric remnant  AssociationsEsophageal strictures are often associated with a hiatal hernia.Radiographic featuresBenign strictures characteristically: smoothly tapering typically concentric narrowing, but may affect only one side of the esophagus (asymmetric wall rigidity) Malignant strictures are characteristically: abrupt asymmetric eccentric with irregular, nodular mucosa Tapered margins may occur with malignant lesions because of the ease of submucosal spread of a tumor.Treatment and prognosisThe risk of Barrett esophagus in stricture is 20-40% and strictures should be evaluated endoscopically.     Benign esophageal strictures are typically treated with dilation, providing symptomatic relief, however recurrent strictures do occur. Complex strictures (length >2 cm, tortuous) are more likely to be recurrent. Treatment of malignant strictures involves treating the underlying cause. In palliative strictures, stent placement and brachytherapy play a role 4. 
__label__Vascular __label__Hepatobiliary __label__Gastrointestinal Esophageal varices describe dilated submucosal veins of the esophagus, and are an important portosystemic collateral pathway. They are considered distinct from gastric varices, which are less common. On this page:  Article: Epidemiology Clinical presentation Pathology Radiographic features Treatment and prognosis See also References   Images:Cases and figures  EpidemiologyEsophageal varices are present in ~50% of patients with portal hypertension 1,2. They occur in greater frequency in patients with more severe cirrhosis, for example esophageal varices may be present in ~40% of patients with Child-Pugh A, but in ~85% of patients with Child-Pugh C cirrhosis 1,2.Clinical presentationPatients will generally be asymptomatic until a variceal hemorrhage, which occur at a yearly rate of 5-15% 1,2. In the case of a variceal bleed, patients will usually present with stigmata of upper gastrointestinal bleeding, such as hematemesis, melena, presyncope and syncope, and progression to hypovolemic shock 1,2. The primary predictor of variceal bleed is variceal wall tension, which is a metric that encompasses vessel diameter (larger is worse) and pressure (higher is worse) 1,2.Additionally, patients will often have stigmata of portal hypertension and cirrhosis – the most common etiological basis for esophageal varices.PathologyTwo types of esophageal varices have been described. uphill esophageal varices most common form 1-4  typically caused by portal hypertension, as a collateral pathway between the portal vein and the superior vena cava (via the azygos vein) 1,2the most common cause of this phenomenon is cirrhosis 1-4, however less common non-cirrhotic etiologies include primary biliary cirrhosis, primary sclerosing cholangitis, portal vein thrombosis, Budd-Chiari syndrome, and schistosomiasis 5   typically present in the lower third of the esophagus 1-4  commonly co-occur with gastric varices, which have an identical pathophysiology, but are notably less common 1,2when co-occurring, most commonly there is extension of the esophageal varices along the lesser curvature of the stomach (Type GOV1 in the Sarin classification) 1   may be associated with paraesophageal varices, which are varices of the adventitial esophageal veins, and confer a low bleeding risk 6,7     downhill esophageal varices relatively rare 3,4  typically caused by superior vena cava obstruction, as part of superior vena cava syndrome, as a collateral pathway between the superior vena cava into the portal circulation and/or the inferior vena cava 3,4  typically present in the upper third of the esophagus, although can span the entire esophagus if the superior vena cava obstruction is proximal to the inflow of the azygos vein 3,4  do not co-occur with gastric varices due to a different pathophysiological basis 3,4  have a relatively lower bleeding risk 3,4    Radiographic featuresThe gold-standard investigation for the evaluation of esophageal varices is esophagogastroduodenoscopy, however radiographic investigations may serve as a useful non-invasive adjunct.Plain radiographEsophageal varices may be visible on plain radiograph if they are large. In such instances, they will have a non-specific appearance of a mass in the posterior mediastinum 8.FluoroscopyBarium swallow may reveal longitudinal esophageal luminal filling defects, representing esophageal varices 6.CT/MRIEsophageal and paraesophageal varices are readily visible on contrast-enhanced cross-sectional imaging, as torturous, enlarged, smooth enhancing tubular structures 6,9. They, depending on size and pressure, may protrude into the esophageal lumen 6,9. In association, the esophageal wall is also often thickened 6,9.DSADigital subtraction angiography can also be a useful imaging modality in the assessment of esophageal and paraesophageal varices, providing direct visualization through catheterization and contrast injection of the left gastric vein 6,10. However, smaller varices are often not appreciated 6,10.Treatment and prognosisThe mainstay of management for uphill esophageal varices is primary prevention, which can be pharmacological (typically with non-selective beta-blockers), or with invasive endoscopic variceal ligation 1,2,11. The decision between pharmacological or endoscopic prevention is rather complex, and depends on factors such as variceal size and severity of cirrhosis 1,2,11. In patients with a prior variceal hemorrhage, the focus of management is secondary prevention, which can again be pharmacological (typically with non-selective beta-blockers), with invasive endoscopic variceal ligation, or through surgical creation of a portosystemic shunt (e.g. transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt) 1,2,11.In the event of acute variceal hemorrhage, management includes resuscitation with intravenous fluids and blood products, administration of vasoactive drugs (such as terlipressin or octreotide), intravenous antibiotics, and endoscopic ligation 1. In severe cases refractory to standard management, salvage therapy with a Sengstaken-Blakemore tube or a Minnesota tube can be attempted 11.The management of downhill esophageal varices is quite different, and the focus is on treating the cause of the superior vena cava obstruction 3,4. Unlike uphill esophageal varices, beta-blockade may not be useful, however endoscopic variceal ligation or banding may be appropriate 3,4.See alsoportosystemic collateral pathway

__label__Gastrointestinal Esophagectomy is a surgical procedure that involves excision of the majority of the esophagus and part of the proximal stomach, usually as a treatment for esophageal carcinoma or carcinoma of the gastric cardia, although benign conditions (e.g. stricture) may - rarely - be treated with this approach.Esophagectomies are usually classified as either: transthoracic esophagectomy: more complete oncologic approach, higher pulmonary complication (each procedure requires a thoracotomy) and anastomotic leak risk Ivor Lewis procedure McKeown procedure left thoracoabdominal approach   transhiatal esophagectomy There are also different types of esophageal interposition: gastric pull-up (most common) colonic interposition jejunal interposition ComplicationsThese surgeries are technically demanding and have a high complication rate.

The distal thoracic esophagus then curves anteriorly to pass through the diaphragm into the abdominal cavity. The lower esophageal sphincter, also known as the phrenic ampulla or the esophageal vestibule, represents a 2-4 cm long dilatation between the A-ring and B-ring 6.There are three normal esophageal constrictions that should not be confused for pathological constrictions: cervical constriction: due to cricoid cartilage at the level of C5/6 thoracic constriction: due to aortic arch at the level of T4/5 abdominal constriction: at esophageal hiatus at T10/11 Relations posteriorly: vertebral column; descending aorta; thoracic duct (at thoracic plane); accessory hemiazygos and hemiazygos veins (at T8/9) anteriorly: trachea (to T4/5); recurrent laryngeal nerves (in tracheo-esophageal groove); left main bronchus; left atrium  left lateral: lung; pleura; aorta; left subclavian artery; thoracic duct right lateral: lung; pleura; azygos vein  Arterial supply upper third: inferior thyroid artery  middle third: esophageal branches of the thoracic aorta  lower third: esophageal branches of the left gastric artery  Venous drainage upper third: inferior thyroid veins to brachiocephalic veins  middle third: azygos vein to SVC  lower third: left gastric vein to portal vein (site of portal-systemic collateral pathway) Lymphatic drainageFollows arterial supply: upper third: deep cervical lymph nodes middle third: posterior mediastinal lymph nodes lower third: left gastric and celiac group lymph nodes Innervation sympathetic trunk (sympathetic fibers) vagal plexus (parasympathetic fibers) HistologyThe esophagus is made up of five layers noting there is no serosal layer: outer longitudinal muscularis propria inner circular muscularis propria (in the upper 1/3 of the esophagus this layer is composed of striated (voluntary) muscle while the lower 2/3 is smooth muscle) submucosa muscularis mucosae mucosastratified squamous epithelium that abruptly changes to columnar epithelium in the lower esophagus  Variant anatomy esophageal bronchus esophageal atresia  aberrant right subclavian artery passing anterior or posterior to the esophagus Radiographic appearanceBarium swallow modified barium swallow used to evaluate pharyngeal motility during swallowing, the procedure utilizes barium of varying consistencies given by mouth with video recording of swallowing  barium swallow is the main radiological method of assessing the esophagus.

__label__Central __label__Nervous __label__System The O'Kelly-Marotta (OKM) grading scale is a proposed method of assessing the degree of angiographic filling and contrast stasis in the setting of intracranial aneurysms treated by endovascular flow diversion. Taking into account the dynamic nature of the contrast stasis, it is designed for use with cerebral angiography to predict aneurysm closure over time 1.ParametersA digital subtraction angiogram involving arterial injection and extending completely into the venous phase is necessary for accurate grading.Two variables are addressed, namely the degree of aneurysm filling and the timing of contrast clearance.Aneurysm filling A: total filling (>95%)  B: subtotal filling (5-95%) C: entry remnant (<5%) D: no filling (0%) Stasis phase 1: no stasis (arterial phase clearance, before capillary phase) 2: moderate stasis (clearance before venous phase) 3: significant stasis (persistent contrast at venous phase) Important points ten possible scores exist (i.e. A1, A2, A3, B1, B2, B3, C1, C2, C3, and D) as the absence of filling by definition precludes the observation of different phases of stasis the OKM scale should be applied to both pre- and post-treatment cerebral angiography the scale has been shown since its inception to demonstrate a high degree of inter- and intraobserver agreement 2

__label__Musculoskeletal The olecranon bursa (plural: bursae) is a bursa located in the subcutaneous tissue that overlies the olecranon process of the proximal ulna. The floor of the bursa lies on the triceps brachii tendon and olecranon, while the roof is in contact with the overlying subcutaneous tissue 1. It is a thin-walled sac lined with synovium that under normal circumstances contains only a very small amount of fluid 2. DevelopmentThis bursa develops between the age of 7 to 10 1,3 and its function is to create a frictionless motion between the triceps brachii tendon and olecranon process deep to the bursa and the soft tissue superficial to it during elbow motion.Related pathologyIn response to direct trauma, infection, repetitive insult or inflammatory disorders (e.g. gout, rheumatoid arthritis, pseudogout) the bursa can become inflamed causing olecranon bursitis.

__label__Musculoskeletal __label__Trauma Olecranon fractures are clinically and radiographically obvious, and usually require open reduction and internal fixation. On this page:  Article: Mechanism Radiographic features Reporting checklist Treatment and prognosis Differential diagnosis Related articles References   Images:Cases and figures  MechanismOlecranon fractures occur as the result of one of four mechanisms 2: direct blow (or fall directly on the elbow) fall on outstretched hand with elbow flexed  avulsion fracture - e.g. triceps bony avulsion   stress fracture, e.g. throwing athletes and gymnasts It is important to remember that the ulnar nerve is closely related to the medial aspect of the olecranon and, although not common, nerve injury may complicate these fractures 2.Radiographic featuresPlain radiographOlecranon fractures are easy to diagnose provided a lateral x-ray of the elbow is obtained. They appear as a lucency usually reaching the trochlear groove articular surface and are, in most cases, displaced.Reporting checklistRadiology reports should not only include whether or not a fracture is present but also comment on: fracture location, especially whether or not it reaches the articular surface  displacement and the gap distance comminution   associated findings and relevant negatives presence of fracture of the coronoid process  presence of fracture or dislocation of the radial head  presence of fracture of the distal humerus   Treatment and prognosisDue to the unopposed traction of the triceps muscle, these fractures are usually widely displaced and require open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) 1. Occasionally when undisplaced non-operative treatment with immobilization at 30 degrees of flexion is possible 2. Union rates with appropriate treatment are very high (~99%) and other than a slight reduction in flexion and extension at the elbow, function is preserved 1,2.Unlike many other intra-articular fractures, olecranon fractures result in relatively little secondary osteoarthritic changes, probably on account of most fractures occurring through a relatively non-articular part of the trochlear groove 1.Most of the symptoms relate to prominence of hardware given the little overlying soft tissues 1.Occasionally ulnar nerve injury can result in long-term sensory and motor impairment, most marked in the hand.Differential diagnosisThere is usually little differential, especially in adults, and when the clinical presentation is that of trauma to the elbow with pain, swelling and lack of mobility. In young patients, one must consider unfused olecranon epiphysis 3. Extremely rarely it can mimic a patella cubiti.
__label__Musculoskeletal Olecranon stress fractures are one of the three types of fractures that may occur in the olecranon in throwing athletes.

Occasionally, gomenol was added to the paraffin oil for anti-bacterial activity 1. Usually, the oil was removed after 18-24 months, however, many asymptomatic patients were lost to follow-up and never had the oil removed 1,3.ComplicationsPossible complications can occur after many years, including expansion of the oleothorax causing respiratory distress, rupture of the oleothorax causing paraffin oil aspiration, bronchopleural fistula, and super-imposed infection (including empyema) 1,3.Radiographic featuresOleothorax is often noted incidentally, and are described as large dense apical lentiform calcified opacities with accompanied pleural thickening seen on plain chest radiograph 1-3. The appearance has a differential diagnosis of an old calcified empyema, hemothorax with calcification, or mesothelioma and other pleural lesions 1,3.
__label__Head __label__& __label__Neck The olfactory fossae or grooves of the cribriform plate are shallow depressions located within the ethmoid bone in the anterior cranial fossa that contains the olfactory bulb of the olfactory nerve. The floor is formed by the medial lamella of the cribriform plate, bordered laterally by the lateral lamella and medially by the perpendicular plate.The depth of the olfactory fossa is determined by the length of the lateral lamellae of the cribriform plate. The Keros classification is a means of classifying the depth of the olfactory fossa, as this area of thin bone is at risk during endoscopic nasal surgery.Contents olfactory bulb  anterior ethmoidal artery  
__label__Central __label__Nervous __label__System The olfactory nerve (CN I) is the first and most rostral of the cranial nerves. Along with the optic nerve, it is actually a peripheral outpost of the central nervous system.The bipolar cell is the first-order sensory neuron located in the roof of the nasal cavity, immediately inferior to the cribriform plate of the ethmoid bone. This cell is analogous to the sensory cells of spinal nerves, whose cell bodies reside in the dorsal root ganglion. Their central processes form filaments (approximately 20) which pass through the cribriform plate, pierce the dura mater and relay in the olfactory bulb, the expanded anterior portion of the nerve that sits in the olfactory fossa. The central process of these second-order neurons forms the olfactory nerve which passes posteriorly within the olfactory groove of the anterior cranial fossa and then in-between the gyrus rectus medially and medial orbital gyrus laterally.Anterior to the anterior perforated substance, they form medial and lateral olfactory striae. The lateral olfactory striae project to the uncus. The medial olfactory striae ultimately project to the hypothalamus and brainstem nuclei. Coronal images are the best to depict the olfactory nerve as it is situated deep in the olfactory groove.
__label__Head __label__& __label__Neck __label__Central __label__Nervous __label__System Olfactory neuroblastomas, also known as esthesioneuroblastomas, (the spelling aesthesioneuroblastoma is archaic) are tumors arising from the basal layer of the olfactory epithelium in the superior recess of the nasal cavity.They usually present as a soft tissue mass in the superior olfactory recess involving the anterior and middle ethmoid air-cells on one side and extending through the cribriform plate into the anterior cranial fossa. Contrast enhancement is often marked in both CT and MRI studies.  On this page:  Article: Epidemiology Clinical presentation Pathology Radiographic features Treatment and prognosis Differential diagnosis Related articles References   Images: Cases and figures Imaging differential diagnosis   EpidemiologyThere is bimodal age distribution with one peak in young adult patients (~2nd decade) and another peak in the 5th to 6th decades. There is no recognized gender predilection.Clinical presentationClinical presentation is usually secondary to nasal stuffiness and rhinorrhea or epistaxis. Presentation is often delayed and symptoms may have been present for many months. Patients often present late with larger tumors which can extend into the intracranial compartment (25-30% at diagnosis) and usually result in anosmia 2,3,7.PathologyOlfactory neuroblastomas are of neural crest cell origin 1. Macroscopically, they are multilobulated pink-grey tumors.Histology demonstrates variable differentiation, from well-formed neural tissue to undifferentiated neuroblasts with pseudorosette formation 2. It has been suggested that olfactory neuroblastoma is actually part of the Ewing sarcoma group of tumors, rather than being related to neuroblastoma 5.StagingSee: olfactory neuroblastoma stagingRadiographic featuresThe tumors are slow growing and the choice of imaging will depend on the tumor's size. They begin as masses in the superior olfactory recess and initially involve the anterior and middle ethmoid air-cells unilaterally 1,2. As they grow, they tend to destroy surrounding bone and can extend in any direction. Often they are said to form a "dumbbell-shaped" mass with a "waist" as it passes through the cribriform plate 8.This invasion may be superiorly into the anterior cranial fossa, laterally into the orbits and across the midline into the contralateral nasal cavity. They can also obstruct the ostia of paranasal sinuses, resulting in opacification of the sinus with secretions 2.Particular attention should be paid to the presence of cervical and retropharyngeal nodal metastases, which are present in 10-44% of cases at diagnosis 6. CTCT is particularly useful in assessing bony destruction, although it cannot distinguish olfactory neuroblastomas from other tumors that arise in the same region 2. The mass is of soft tissue attenuation, with relatively homogeneous enhancement 3. Focal calcifications are occasionally present 3. These tumors are relatively slow-growing and thus, bony margins are often remodelled and resorbed, rather than being aggressively destroyed 3.MRISignal characteristics include:  T1: heterogeneous intermediate signal  T2: heterogeneous intermediate signal  T1 C+ (Gd): variable enhancement (usually moderate to intense) 3,7  When an intracranial extension is present, peritumoural cysts between it and the overlying brain are often present. This may be helpful in distinguishing it from other entities (see below) 3,7. The margins of these cysts sometimes enhance 7. Angiography/DSAAngiography demonstrates a prominent tumor blush with arteriovenous shunting and persistent opacification.Nuclear medicineAs with other neuroblastomas, olfactory neuroblastomas are MIBG-avid. This potentially helps to differentiate them from other tumors that arise in the region 1.Treatment and prognosisTreatment usually involves combined chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy with surgical excision. Prognosis is significantly affected by the presence of distant metastases (see olfactory neuroblastoma staging). no distant metastases: 60% 5-year survival 6  distant metastases: 0% 5-year survival Small localized tumors have a high cure rate, up to 85-90% 7.Differential diagnosisUnfortunately, imaging alone often struggles to distinguish between olfactory neuroblastomas and other aggressive malignancies in the region.

__label__Central __label__Nervous __label__System The olfactory sulcus is located on the inferior (orbital) surface of the frontal lobe and runs in an anteroposterior direction. The gyrus rectus lies medial to the olfactory sulcus, whilst the orbital gyri lie lateral to it. The olfactory tract runs within the olfactory sulcus 1-3.
__label__Head __label__& __label__Neck __label__Central __label__Nervous __label__System The olfactory system transmits smell from detection of odorants at the olfactory epithelium in the nasal cavity to the primary olfactory cortex.  It is phylogenetically the most ancient sensory tract and terminates on primitive cortical areas.Gross anatomyPrimary olfactory neurons are bipolar with the distal processes sensing airborne chemicals coming into contact with the olfactory mucosa and the proximal processes projecting to the olfactory bulb. These proximal processes pass through the cribriform plate of the ethmoid bone on their way to synapsing with the olfactory bulb. The olfactory nerve (CN I) refers to the sensory fibers (formed from the primary olfactory neurons) passing between the olfactory mucosa and the olfactory bulb. The olfactory nerves are the shortest cranial nerves in the body. It should be noted that the olfactory bulb and tract are themselves a projection of the central nervous system and are frequently incorrectly considered part of the olfactory nerve.The olfactory bulb and tract pass through in the olfactory sulcus on the orbital surface of the frontal lobe. These tracts synapse at the primary olfactory cortex which includes the anterior olfactory nucleus (AON), amygdala, olfactory tubercle, piriform cortex and rostral entorhinal cortex.The piriform cortex is by far the largest of these and is located on the uncus of the parahippocampal gyrus. It is thought to project via the medial dorsal nucleus of the thalamus to the orbitofrontal cortex where conscious discrimination of smell can occur.Differences from other sensesIt has two major differences from other sensory modalities. First, it is the only sensory modality which is not relayed to the thalamus prior to synapsing at the cortex. Second, the cortical olfactory areas are part of the evolutionarily older allocortex compared with the neocortical regions processing other sensations. 
__label__Central __label__Nervous __label__System Oligoastrocytomas (OAs) are intracranial tumors that are part of the glial cell continuum, with mixed oligodendroglial and astrocytic cell populations and typically occur in young adults. The literature is somewhat conflicted on these entities, with imaging appearance and incidence varying widely. As of the latest (2016) update to the WHO classification of CNS tumors, their incidence will be greatly reduced 8.   On this page:  Article: Epidemiology Clinical presentation Pathology Radiographic features Treatment and prognosis Related articles References   Images: Cases and figures Imaging differential diagnosis   EpidemiologyHistorically these tumors have in some institutions been encountered commonly, in some instances accounting for 50% of all oligodendrogliomas and considered the third most common glial neoplasm 2. However, it is not possible to infer a reliable incidence of oligoastrocytomas due to the vague criteria for their definition and wide interobserver variability 6.The peak manifestation is during the 3rd and 4th decades 1.Clinical presentationOligoastrocytomas most commonly present with either partial or generalized seizures 7.PathologyOligoastrocytomas are WHO Grade II and anaplastic oligoastrocytomas are WHO Grade III.Malignancy histologic features such as high cellularity, pleomorphism, nuclear atypia, and increased mitotic activity are usually found in the anaplastic oligoastrocytomas. Necrosis and microvascular proliferation may also be present but are not required for the diagnosis 1.As of the latest (2016) update to the WHO classification of CNS tumors, their incidence will be greatly reduced as the diagnosis will require molecularly distinct populations of both components to be identified: astrocytic (IDH-mutant, ATRX-mutant, 1p19q-intact) and oligodendrogliocytic (IDH-mutant, ATRX-wildtype, 1p19q co-deleted) 8. Radiographic featuresOn imaging, they have appearances that are essentially indistinguishable from their constituent tumors. There are no specific features to help separate oligoastrocytomas, astrocytomas and oligodendrogliomas. CTUsually presented as an intra-axial low-attenuation area with little to no associated edema.MRI  T1: usually hypointense  T2: usually hyperintense   T1 C+ (Gd): usually non-enhancing lesions  Treatment and prognosisOligoastroctyomas respond less favourably to chemotherapy due to the chemoresistance of their astrocytic component 4. Studies have shown that the standard of care for oligodendroglial tumors that are 1p19q codeleted should be the combination of chemotherapy and radiation therapy 5.A favourable prognosis is found in those with young age, WHO III, and better extent of resection 3.

__label__Central __label__Nervous __label__System Oligodendrogliomas are intracranial tumors that account for 5-25% of all gliomas and 5-10% of all primary intracranial neoplasms.On imaging, oligodendrogliomas commonly present as masses involving the cortex or subcortical white matter, with low attenuation on CT, hypointense compared to grey matter on T1 and hyperintense compared to grey matter on T2-weighted MRI images. The attenuation or signal can be eventually heterogeneous due to calcification, cystic degeneration and hemorrhage. On this page:  Article: Terminology Epidemiology Clinical presentation Pathology  Radiographic features Treatment and prognosis Differential diagnosis References   Images:Cases and figures  TerminologyHistorically, oligodendrogliomas have been defined on histological grounds. As of 2016, however, with the update to the WHO classification of CNS tumors the diagnosis of oligodendroglioma is made by identifying a diffuse infiltrating glioma with IDH mutation and 1p19q codeletion 9. This is a very significant change, as the tumors previously diagnosed as oligodendrogliomas on the grounds of histology, and those currently diagnosed on the basis of the molecular markers are not identical, with different imaging features. As such it is essential when reading about gliomas to ascertain which definition is being used. As a general rule, anything written before 2016 will use histology alone. The reliance on molecular markers is, however, not foolproof. Sometimes molecular markers are unavailable (in many countries or regional centers) or sometimes equivocal. In such instances, the diagnosis reverts to histological features alone, and are termed Not-Otherwise-Specified (NOS) 9. Clearly, as the two groups are not the same, this is creating problems when interpreting the literature.The WHO classification of CNS tumors, therefore, recognizes four diagnoses related to oligodendrogliomas 9:  oligodendroglioma (WHO grade II): IDH-mt, 1p19q co-deleted  anaplastic oligodendroglioma (WHO grade III): IDH-mt, 1p19q co-deleted  oligodendroglioma NOS (WHO grade II): IDH and 1p19q indeterminate  anaplastic oligodendroglioma NOS (WHO grade III): IDH and 1p19q indeterminate In addition, oligoastrocytomas are also recognized but discussed separately. EpidemiologyOligodendroglioma is considered the third most common glioma accounting for 2%–5% of primary brain tumors and 5%–18% of all glial neoplasms 8. Oligodendrogliomas are usually tumors of middle-aged adults, occurring most commonly in the 4th and 5th decades of life 10. They are rare in children 10. There is a slight male predilection (M:F 1.3:1) 10. Clinical presentationDue to frequent cortical involvement, they most commonly (two-thirds of patients) present with seizures 9. Otherwise, clinical presentation is non-specific with symptoms related to increased intracranial pressure and focal neurological deficits being common. Pathology LocationThe vast majority of oligodendrogliomas arise in the cerebral hemispheres, with brainstem, cerebellum and spinal cord being distinctly uncommon 9. Gross appearanceHistorically, oligodendrogliomas were considered well-circumscribed, gelatinous, grey masses, and this remains true of histologically defined oligodendrogliomas NOS. IDH-mutant and 1p19q co-deleted oligodendrogliomas, however, appear to be a different group of tumors and recent studies suggest that in fact they have poorly defined borders 10.  Oligodendrogliomas are often calcified (70-90% of histological oligodendrogliomas: one of the most frequently calcifying tumors) and also frequently demonstrate focal hemorrhage 9. Cystic change is also quite common. Slow growing cortical tumors can often expand a gyrus and eventually remodel the skull. Microscopic appearance and classificationIt is essential to appreciate that as of the 2016 update to the WHO classification of CNS tumors, to formally make the diagnosis of oligodendroglioma, a tumor must be shown to have IDH-mutation and 1p19q co-deletion (see Terminology section above). Oligodendroglioma (WHO grade II)Neoplastic oligodendrocytes appear as regular cells with spherical nuclei containing finely granular chromatin surrounded by a halo of cytoplasm "fried egg" appearance under the light microscope. Typically contains a delicate network of anastomosing capillaries giving it a so-called "chicken wire" appearance 6. These tumors are slowly growing.Anaplastic oligodendroglioma (WHO grade III)Anaplastic oligodendrogliomas (discussed separately) demonstrate increased cellular density, increased mitotic activity, microvascular proliferation and necrosis.  Nuclear anaplasia is also common.Importantly, and unlike astrocytomas, oligodendrogliomas with necrosis and microvascular proliferation are considered only WHO grade III anaplastic oligodendrogliomas and not WHO grade IV glioblastomas 9. OligoastrocytomaOligoastrocytomas (discussed separately) are tumors of mixed oligodendroglioma and astrocytoma cell populations, that have historically been variably reported depending on local practice. As of the 2016 update to the WHO classification of CNS tumors, to make the diagnosis genomic evidence of both astrocytic and oligodendroglial components will be required to make the diagnosis, and as such, they are likely to become rare 9. Radiographic featuresCTNon-contrast CTTumors are of mixed density (hypodense to isodense). High-attenuation areas within the tumor are likely from calcification (70-90% of oligodendrogliomas are calcified) or, less commonly, hemorrhage. Calcification can be located centrally, peripherally or can be ribbon-like 4. The overlying skull may show pressure remodelling.Post-contrast CTApproximately 50% of oligodendrogliomas enhance: the degree of enhancement is extremely variable, ranging from no enhancement to strikingly vivid enhancement.MRIThe MRI appearances also vary depending on whether a histological diagnosis or a molecular definition is used.Oligodendrogliomas NOS, or those tumors that histologically show oligodendroglial features but are 1p/19q intact show more homogeneous signal on T1 and T2 images and have sharper borders than 'true' oligodendroglioma, those with 1p/19q co-deletion 10. In fact, a well-circumscribed homogeneously hypoattenuating non-calcified cortical tumor is probably predictive of not having 1p19q codeletion 10. Calcification and hemorrhage are difficult to distinguish on MR, appearing as areas of signal loss on T2* sequences, but phase component of SWI may help. Peritumoral vasogenic edema is minimal.  T1: typically hypointense   T2: typically hyperintense (except calcified areas)  T2*: calcium can be seen as areas of "blooming"  T1 C+ (Gd): contrast enhancement is common but it is not a reliable indicator of tumor grade, with only 50% of oligodendrogliomas enhancing to a variable degree, and usually heterogeneously  DWI typically no diffusion restriction DWI can be used to help differentiate oligodendrogliomas (generally lower grade) from astrocytomas (generally higher grade); astrocytomas have higher ADC values probably because of their lower cellularity and greater hyaluronan proportion 5.    MR perfusion (PWI): increased vascularity "chicken wire" network of vascularity results in elevated relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV) of grade II vs grade III on PWI; PWI has a sensitivity of 95% and PPV or 87% for distinguishing grade II from grade III oligodendrogliomas; a threshold of 1.75, rCBV above this threshold demonstrates more rapid tumor progression 1  PET11C-Methionine studies can be used to differentiate oligodendrogliomas from anaplastic oligodendrogliomas. FDG uptake of oligodendrogliomas is similar to normal white matter. FDG uptake of anaplastic oligodendrogliomas is similar to normal grey matter.Treatment and prognosisAs mentioned earlier response to radiochemotherapy and hence prognosis depends significantly on the presence or absence of 1p19q gene deletion 2,7. Treatment is surgical, with adjuvant radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Although they are macroscopically well delineated, infiltration is present at their margins and local recurrence is common.Survival statistics are primarily available for histologically defined oligodendrogliomas and tend to demonstrate 10 year-survival of approximately 50% 9. Differential diagnosisGeneral imaging differential considerations include: astrocytoma ganglioglioma dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumor (DNET) pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma (PXA)  cerebritis/herpes simplex (HSV) encephalitis  cerebral ischemia/infarction cerebral arteriovenous malformation (AVM) 
__label__Central __label__Nervous __label__System Oligodendroglioma NOS (not-otherwise-specified) is a diagnosis in the current (2016) WHO classification of CNS tumors denoting a diffuse infiltrating glioma that has histological features of oligodendroglioma, but without 1p19q co-deletion status or IDH mutation status being available (either because the test has not been performed, or the markers are equivocal) 1. It is, therefore, equivalent to the diagnosis of oligodendroglioma pre-2016, and it is essential to note that the imaging features of oligodendrogliomas defined on histological grounds versus those defined using 1p19q co-deletion and IDH mutation are not identical. These are discussed further in the article on oligodendroglioma. Importantly, neither ATRX status (usually the opposite of 1p19q co-deletion status) nor additional immunohistochemical markers such as NOGO-A are substitutes for formal 1p19q co-deletion determination, and as such unless both IDH mutation and 1p19q co-deletion are assessed, the formal diagnosis of oligodendroglioma cannot be made.

__label__Oncology Oligometastases, or oligometastatic disease, refers to a distant disease that is limited in number and distribution, Niibe et al. defined this as ≤5 metastatic/recurrent lesions with control of the primary lesion 1,2. Also, there has been established a maximum of 3 different metastatic sites 3. These metastases can be treated with local measures (surgery, radiation therapy, thermal ablation, etc.) with the aim of increasing survival. This is a shift from traditional thinking where the metastatic disease was considered an end-stage disease with limited treatment options. 
__label__Oncology Oligoprogression is an increasingly recognized concept in oncology, denoting a state where after an initially successfully systemic therapy of disseminated metastases, a single or very few lesions display further progression.  On this page:  Article: Terminology Pathology Treatment and prognosis Practical points Related articles References   TerminologyA key difference between the related concepts of oligometastasis and oligoprogression is that a patient with the latter can have generally any number of metastases as long as only a solitary or a select few show progression, with the rest displaying either regression or stability while the patient continues to receive systemic antitumor therapy 1. By definition, the state of oligoprogression occurs after initially successful therapy of polymetastatic disease, where disease progression is encountered only in a minority of the affected sites 2. PathologyOligoprogression is caused by the emergence of tumor cell phenotypes of varying aggressivity and thereby of differing progression potential during the clonal evolution of the disseminated tumor.  Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is one of the best-studied examples of malignant diseases capable of demonstrating an oligoprogression pattern. Existing evidence also shows that clear cell renal cell carcinoma and prostate cancer also commonly show oligoprogression 1. Oligoprogression due to selective sub-clonal drug resistance is increasingly encountered since the advent of targeted, molecular antitumor agents 2. Treatment and prognosisTargeted therapies such as stereotactic radiosurgery, cryotherapy and surgery are the mainstays for the treatment of patients showing tumor oligoprogression 1. Selective, minimally invasive therapy can thereby allow the continuation of the systemic therapy that is otherwise effective against the majority of the tumor cell subclones 2.  Practical pointsKnowledge of oligoprogression as a concept is crucial in radiology practice, especially as these patients with multiple metastases among which only a select few show progression during the systemic (chemo-, or biological therapy) may still benefit from its continuation (as it does affect the majority of the metastatic burden), whilst the single or few metastatic foci showing oligoprogression are excellent candidates for other targeted therapies (e.g. surgical resection, ablation, selective chemoembolisation, focused cryo- or radiotherapy)1. Thus, if only a single, or a small minority of metastatic foci show interval progression, the possibility of an oligoprogressive disease must be considered.  The criteria of oligoprogression have not yet solidified, with some studies describing a precise number e.g. four or fewer sites of progression in NSCLC as the prerequisite for it 3. It is important to bear in mind that current reporting standards (e.g. the RECIST v.1.1 criteria) are not yet adapted to the concept of oligoprogression, furthermore, it is currently uncertain which imaging modalities are the most suitable to distinguish oligoprogression from polyprogression 2.

__label__Hepatobiliary __label__Gastrointestinal An omentum is a double layer of peritoneum that attaches the stomach to another viscus: the greater omentum hangs from the greater curvature of the stomach like an apron the lesser omentum attaches the lesser curvature of the stomach to the liver superiorly Gross anatomyGreater omentumThe greater omentum is the largest peritoneal fold, consisting of a double sheet folded upon itself and thus made up of four layers. The two layers of peritoneum descend from the greater curve of the stomach and proximal duodenum passing inferiorly, anterior to the small bowel for a variable distance, and then turn superiorly again to insert into the anterosuperior aspect of the transverse colon. The left border is continuous with the gastrosplenic ligament; the right extends as far as the origin of the duodenum. It is also known as the 'police of the abdomen' due to its rich vascular supply. During intra-abdominal sepsis/inflammation, it can move to the infected area and delivers lymphocytes to fight the infection.Lesser omentumThe lesser omentum is the fold of peritoneum extending from the lesser curvature of the stomach and proximal 2 cm of the duodenum to the porta hepatis of the liver. It is formed by hepatogastric and hepatoduodenal ligaments. It forms the anterior surface of the lesser sac. At its free edge, which extends to the porta hepatis, it forms the hepatoduodenal ligament. It is attached to its superior extent to the fissures for the porta hepatis and ligamentum venosum.Related pathology omental infarction omental cake

__label__Head __label__& __label__Neck The omohyoid muscle is an infrahyoid muscle of the neck that is innervated by the ansa cervicalis of the cervical plexus receiving fibers from the ventral rami of C1–C3 spinal nerves. The omohyoid is a paired, flat strap of muscle that is made up of superior and inferior bellies joined by an intermediate tendon. The primary function of the omohyoid muscle is to depress and fix the hyoid bone and underlying larynx though it also draws the hyoid bone downwards in phonation and in the terminal phase of swallowing. On this page:  Article: Summary Gross anatomy Arterial supply Innervation Action Variant anatomy Related articles References   Images:Cases and figures  Summary  origin: transverse scapular ligament and superior border of scapula medial to the suprascapular notch   insertion: lateral and inferior border of the hyoid bone  innervation: anterior rami of C1–C3 spinal nerves from the cervical plexus; the superior and inferior bellies are innervated by separate nerves of the ansa cervicalis   action: depresses and fixes the hyoid bone draws the hyoid bone and underlying larynx downwards in phonation and the terminal phase of swallowing intermediate tendon of the muscle tenses overlying cervical fascia and maintains patency of the internal jugular vein    Gross anatomyOriginThe omohyoid muscle originates from the superior border of the scapula medial to the suprascapular notch. The muscle may also derive from the transverse scapular ligament.  InsertionAs the omohyoid muscle courses upwards from an almost horizontal inferior belly and comes to lie over the internal jugular vein it is replaced by a flat (intermediate) tendon (see deep cervical fascia). The muscle continues with the superior belly which courses more vertically upwards and comes to lie on the carotid sheath. The superior belly of omohyoid passes beneath the sternocleidomastoid muscle and finally comes to converge with the sternohyoid muscle. The omohyoid inserts edge to edge with the sternohyoid muscle on the lateral part of the inferior border of the hyoid bone. The omohyoid muscle inserts lateral to the sternohyoid muscle.RelationsThe superior belly of the omohyoid muscle forms the anteroinferior border of the carotid triangle vascular area, which houses the upper part of the common carotid artery, carotid sinus and carotid body. The carotid triangle is formed by the anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle posteriorly, the posterior belly of the digastric muscle anterosuperiorly and the superior belly of the omohyoid anteroinferiorly.The intermediate tendon of the omohyoid muscle lies over the internal jugular vein and is able to slide easily on the underlying vein. The tendon is sometimes used in dissections of the neck to identify the internal jugular vein immediately underneath.Arterial supplyblood supply from branches of the inferior thyroid artery Innervation omohyoid muscle is supplied by the anterior rami of C1–C3 spinal nerves from the cervical plexus  the superior and inferior bellies are innervated by separate nerves of the ansa cervicalis  ActionThe omohyoid muscle primarily depresses and fixes the hyoid bone and underlying larynx. The omohyoid muscle has also been thought to depress the larynx and hyoid bone in phonation and in the terminal phase of swallowing. The intermediate tendon of the omohyoid muscle overlies and tenses the cervical fascia ensuring patency of the internal jugular vein.Variant anatomyA number of anatomical variants have been noted regarding the anatomy of the omohyoid muscle which are often clinically relevant given the proximity of the muscle to significant neurovascular structures. duplicate or double bellies of both the superior and inferior portions of the muscle have been reported in cadaveric case series significant variations in the origin and insertion of the muscle have also been reported in a number of case series likely related to the embryology of the muscle, which is first attached in the fetus to the medial end of the clavicle. The process of migration of the muscle to the superior aspect of the scapula may be arrested at any point.  
__label__Musculoskeletal The omovertebral bone (os omovertebrale) is present in ~35% (range 19-47%) of cases of Sprengel deformity.Gross anatomyIt runs from the superomedial border of the scapula to the spinous processes, transverse processes or laminae of C4 to C7 1,2. Occasionally it can be bilateral 2. The connection from the scapula to the vertebrae may be fibrous or osseous.
__label__Gastrointestinal __label__Paediatrics __label__Obstetrics Omphaloceles, also known as exomphalos (rare plural: exomphali), are congenital midline abdominal wall defects at the base of the umbilical cord insertion, with herniation of gut (or occasionally other structures) out of the fetal abdomen. On this page:  Article: Epidemiology Pathology Radiographic features Treatment and prognosis History and etymology Differential diagnosis See also References   Images:Cases and figures  EpidemiologyThe estimated occurrence can be up to 1:4000 of live births 3.PathologyTypically a large anterior abdominal wall defect will be present, through which liver and/or bowel herniate, covered by a peritoneal membrane as well as amnion. The umbilical cord typically inserts at or near the apex. As the midline herniation is normal in a fetus until around gestational age 11-12 weeks, this abnormality is only identified on the second-trimester scans.EtiologySome suggest that the formation of an omphalocele may be due to the failure of the medial segments of the two lateral embryonic wall folds to fuse at approximately 3-4 weeks post conception. This defect at the umbilical ring allows the abdominal content to herniate into a sac comprised of an outer layer of amnion and an inner layer of peritoneum and often Wharton's jelly.General pathogenesis includes teratogenic effects by early pregnancy use of antithyroid drugs 10.GeneticsIsolated cases are often sporadic.AssociationsAssociated anomalies are high (27-91% 7) and are thought to be more common in smaller omphalocele containing bowel only 4.Such anomalies include:  chromosomal anomalies: can occur in 20-50% of cases; the risk of an associated chromosomal anomaly is higher when the omphalocele is detected earlier in gestation  trisomy 18: considered the most common associated chromosomal anomaly trisomy 13 trisomy 21 Turner syndrome Klinefelter syndrome Pallister-Killian syndrome   other syndromic associations Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome pentalogy of Cantrell  OEIS complex: omphalocele, bladder/cloacal exstrophy, imperforate anus, spinal anomalies lethal omphalocele-cleft palate syndrome    other fetal gastrointestinal anomalies: which confer a poor prognosis fetal CNS anomalies fetal cardiac anomalies: can occur in 50% of cases fetal genitourinary anomalies bladder exstrophy cloacal exstrophy   fetal skeletal anomaliesomphalocele-radial ray (ORR) complex  Serological markersraised maternal alpha-fetoprotein (MSAFP)Radiographic featuresAntenatal ultrasound multiple bowel loops (and on occasion liver) herniate into a membrane-covered defect (i.e. not free-flowing) and are usually seen as hyperechogenic content (non-fluid filled bowel) the umbilical cord insertion is directly into the omphalocele may also show evidence of polyhydramnios  the abdominal circumference may be smaller as a result an allantoic cyst is often present Plain radiographIn neonates, radiographs show herniated bowel loops covered by a membrane.CTCT, although not routinely used in neonates, permits direct visualization of herniation content +/- evidence of any malrotation.MRI as with CT, allows better direct visualization of the herniation through the abdominal wall the herniated liver is often of low T2 signal and the bowel of high T2 signal Treatment and prognosisAn omphalocele is associated with higher morbidity and mortality than gastroschisis, primarily due to a higher incidence of associated congenital anomalies. Smaller omphaloceles are thought to carry a worse prognosis due to increased risk of associated abnormalities.Mortality rates can approach 80% when associated anomalies are present and increase to ~100% when chromosomal or cardiovascular anomalies exist. However, if found in isolation, then the associated mortality rate decreases to ~10% 3.Complicationsruptured omphaloceleHistory and etymologyThe word omphalocele is derived from the Greek words "omphalos" (Ομφαλός) meaning naval, and "cele", meaning pouch 6.Differential diagnosisFor imaging appearances consider: pseudo-omphalocele  gastroschisis: smaller paraumbilical defect usually to the right of midline, usually containing only bowel loops and not covered by a membrane  physiological gut herniation: this diagnosis should only be entertained in early pregnancy prior to 11.4 weeks or in gestation with crown-rump length less than 55 mm. The physiologic midgut herniation should not exceed 7 mm in diameter  limb-body wall complex: large defect usually to the left of midline  umbilical hernia: abdominal wall hernia See alsoruptured omphalocele
__label__Obstetrics __label__Gynaecology An omphalomesenteric duct cyst is a type of true umbilical cord cyst. On this page:  Article: Pathology Radiographic features Differential diagnosis References   PathologyThe omphalomesenteric duct serves as a communication between the midgut and yolk sac In early embryonic life and usually obliterates between the 9-18th week of gestation. The omphalomesenteric duct cyst is an embryologic remnant of the yolk stalk. If the yolk stalk does not obliterate completely, various portions may persist giving rise to many entities including an omphalomesenteric duct cyst. The cysts are lined by a columnar mucin-secreting epithelium. Eventually, these cysts may contain gastric, colonic, pancreatic and/or small intestinal epithelium.Radiographic featuresAntenatal ultrasoundThey may be seen as a cystic mass towards the fetal end of the umbilical cord aswell as being located close to the periphery of the cord (c.f. allantoic cysts which are central). Color Doppler interrogation show no vascularity (c.f. umbilical arterial aneurysm).Differential diagnosis  allantoic cyst: located centrally in the cord  umbilical arterial aneurysm: show Doppler signal

__label__Obstetrics Omphalopagus twins are joined at the front and at the level of the umbilicus.Commonly involved structures are lower thorax fusion and liver fusion. Pericardium may be common, but the heart is never shared. Stomach and the proximal small intestines are usually separate but the small intestines may join at the level of the Meckel diverticulum. The colon separates distally, and each twin has a rectum. There are four arms and four legs with no pelvic or urinary tract union.Omphalopagus is difficult to differentiate from thoracopagus on the gross survey, the main difference being the absence of cardiac sharing. Omphalopagus twins are the ones with the best chance of survival post-separation.Diagnosis can be established as early as the 8th week of gestation by transvaginal ultrasound. The ideal time for evaluation is between 11th and 12th weeks.See alsoconjoined twins

__label__Musculoskeletal Bipolar shoulder lesions of anterior glenohumeral dislocations (i.e. combined bony Bankart and Hill-Sachs lesions) put patients at increased risk of Hill-Sachs engagement or recurrent instability. Determining if the Hill-Sachs lesions are on-track or off-track can help guide management, although arthroscopy remains gold-standard for diagnosis.  On this page:  Article: Pathology Radiographic features Treatment and prognosis References   PathologyThe glenoid track refers to the area of contact between the humeral head and glenoid and is defined as approximately 83% of glenoid width 2. A Hill-Sachs lesion that is smaller than the track ("on-track") will maintain contact and is at lower risk of engagement and instability. Conversely, a Hill-Sachs lesion that is larger than the glenoid track ("off-track") will be at increased risk of engagement and instability (i.e. is an "engaging Hill-Sachs lesion"). Thus there are two factors that contribute to determining if a bipolar bone lesion is on-track or off-track: anteroinferior glenoid bone loss  Hill-Sachs interval size Off-track lesions can result from either a large bony Bankart lesion or Hill-Sachs lesion or from both Hill-Sachs and bony Bankart lesions being moderate-sized. Radiographic featuresDetermining on-track or off-track lesions was initially described on CT but can also be calculated on MRI 2. Two measurements are required 2:  glenoid track: calculated on a coronal oblique plane of the glenoid using the best-fit circle method a best-fit circle is placed on the glenoid, matching the posterior and inferior borders a horizontal line is drawn through the center of the best-fit circle reaching both anterior and posterior aspects (D) a second horizontal line is drawn along the same plane from the anterior aspect of the circle to the anterior glenoid (d), i.e. measuring the width of anterior glenoid bone loss glenoid track = (0.83 x D) - d    Hill-Sachs interval = Hill-Sachs lesion + bone bridge between the rotator cuff attachment and lateral aspect of the Hill-Sachs lesionmeasured in the axial plane  A bipolar lesion is said to be engaging if the Hill-Sachs interval is larger than the glenoid track. Treatment and prognosisOff-track bipolar lesions may be treated surgically with reconstitution of the anteroinferior glenoid bone stock (commonly via a Latarjet procedure) +/- remplissage depending on the size of the Hill-Sachs lesion 3.

__label__Central __label__Nervous __label__System The open ring sign is a relatively specific sign for demyelination, most commonly multiple sclerosis (MS), and is helpful in distinguishing between the causes of ring-enhancing lesions. Radiographic featuresThe enhancing component is thought to represent advancing front of demyelination and thus favors the white matter side of the lesion. The open part of the ring will therefore usually point towards the grey matter 3.Treatment and prognosisOften patients with such lesions undergo biopsy, where the histology can be difficult to interpret. Abundant bizarre astrocytes with frequent mitoses can suggest the diagnosis of glioblastoma. Toxoplasmosis may also be suggested by the presence of giant cells (Creutzfeldt cells).As such, careful assessment of imaging is essential to avoid unnecessary and misleading intervention.

More specifically it consists of the cortical areas adjacent to the insular lobe and its surrounding circular sulcus. On this page:  Article: Gross anatomy Function History and etymology Related articles References   Images:Cases and figures  Gross anatomyThe operculum can be divided into three portions: the frontal operculum begins at the anterior ramus of the lateral fissure and extends to the inferior portions of the precentral gyrus, encompassing the pars triangularis and opercularis of the inferior frontal gyrus  the parietal operculum lies between the inferior portion of the postcentral gyrus and posterior rami of the lateral fissure. The frontal and parietal regions are often grouped together as the frontoparietal operculum the temporal operculum is inferior to the lateral fissure itself and is formed by the superior temporal and transverse temporal (Heschl's) gyri FunctionThe function of the operculum depends primarily on the location of each of its segments. The frontal operculum rostral to the ascending ramus of the lateral fissure is associated with the prefrontal association cortex and plays a role in thought, cognition, and planning behavior. The frontoparietal operculum caudal to the ascending ramus is thought to contain the gustatory cortex and govern discrimination of various taste qualities. As the parietal operculum contains inferior portions of the precentral and postcentral gyri, it also has a role in primary somatosensory and motor function.The temporal operculum contains Heschl's gyrus which serves as the primary auditory complex. This is the termination of the afferent auditory pathway after having received fibers from the medial geniculate nucleus.History and etymologyOperculum is the Latin word for lid or cover.After the dissection of Albert Einstein's brain, there were claims that it was missing the parietal opercula bilaterally allowing his inferior parietal lobe to grow 15% wider than normal. It was thought that this could explain his great mathematical and scientific prowess. However, the debate regarding the legitimacy of these variations still continues.

Among paraneoplastic etiologies in adults with OMS, small cell lung cancer is the most common.PathologyWhile the pathophysiology is unknown, OMS is felt to be related to autoimmunity. As a result of cerebellar Purkinje cell dysfunction, oculomotor neurons of the caudal fastigial nucleus of the cerebellum become progressively disinhibited. Anti-neuronal and anti-Purkinje cell antibodies have been implicated in OMS, however, they are not universally isolated in patients with OMD presentations 5.Diagnostic criteriaA 2004 working group proposed the following clinical diagnostic criteria comprising three of the following four features 6: opsoclonus ataxia and/or myoclonus behavioral changes or sleep disturbances diagnosis of neuroblastoma Treatment and prognosisIf neuroblastoma is found in a patient with opsomyoclonus, it is generally small with relatively favourable histology and the prognosis, in terms of survival, is very good. The neurologic symptoms may be treated with corticosteroids and/or ACTH, but often persist despite the medical treatment and surgical resection 2.

__label__Head __label__& __label__Neck Optic disc drusen (ODD), or hyaline bodies, are a relatively common entity usually found incidentally on CT or on follow-up of abnormal fundoscopy. On this page:  Article: Epidemiology Clinical presentation Pathology Radiographic features Treatment and prognosis Differential diagnosis References   Images:Cases and figures  EpidemiologyOptic disc drusen are identified radiographically in up to 0.3-3.7% of the population and are frequently bilateral 1,4,5. They are typically seen in patients with age-related macular degeneration 7. They can also be familial and inherited as a dominant trait 1,4. In general, they are more common in Caucasians than African-Americans 4.AssociationsA large number of entities have been described associated with optic disc drusen 3-5,10 acquired myelinated nerve fibers Adams-Oliver syndrome aneurysm of the ophthalmic artery astrocytic hamartoma Best’s vitelliform macular dystrophy β-thalassemia  Birdshot chorioretinopathy and Cacchi-Ricci syndrome  combined hamartoma of the retina and retinal pigment epithelium congenital night blindness familial macular dystrophy glaucoma gyrate atrophy idiopathic intracranial hypertension idiopathic parafoveal telangiectasia Joubert syndrome morning glory disc anomaly ocular tumoral calcinosis optic nerve tumors peripapillary central serous retinopathy  pigmented paravenous retinochoroidal atrophy (PPRCA)  pseudoxanthoma elasticum and angioid streaks  retinitis pigmentosa Severe Early Childhood Onset Retinal Dystrophy (SECORD) tilted optic disc  tubulointerstitial nephritis and uveitis (TINU) syndrome VACTERL association Clinical presentationMost cases of drusen are asymptomatic, although patients may report an episodic visual loss. The blind spot may also be enlarged, but this is subtle and is only usually found following formal visual field mapping 4.Fundoscopic findings depend on how deeply the drusen is located in the optic disc. Superficial deposits exhibit characteristic autofluorescence making the diagnosis in such cases obvious. Deeper deposits have less-specific appearances with swelling of the optic disc that mimics papilledema (pseudopapilloedema) 1,4,9.PathologyOptic disc drusen are small collections of hyaline material located within the head of the optic nerve (CN II) at variable depths 1-3. The earliest signs of drusen formation histologically are small globular or plaque-like deposits in Bruch membrane of hyaline material, present in the majority of individuals, and perhaps congenital in nature 3. Small hard drusen (<63 micrometers), visible on graded fundus photography are seen in a high proportion of individuals.  They are not thought to be a risk factor for the development of age-related maculopathy, and their prevalence is not age-dependent 2. They are not visible on imaging.Over time in some individuals, multiple micro-drusen (<25 micrometers) coalesce 2,3. These larger deposits increase in prevalence with age and are associated with age-related maculopathy 2. As they mineralize, it is these drusen that are visible radiographically.Radiographic featuresOptic disc drusen vary in size from less than 1 mm to up to 4 mm in diameter and 3 mm in thickness 1.UltrasoundOcular ultrasound demonstrates an echogenic focus within or on the surface of the optic nerve head. Posterior acoustic shadowing may be present with larger lesions 1.CTAlthough drusen can be identified in childhood, they are small and non-mineralized. As such, drusen are rarely identified in the pediatric patient, although a region of slightly increased density and swelling may be evident on thin-section scans 3.Treatment and prognosisIn the vast majority of cases, no therapy is required 5. Occasionally, especially when drusen are large, vascular complications may occur, e.g. non-anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION), central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO), central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO) 5. Optic pressure-lowering agents may be of benefit if pressures are elevated, although whether elevated pressures represent glaucoma superimposed on drusen, or a direct complication of drusen cannot be distinguished 5.Differential diagnosisWhen there are typical appearances, the differential is small. In general, the differential includes other causes of calcification of the globe including:  retinoblastoma usually a mass with calcification protruding into the vitreous body usually not located at the optic disc    astrocytic hamartomas  seen in patients with tuberous sclerosis or neurofibromatosis  usually unilateral usually larger associated with retinal detachment 1    chorioretinitis choroidal osteoma 
__label__Central __label__Nervous __label__System __label__Head __label__& __label__Neck The optic nerve is the second cranial nerve which, along with the olfactory nerve (CN I), is really an extension of the central nervous system. It is not surrounded by Schwann cells with the first sensory bipolar cell body located peripherally in the retina. Their central processes synapse on ganglion cells on the vitreous surface of the retina and their central processes pass via the optic disc out of the globe and form the optic nerve proper.The optic nerve is divided into four segments:  intraocular segment: lies within the retina and emerges through a scleral opening (lamina cribrosa)  intraorbital segment: passes posteriorly and centrally within the orbit and is surrounded by dural lining and CSF; hence it directly communicates with the subarachnoid space and therefore allows transmission of increased pressure from hydrocephalus to manifest as papilledema; additionally, the dural covering can develop a meningioma   intracanalicular segment: where the optic nerve exits through the tendinous ring and optic canal superior to the ophthalmic artery   intracranial or cisternal segment: enters the middle cranial fossa and passes within the suprasellar cistern with the anterior cerebral artery at its superolateral aspect joining the contralateral optic nerve at the optic chiasm  At the optic chiasm, the nasal fibers of each optic nerve (fibers carrying light impulses from the nasal side of the retina) decussate while the temporal fibers do not (partial decussation). From the optic chiasm arise two optic tracts, each one containing nasal fibers of the contralateral optic nerve and temporal fibers from the ipsilateral optic nerve. The optic tract courses around the cerebral peduncle to relay in the lateral geniculate body of the thalamus.Arising from the lateral geniculate body of the thalamus, the optic radiations are divided into superior and inferior bundles. The superior bundle carries information from the superior retinal quadrant that represents the inferior visual field and ends at the superior aspect of calcarine sulcus (cuneus). The inferior bundle (including Meyer loop) carries information from the inferior retinal quadrant which represents the superior visual field. It passes anteriorly in the temporal lobe and forms the lateral wall of the inferior horn of lateral ventricle before passing posteriorly to end inferior to the calcarine sulcus (lingual gyrus).

__label__Central __label__Nervous __label__System Optic nerve sheath diameter has significance in the assessment of papilledema in cases of elevated intracranial pressure.PathologyThe optic nerve sheath demonstrates changes in diameter with CSF pressure changes as there is a layer of subarachnoid space between the nerve and its sheath, which expands due to raised intracranial pressure. These changes are appreciated more along the anterior aspect of the nerve.Radiographic featuresMeasurements of the optic nerve sheath diameter (ONSD) are most often taken at a distance of 3 mm from the posterior globe margin as this is believed to be the site of maximum pressure changes along the long axis of the optic nerve 1,2,4. It should be noted, however, that measuring at this location is not universally accepted, and other authors suggest measuring 8 mm from the globe 3. These measurements can be performed on ultrasound using a linear array probe, on a T2 weighted sequence on MRI or on CT 1-4. The intermodality difference in measurements is minimal and correlate well with CSF pressure changes ref. UltrasoundIntensive care and emergency point of care ultrasonography literature typically uses the following cutoffs, as measured inner-edge to inner-edge, for the upper limit of normal of the ONSD 6: up to 4 mm in infants up to 4.5 mm in children up to 5 mm in adultsmeasurements above 5 mm (bilaterally) correspond with elevations in intracranial pressure above 20 mmHg   Further degrees of ICP elevation result in a linear increase in ONSD up to 7.5 mm, at which the diameter appears to plateau. Confirmation that the measured diameter represent a fluid shift due to elevated ICP can be confirmed with a "30 degree test;" measurements are taken in primary gaze and 30 degrees from primary gaze.A decrease in ONSD by >15% width on 30 degree eccentric gaze is moderately specific for an increased intracranial pressure as the etiology of the elevated ONSD, while a negative test (no change in nerve sheath diameter on eccentric gaze) would suggest alternative etiologies e.g. infiltrative disease.Differentiation between acute and chronic elevations in ICP may be aided by the crescent sign (the sonographic correlate of papilledema 5), the presence of which infers chronicity.ValuesNormal maximal diameter values vary somewhat from publication to publication and similarly, the threshold above which raised ICP should be considered also varies depending on definitions and study technique. When measuring 3 mm from the globe, the upper-limit maximum optic nerve sheath diameter threshold has ranged between 4.8 to 6.2 mm 4When measuring 8 mm from the globe on CT normal maximum optic nerve sheath diameter is 5.8 m 3.It should be also noted that there is probably a relationship between globe diameter and normal optic nerve diameter and some have advocated that a ratio of the two may be more appropriate 4. Irrespective of technique or value is chosen it is important to recognize that this measurement is at best imperfect and does not replace the need for pressure monitoring via other means if clinically indicated. 
__label__Central __label__Nervous __label__System __label__Head __label__& __label__Neck __label__Oncology Optic nerve meningiomas are benign tumors arising from the arachnoid cap cells of the optic nerve sheath and represent ~20% of all orbital meningiomas, the majority of which are direct extensions from intracranial meningiomas. These tumors typically appear as masses within the optic nerve, isointense to grey matter on both T1 and T2 weighted imaging, demonstrating vivid enhancement which clashes with the non-enhancing optic nerve ("tram-track sign" on axials or "non-enhancing dot sign" on coronals).  On this page:  Article: Epidemiology Clinical presentation Pathology Radiographic features Treatment and prognosis Differential diagnosis Related articles References   Images: Cases and figures Imaging differential diagnosis   EpidemiologyOptic nerve meningiomas account for approximately a third of all optic nerve neoplasms; optic nerve gliomas are the most common entity. Unlike optic nerve gliomas which occur primarily in children, optic nerve meningiomas are usually seen in adults (mean age at presentation 40 years) 1,5, however up to 25% present in children, in which case they tend to be more aggressive 5.Similar to meningiomas elsewhere there is a female predilection 1. The vast majority of cases are sporadic, although patients with neurofibromatosis type II (NF2) are at increased risk.Clinical presentationClinical presentation is with a combination of: visual loss present to a greater or lesser degree in 95% of cases 1  initially, visual obscurations may be transient 4  painless and progressive more pronounced with lesions that affect the orbital apex  exacerbated during pregnancy    proptosis present to a greater or lesser degree in 60-90% of cases 1  more pronounced with anterior lesions near the globe occurs later, as a tumor enlarges may be exacerbated by associated hyperostosis   These lesions are almost always unilateral, with the exception of NF2 patients who may develop bilateral tumors. Occasionally a unilateral tumor will grow posteriorly, across the chiasm and along the contralateral nerve.A particular clinical presentation is worth mentioning due to the potential pitfall. An intracanalicular lesion may cause marked visual loss with a very small tumor and clinical presentation may be similar to optic neuritis. As these patients are often middle-aged women, the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis may be suspected. Thus in patients being imaged for 'optic neuritis' careful inspection of the optic canals is important 2.PathologyOptic nerve meningiomas arise from the arachnoid cap cells of the optic nerve sheath, and as such are on the inside of the dura (remember that the arachnoid layer is immediately deep to the inner layer of the dura mater). The tumor extends through the overlying dura and typically has a smooth or somewhat lobulated contour. The optic nerve, which is usually circumferentially encased, gradually atrophies due to compression 1,4.The most common type of meningioma histologically is the meningothelial variety 5.Radiographic featuresMeningiomas of the optic nerve sheath have the same imaging characteristics as meningiomas elsewhere. The morphology of the tumor is variable: tubular: 65% 1,5  exophytic: 25% fusiform: 10% Occasionally cysts filled with arachnoid fluid develop between the globe and the anterior margin of the tumor as a result of impaired CSF flow backwards. These are known as perioptic cysts 1,3.CTThe tumor is usually isoattenuating to the optic nerve on non-contrast studies, although calcification is sometimes seen. Following administration of contrast, the tumor enhances 1,4.On axial or oblique sagittal imaging the enhancing tumor surrounding the non-enhancing optic nerve results in the so-called tram-track sign. This is most evident in tumors with tubular growth pattern. On coronal imaging, the tumor appears as a cuff of enhancing tumor around a central non-enhancing dot (optic nerve) giving a doughnut appearance (doughnut sign).Tumor extending into the optic canal may lead to canal widening, or alternatively hyperostosis 1.MRIAppearances on MRI are similar to those on CT with a greater ability to delineate posterior extension. Imaging should include thin axial and coronal (+/- sagittal) T1, fat-suppressed T2 and fat-suppressed postcontrast T1 sequences.  T1: isointense to somewhat hypointense compared to the optic nerve  T1 C+ (Gd): homogeneous enhancement  T2: isointense to somewhat hyperintense compared to the optic nerve Careful examination of the orbital apex and optic nerve canals is essential if small intracanalicular tumors are to be identified 2.Treatment and prognosisTreatment of these lesions is problematic and depends on the degree of visual impairment and proptosis. In patients with preserved vision and no proptosis, conservative management with frequent ophthalmologic and radiological follow-up is usually preferred. When vision begins to fail surgical intervention is tempting but often of limited success as far as preserving vision is concerned. Fenestration of the dural sheath has been tried but is of no benefit 1.Severe proptosis requires surgery but almost invariably results in loss of vision. Another indication for surgery is imaging evidence of posterior growth, as this not only makes future attempts at surgical excision much harder, but the mass also threatens the contralateral eye.Radiotherapy has an increasing role in the management of these lesions. Conventional radiotherapy has been used both pre-operatively and postoperatively for many years. More recently stereotactic radiotherapy has been employed as an alternative to surgery, and may well be superior. Care must be exercised however due to the proximity of other important radiosensitive structures 6.Differential diagnosisA number of entities can mimic an optic nerve meningioma and result in enlargement of the optic nerve. More common entities to be considered in the differential include: optic nerve glioma orbital pseudotumor  orbital lymphoma/leukemia  orbital metastases sarcoidosis 
__label__Central __label__Nervous __label__System __label__Head __label__& __label__Neck Optic neuritis denotes inflammation of the optic nerve and is one of the more common causes of optic neuropathy. It can be thought of as broadly divided into infectious and non-infectious causes, although the latter is far more frequent. On imaging, optic neuritis is most easily identified as a unilateral optic nerve swelling, with high T2 signal and contrast enhancement. On this page:  Article: Epidemiology Clinical presentation Pathology Radiographic features Treatment and prognosis References   Images:Cases and figures  EpidemiologyThe demographics of people affected will conform to those of the underlying conditions (see Pathology). As typical optic neuritis is seen in the setting of multiple sclerosis (MS), most patients tend to be young adults, with a predominance of women of 3:1. The incidence is highest in populations living at higher northern latitudes (e.g. Scandinavia, United Kingdom, Canada), again, following the epidemiology of MS 3. Clinical presentationTypical optic neuritis (that seen in the setting of demyelination) causes pain in the orbit (90%), often worse with eye movement, and is associated with visual loss, which reaches a nadir within a few days of symptom onset 1,4. The degree of visual loss is variable, ranging from minimal if any visual loss to complete absence of light perception. Additionally, dyschromatopsia, photopsia and visual field defects may also occur 1. The swinging light test (or Marcus Gunn test) classically reveals a Marcus Gunn pupil, and fundoscopy may demonstrate diffuse optic disc swelling indicative of papillitis (will not be present if inflammation is solely retrobulbar) 1. PathologyIn the majority of cases, typical optic neuritis (as is encountered in multiple sclerosis) is unilateral 1. In contrast, in the setting of neuromyelitis optica (NMO), involvement is usually bilateral. EtiologyOptic neuritis can arise in the setting of many infective and non-infective conditions: non-infective  multiple sclerosis (most common) neuromyelitis optica (NMO) anti-MOG associated encephalomyelitis sarcoidosis acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) toxins radiation-induced chronic relapsing inflammatory optic neuropathy (CRION)   infective Lyme disease toxoplasmosis human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) systemic viral diseases as varicella or herpes    Radiographic featuresMRI is the modality of choice for visualizing the optic nerve. Functional MRI or multifocal visual evoked potentials have also been shown to allow early diagnosis 1. MRITypically findings are most easily identified in the retrobulbar intra-orbital segment of the optic nerve, which appears swollen, with a high T2 signal. High T2 signal persists and may be permanent; chronically the nerve will appear atrophied rather than swollen. Contrast enhancement of the nerve, best seen with fat-suppressed T1 coronal images, is seen in >90% of patients if scanned within 20 days of visual loss 2. Treatment and prognosisTypical optic neuritis is self-limiting, and recovery of vision usually begins within a few weeks of symptom onset 1. Although there is considerable evidence that corticosteroid therapy does not alter visual outcome at six months, it does appear to hasten recovery and some trials have shown persistent improvement of contrast sensitivity, visual fields, and color vision 1. As such, if therapy is prescribed, it is usually 3 or more days of high dose steroids, started as early after symptom onset as possible 1.

It has similar clinical and imaging features to neuromyelitis optica (NMO) and may in fact represent the same disease, in a different population 1,2.The identification of anti-aquaporin 4 IgG antibodies in NMO has naturally lead to them being sought in patients with OSMS, with varying results, ranging form 35-90% 1. Although this higher than positive rates in patients with conventional MS, whether or not NMO and OSMS are the same disease remains to be fully elucidated.As the imaging appearances are similar/identical, please refer to the article on neuromyelitis optica (NMO) for further details.
__label__Central __label__Nervous __label__System __label__Paediatrics Optic pathway gliomas are relatively uncommon tumors, with a variable clinical course and usually seen in the setting of neurofibromatosis type I (NF1). Histologically the majority are pilocytic astrocytomas.They are characterized by imaging by an enlarged optic nerve seen either on CT or MRI. Usually showing low T1 and a high central T2 signal on MRI images, enhancement is variable. On this page:  Article: Terminology Epidemiology Clinical presentation Pathology Radiographic features Treatment and prognosis Differential diagnosis Related articles References   Images: Cases and figures Imaging differential diagnosis   TerminologyThese tumors have sometimes been divided into optic pathway gliomas and hypothalamic gliomas (not to be confused with hypothalamic hamartomas). In cases where a tumor is confined to the optic nerves (Dodge stage 1 – see below), they can safely be referred to as optic nerve gliomas. Often, however, they are either centered on or extend to involve the chiasm and optic radiations. In such cases, they are difficult to distinguish from hypothalamic gliomas and such a distinction is in most instances artificial. In such more posterior cases, the term hypothalamic-optochiasmatic glioma is perhaps more accurate although it certainly does not roll off the tongue.As such, generally, the term optic pathway glioma is favored, recognizing that there may be involvement of the hypothalamus.EpidemiologyOptic pathway gliomas typically present in children, accounting for 10-15% of supratentorial tumors in this age group, and are often in the setting of neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) (10-63%) 3. In this setting, the tumors are often low-grade and indolent.Males and females are approximately equally affected.In adults, optic nerve gliomas do occur but are very rare and usually aggressive tumors 4. In such cases, no association with NF1 has been found 4.Clinical presentationClinical presentation varies depending on the extent and location of the tumor.Decreased vision (63%) 5 is usually evident and can be documented with visual field examination if the child is old enough. In orbital optic nerve gliomas, eventually, mass effects will also occur with proptosis.Involvement of the hypothalamus may result in polyuria/polydipsia 4, as well as obesity, sexual precocity and endocrine dysfunction (e.g. short stature). Diencephalic symptoms include a change in alertness and hyperactivity.In large intracranial tumors, symptoms of raised intracranial pressure, focal neurological deficits and hydrocephalus from distortion of the midbrain may also be encountered.PathologyMost optic pathway gliomas are pilocytic astrocytomas (WHO grade I), although their imaging characteristics are not specific with regard to their histologic features. Varying degrees of cystic change and enhancement are demonstrated. The tumors may appear smooth, fusiform, eccentric, or lobulated.ClassificationThe most widely accepted classification of optic pathway gliomas is the Dodge classification that was first proposed by Dodge et al. in 1958 8. The Dodge classification divides these tumors into just three groups based on anatomical localization: stage 1: optic nerves only stage 2: chiasm involved (with or without optic nerve involvement) stage 3: hypothalamic involvement and/or other adjacent structures A more recent modification of the Dodge classification has been proposed which further subdivides each stage 9.Radiographic featuresPlain radiographRadiographs no longer have any real role to play in the diagnosis of orbital masses, however, if performed enlargement of the optic canal may be demonstrated if a tumor is not confined to the orbit. Additional findings of neurofibromatosis type 1 may also be visible.CTCT is often the first investigation performed and although not as sensitive as MRI, the diagnosis can often be made, especially if thin slice imaging through the orbits is performed, or coronal and sagittal reconstructions obtained from volumetric data.The optic nerve is variably enlarged, and the mass may either be fusiform or exophytic in appearance. Additionally, the nerve may be elongated with kinking or buckling 5.MRIMR imaging is optimal for showing the relationship of the mass to the hypothalamus, optic chiasm, and infundibulum as well as the intraorbital and intercanalicular components of the mass. Large tumors are typically heterogeneous with cystic and solid components.  T1: enlargement, often iso to hypointense compared to the contralateral side  T2 hyperintense centrally thin low-signal at the periphery representing the dura 5     T1 C+ (Gd): enhancement is variable Treatment and prognosisThese tumors demonstrate variable clinical and radiological progression. In patients with NF1, it is not unusual for these tumors to be quiescent, with little progression demonstrated over some years. In others, the tumors are more aggressive with extension along the optic pathways 3.Treatment options, therefore, depend on the clinical context, as well as the location of the tumor at presentation. If it is isolated to one optic nerve and does not extend to the chiasm, then resection is curative (albeit with the loss of vision in that eye). If a tumor extends to the chiasm or more posteriorly, then curative resection is not possible, with resection reserved for treatment of mass effects (proptosis, intracranial mass effect) 3.Differential diagnosisThe main differential is that of optic nerve meningioma, however, the potential list is much longer including most causes of optic nerve enlargement.The absence of calcification can be used to differentiate optic nerve glioma from optic nerve sheath meningioma 6.Additionally, when the bulk of a tumor is located at the chiasm, the differential should include pituitary region masses.
__label__Head __label__& __label__Neck The optic radiation (or geniculocalcarine tract) is part of the visual pathway, forming the connection between the lateral geniculate nucleus of the pulvinar of the thalamus with the primary visual cortex of the occipital lobe. This pathway carries third order neurons correlating to the contralateral visual field. For example, the left sided radiations contain information from the left temporal and right nasal retina. Temporal fibers synapse at layers 2, 3 and 5 of the lateral geniculate nucleus, while nasal fibers at layers 1, 4, and 6. The inferior fibers of the optic radiation correlate with the superior visual field. M-type retinal ganglion cells synapse in layers 1 & 2, while P-type in 3-6. On this page:  Article: Gross anatomy Relations Related pathology Related articles References   Gross anatomyAnatomically, the optic radiations resemble a flattened sheet of white matter. From their origin at the lateral geniculate nucleus, the optic radiations pass through the retrolentiform part of the internal capsule and spread out into three main bundles:  anterior bundle (Meyer loop) central bundle posterior bundle Anterior bundle (Meyer loop)The anterior bundle (Meyer loop) travels anterolaterally along the roof of the temporal horn of the lateral ventricle prior to taking a sharp turn anteroinferiorly around the temporal horn of the lateral ventricle. At this point, its anterior border is ~4.5mm anterior to the temporal horn and is intermingled with anterior commissure fibers. The anterior bundle then tracks backwards, deep to the superior and middle gyri of the temporal lobe, remaining lateral to the temporal horn of the lateral ventricle. The anterior bundle synapses in the anteroinferior border of the calcarine sulcus. Central bundleA central bundle of fibers initially traverses laterally over the roof of the temporal horn of the lateral ventricle, prior to sharply turning posteriorly and continuing laterally along with the occipital horn of the lateral ventricle. The tapetum separates it from the wall of the posterior horn. This bundle travels superiorly to the anterior bundle until synapsing in the posterior calcarine sulcus. The central bundle travels deep to the superior gyrus of the temporal lobe and is related to the auditory radiation (sublentiform internal capsule) and inferior longitudinal fasciculus. Posterior bundleThe posterior bundle tracks dorsally and posteriorly, separated from the lateral wall and roof of the occipital horn of the lateral ventricle only by the tapetum. This posterior bundle is relatively superior to both anterior and central bundles and terminates in the superior lip of the calcarine sulcus. In their relation to the posterior horn of the lateral ventricle, the tapetum and optic radiation together make up the sagittal striatum, which runs in a craniocaudal direction. RelationsKey relations of the optic radiations include; retrolentiform internal capsule (all bundles) anterior temporal horn of lateral ventricle (Meyer’s loop) proximate to the roof and lateral wall of the lateral ventricle (Meyer’s loop and central bundle) lateral wall and roof of the posterior horn of lateral ventricle; separated by the tapetum (Meyer’s Loop – inferior, central bundle – middle, posterior bundle – superior including roof) Related pathologyOptic radiation damage anterior +/- central bundle; homonymous superior quadrantanopia ("pie-in-the-sky" deficit) posterior +/- central bundle; inferior or "pie-in-the-floor" deficit macular vision may be spared in these lesions, particularly if the lesion is in the occipital lobe Vascular lesions lesions affecting the anterior or lateral choroidal arteries may affect the lateral geniculate nucleus the lateral aspect corresponds to the superior visual field the medial aspect corresponds to the inferior visual field    anterior choroidal artery supplies both medial and lateral parts of the lateral geniculate nucleus; an occlusion lesion results in a (usually incomplete) peripheral wedge-shaped homonymous hemianopia  lateral choroidal artery supplies the hilum of the lateral geniculate nucleus; an occlusion here may cause a homonymous horizontal quadrantanopia (i.e. lateral “pie defect”)  middle cerebral artery and posterior cerebral artery infarcts may affect the radiations distal to the lateral geniculate nucleus, and can cause a range of clinical presentations from small homonymous quadrantanopias to dense homonymous hemianopias; these changes are often part of a larger stroke syndrome ischemic and hemorrhagic changes in perforating arteries branching from the MCA and PCA (lateral lenticulostriate, thalamogeniculate), as well as anterior choroidal artery territories, may cause field defects occipital cortex lesions tend to cause homonymous hemianopias of variable size – with or without macular involvement; the MCA may supply the distal tip of the occipital lobe, corresponding to the macula Neoplastic lesions temporal and parietal lobe invasive tumors (i.e. glioma, metastasis) can cause visual field losses relative to their location and may be discovered during investigation for visual field defects lesions in the parietal lobe are associated with paraesthesia, inattention, neglect, apraxia, agnosia, and speech difficulties temporal lobe lesions are associated with memory, auditory, speech and vestibular disturbances, as well as seizures.  it is rare for mass effect lesions to present with isolated optic radiation type field deficit Inflammatory/degenerative conditionsMultiple sclerosis, periventricular leukomalacia, adrenoleukodystrophy (children) may produce mixed, or non-specific field defects.IatrogenicGiven the course of the optic radiation through the anterior temporal lobe, and relation to the inferior basal nuclei, Meyer’s loop may be damaged in anterior temporal lobectomies (50-90%) and amygdalohippocampectomies (50%).

Pathologically, the depth of invasion is defined relative to the horizon of the nearest normal mucosal surface 6. Thus, depth of invasion is greater than tumor thickness when the tumor is ulcerative, and depth of invasion is less than tumor thickness when the tumor is exophytic.The emphasis on depth of invasion supersedes and replaces the prior criterion of extrinsic tongue muscle infiltration for T4 disease, which was difficult to assess clinically and pathologically.The dry vermilion lip has been removed from the definition of oral cavity; tumors affecting that site are instead classified with cutaneous carcinoma of the head and neck. Moreover, the distinction between lip and oral cavity for T4a criteria has been removed.Nodal staging has changed, as with other head and neck sites, to emphasize extranodal extension.See also oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma mucoepidermoid carcinoma WHO classification of head and neck tumors cervical lymph node levels cervical lymph node staging

It was first described by Graham et. al in 1925, using sodium tetraiodophenolphthalein. Although rarely performed now, more modern techniques used other cholegraphic agents such as iopanoic acid and ipodate.  Following oral administration, the contrast agent gets absorbed by the bowel and concentrated in the gallbladder. Radiolucent gallstones may then be outlined as filling defects on fluoroscopic imaging.

It also inserts on the eyelid 'skeleton' the tarsal plate. It forms connections between the superficial muscular aponeurotic system (SMAS) of the face and frontalis, the temple and the cheek. Laterally the fibers are pierced by the zygomaticofacial nerve which supplies the skin over the zygoma.Orbital partThe orbital part forms the bulk of the muscle, can squeeze the eyelid closed tightly and is used in bright light.Palpebral partHas thinner fibers continuous with the orbital part. It functions to lightly close the eyelid. Lacrimal partForms a small slip originating adjacent to the lacrimal gland to insert on the lateral eyelid. It is thought to promote flow within the gland.

__label__Central __label__Nervous __label__System __label__Head __label__& __label__Neck The orbit is a feature of the face and contains the globe and its supporting structures, as well as many nerves and vessels. On this page:  Article: Gross anatomy Stability of the globe Downward displacement Posterior displacement See also Related articles References   Images:Cases and figures  Gross anatomyIn the adult, the orbit has a volume of approximately 30 mL, of which the globe occupies 6.5 mL. It has a roof, floor, medial and lateral wall. The orbit is open anteriorly where it is bound by the orbital septum, which forms part of the eyelids.

Immediately inferolateral to the optic canal is the superior orbital fissure, through which most neurovascular structures pass. The infratemporal fossa is accessed via the inferior orbital fissure, which is in direct continuation with the infraorbital foramen, through which the infraorbital nerve exits to supply the skin below the eye (and where it is often damaged by a blow-out fracture).Medially, small communications with the paranasal sinuses are via the anterior ethmoidal foramen and posterior ethmoidal foramen.Anteriorly, the supraorbital notch is closed inferiorly by the orbital septum forming a fibrous supraorbital foramen. The nasolacrimal duct drains the nasolacrimal sac via the nasolacrimal foramen.Nerves of the orbitThere are many nerves within the orbit: see orbital nerve supply.Stability of the globeThe fascial sheath of the eye (Tenon's fascia), orbital fat, obliques and bony attachment of the recti provide stability to the eyeball within the orbit and prevent it from sinking or retracting. See article titled 'stability of the eye'. Downward displacementThe fascial sheath of the eye (Tenon's fascia) prevents the eye from sinking. The fascia is applied like a bursa to the back of the eye, from the corneoscleral junction to the attachment of the optic nerve and is thickened over the extraocular muscles.Over the lateral rectus, the tubular prolongation is thickened to form the lateral check ligament, which attaches to the marginal tubercle of Whitnall (bony elevation at the orbital surface of the zygoma). Over the medial rectus, this prolongation is thickened to form the medial check ligament, which attaches to the posterior lacrimal crest (of the lacrimal bone). Between these ligaments, the inferior part of the sheath is thickened to form the suspensory ligament of Lockwood, which supports the eye within the orbit. The eye does not rest on the orbital floor but is held up (in fact, closer to the roof) by the suspensory ligament. As a result, the whole maxilla can be removed with the medial orbital wall up to the marginal tubercle without descent of the eye. Above this level removal of bone destroys the attachment of the suspensory ligament, hence the eye sinks down, and diplopia results. Posterior displacementThe eyes always rotate about a fixed center, which is its own geometrical center. The contracting recti muscles do not displace the eye posteriorly due to: bony attachment of the recti  presence of orbital fat forward pull of the obliques  See alsoorbital pathology
__label__Head __label__& __label__Neck The orbital apex refers to the posterior confluence of the orbit at the craniofacial junction, where nerves and vessels are transmitted from the intracranial compartment into the orbit via several bony apertures. It is also the point where the extra-ocular muscles derive their origins.ContentsThere are three bony apertures that permit the entry of neurovasculature in to the orbit: optic canal superior orbital fissure inferior orbital fissure The four recti extra-ocular muscles originate from the orbital apex at the tendinous ring, surrounding the optic canal.The key structures of the orbital apex have complex anatomical relations: the tendinous ring encircles the optic canal and medial portion of superior orbital fissure  the optic canal lies superomedial to the superior orbital fissure and is separated from it by the inferior root of the lesser wing of the sphenoid; it forms a 45° angle to the head in the sagittal plane and transmits the optic nerve and ophthalmic artery, passing through the tendinous ring the medial part of the superior orbital fissure transmits CN III, VI and nasociliary nerve through the tendinous ring; the superolateral part transmits the frontal and lacrimal nerve, CN IV and superior ophthalmic vein  the inferior orbital fissure is located between the lateral wall and floor of the orbit, its long axis forming a 45° angle to the head in the sagittal plane; transmits the infra-orbital nerve, zygomatic nerve, infra-orbital artery and vein and the inferior ophthalmic vein.

__label__Central __label__Nervous __label__System __label__Trauma Orbital blowout fractures occur when there is a fracture of one of the walls of orbit but the orbital rim remains intact. This is typically caused by a direct blow to the central orbit from a fist or ball. On this page:  Article: Epidemiology Clinical presentation Pathology Radiographic features Treatment and prognosis Differential diagnosis Related articles References   Images:Cases and figures  EpidemiologyThe blowout fracture is the most common type of orbital fracture and is usually the result of trauma. This is reflected in the demographics: it is more prevalent in young men.Clinical presentationOrbital blowout fractures are usually the result of a direct blow to the orbit, which causes a sudden increase in intraorbital pressure. Decompression then occurs by fracture of one or more of the bounding walls of the orbit.Although the causative trauma is usually substantial, presentation and diagnosis may be delayed in the setting of extensive soft tissue swelling and (by definition) an intact orbital rim. In particular, clinical findings of diplopia and restricted ocular motion may be temporarily masked by intraorbital swelling which can compensate for the traumatically-expanded osseous orbital volume 7.Clinical findings associated with orbital blowout fracture may include:  enophthalmos: due to increased orbital volume diplopia: due to extraocular muscle entrapment  orbital emphysema: especially when the fracture is into an adjacent paranasal sinus malar region numbness: due to injury to the inferior orbital nerve  hypoglobus PathologyDifferent types of blowout fractureBlowout fractures can occur through one or more of the orbital walls: inferior (floor) medial wall (lamina papyracea) superior (roof) lateral wall Inferior blowout fractureInferior blowout fractures are the most common. Orbital fat prolapses into the maxillary sinus and may be joined by prolapse of the inferior rectus muscle. In children, the fracture may spring back into place (see trapdoor fracture). Most fractures occur in the floor posterior and medial to the infraorbital groove 5.In ~50% of cases, inferior blowout fractures are associated with fractures of the medial wall 4.Medial blowout fractureMedial blowout fractures are the second most common type, occurring through the lamina papyracea. Orbital fat and the medial rectus muscle may prolapse into the ethmoid air cells.Superior blowout fracturePure superior blowout fractures (without associated orbital rim fracture) are uncommon. They are usually seen in patients with pneumatization of the orbital roof 1,5.Fractures may only involve the sinus, the anterior cranial fossa (less common), or both sinus and anterior cranial fossa. Fractures communicating with the anterior cranial fossa are at risk for CSF leak and meningitis.Lateral blowout fracturePure lateral blowout fractures are rare, as the bone is thick and bounded by muscle. If fractures are present they are usually associated with orbital rim or other significant craniofacial injuries.Radiographic featuresPlain radiographRadiographs are not recommended for the assessment of facial trauma due to poor sensitivity for injury.However, if they are obtained, the diagnosis of fractures involving the inferior or medial wall may be suspected by visualization of fluid with the maxillary sinus and ethmoidal air cells, respectively 4. A few named signs have been described: orbital emphysema may result in a black eyebrow sign  inferior herniation of the intraorbital fat may result in a "teardrop" sign CTCT is the modality of choice for assessment of the facial skeleton. A full assessment does not require the administration of contrast. Ideally, the acquisition should be performed using the thinnest detector settings, enabling thin-slice reconstructions along three orthogonal planes with a bone algorithm. Additional soft tissue algorithm reconstructions using larger slice thickness and 3D volumetric reconstruction are useful for assessing associated soft tissue injury and gauging facial asymmetry, respectively.In addition to evaluating the location and extent of fracture(s), other features requiring assessment and reported include: presence of intra-orbital hemorrhage: may result in stretching or compression of the optic nerve globe injury/rupture  extraocular muscle entrapment: suspected if there is an acute change in angle of the muscle 4  prolapse of orbital fat Several imaging features are associated with late enophthalmos 7: surface area of fracture ≥2 cm 2  ≥25-50% involvement of inferior or medial orbital walls collapse of internal orbital buttress or convex junctional bulge internal orbital buttress located at the union between medial and inferior orbital walls convex junctional bulge is the posterior continuation of the internal orbital buttress, supporting the orbital contents from posterior   intraorbital soft tissue herniation volume ≥1.5 cm 3a linear relationship between the volume of intraorbital contents and depth of enophthalmos 7   Treatment and prognosisManagement of any globe injury generally takes precedence over fractures 7.In general, there has been a trend toward conservative management of orbital blowout fractures. Initial post-traumatic diplopia or extraocular muscle impairment may improve over time, as edema or muscle injury resolves 7,8.For orbital fractures without associated globe injury, immediate surgical management is reserved for cases where the risk of chronic impairment outweighs the risks of surgery. Although the modern transconjunctival incision technique has decreased eyelid complications associated with cutaneous eyelid approaches, surgery in the acute setting remains associated with risk of an iatrogenic eyelid, extraocular muscle, or optic nerve injury 7,8. This is in part because soft tissue swelling may require increased surgical exposure and retraction 7.Potential indications for surgical repair include: significant enophthalmos significant diplopia muscle entrapment, especially with "trapdoor fracture" in children large area fractures The timing of surgery is a subject of debate. Many surgeons elect for semi-delayed or late repair. This allows for assessment for noticeable enophthalmos, diplopia, or extraocular muscle impairment once the swelling has subsided 7,8. This must be balanced against the risk of developing fibrosis and more permanent structural impairment with longer delayed management 7.Differential diagnosisFor old medial orbital blowout fractures consider:lamina papyracea dehiscence
__label__Head __label__& __label__Neck Cavernous venous malformations of the orbit, also known as cavernous hemangiomas, are the most common vascular lesion of the orbit in adults.It is important to note that according to newer nomenclature (ISSVA classification of vascular anomalies) these lesions are merely known as slow flow venous malformations. Having said that, it is probably helpful in reports to include the word 'cavernous' as this term is ubiquitous in the literature and most familiar to many clinicians. Cavernous malformations are found throughout the body. This article focuses on orbital cavernous hemangiomas. For a general discussion please refer to the general article on cavernous venous malformation.  On this page:  Article: Epidemiology Clinical presentation Pathology Radiographic features Treatment and prognosis Differential diagnosis Related articles References   Images: Cases and figures Imaging differential diagnosis   EpidemiologyCavernous hemangiomas are the most common vascular lesions of the orbit in adults and account for 5-7% of all orbital tumors. However, debate exists about whether these lesions should actually be considered tumors 3. They usually present in middle age (30-50 years of age) and there appears to be a female predilection 2,3.Clinical presentationClinical presentation is usually with a slowly growing orbital mass resulting in proptosis. Diplopia and visual field defects (from optic nerve compression) may also occur 3.PathologyCavernous hemangiomas are well-circumscribed masses bounded by a fibrous pseudocapsule, without prominent arterial supply (accounting for the relatively slow enhancement). They are composed of dilated large vascular spaces (thus cavernous) lined by flattened and attenuated endothelial cells 1,3.As flow is slow, and vascular spaces large, areas of thrombosis are common 3,4.Unlike the name 'hemangioma' suggests, these lesions may not be tumors as there is no cellular proliferation 3, but rather gradually enlarging vascular malformations and as such some authors prefer the term cavernous malformation.In some cases prominent fibrosis is present, and these lesions are referred to by some authors as sclerosing hemangiomas 1.Radiographic featuresAlthough cavernous hemangiomas can be located anywhere within the orbit (and for that matter pretty much anywhere in the body: see cavernous venous malformation article) over 80% are located within the intraconal compartment, most commonly in the lateral aspect 1-3.They are usually round or oval in cross-section and although frequently abut the globe, they do not deform it, but rather are deformed by the globe, on account of their soft consistency 1,3.Large lesions may be associated with the expansion of the bony confines of the orbit 3.UltrasoundUltrasound demonstrates a smoothly circumscribed retrobulbar lesion with regular moderate to high internal echogenicity 3-4. No flow can be demonstrated on Doppler scanning 4.CTCavernous hemangioma appears as a well-circumscribed, rounded or oval soft tissue density mass when they are small and becomes deformed due to their soft nature when getting larger; they are somewhat hypoattenuating compared to the muscle which gradually and incompletely fills in following the administration of contrast 1,2.The orbital apex is usually spared 3.Sclerosing hemangiomas sometimes demonstrate calcification 1.MRIAppearance on MRI is the same morphologically as on CT, with the following signal intensities:  T1 isointense compared to muscle if areas of thrombosis are present, then hyperintense regions may be visible 3     T2 hyperintense compared to muscle may have low-intensity septation pseudocapsule is of low intensity    T1 C+ (Gd):  slow gradual irregular enhancement with delayed washout DSAAngiographically hemangiomas are occult as enhancement occurs only in a delayed fashion 2.Treatment and prognosisIf the lesion is found incidentally and no exophthalmos or visual complications are present then conservative management is recommended, with periodic MRI imaging.In cases where symptoms are present, or growth of the lesion is demonstrated on follow-up imaging, surgical removal is curative.Differential diagnosisThe differential depends on the location but is essentially that of orbital vascular lesions with the addition of a few non-vascular tumors.For the more common intra-conal variety the differential includes 1-3: optic nerve meningioma orbital schwannoma hemangiopericytoma sclerosing hemangioma (a variant rather than a distinct entity) orbital metastases orbital fibrous histiocytoma orbital lymphoma orbital venous varix capillary hemangioma of orbit If extraconal the differential also includes 1-3: lacrimal gland tumors schwannoma orbital metastases orbital fibrous histiocytoma orbital lymphoma orbital venous varix 
__label__Head __label__& __label__Neck __label__Trauma Orbital compartment syndrome is an ophthalmological emergency referring to an increased intraorbital pressure that may lead to permanent visual impairment if left untreated. On this page:  Article: Clinical presentation Pathology Radiographic features Treatment and prognosis References   Clinical presentationFeatures usually include: acute visual impairment periorbital bruising fixed, dilated pupil in the affected eye proptosis raised intra-ocular pressure the presence of an afferent pupillary defect restricted extra-ocular muscle movement The condition is often seen in the context of trauma so other signs of trauma, particularly craniofacial, are usually present as well.PathologyThe orbit is a conical space formed by the rigid bony orbit as the apex and the eyelid and orbital septum as the base. The eyelid and septum however are also relatively rigid and movement of the eyelids is also restricted by the medial and lateral canthal ligaments. The orbital compartment is therefore unable to deal with large increases in intraorbital pressure.Causes of increased intraorbital pressure include:  retrobulbar hemorrhage (most commonly from trauma) infection emphysema (tension pneumo-orbitus) post surgical Increased intraorbital pressure can quickly lead compression of the optic nerve and central retinal artery leading to ischemia of the optic nerve and retina.Radiographic featuresCTAlthough the diagnosis of orbital compartment syndrome is a clinical one, CT may show: proptosis tenting of the globe stretching of the optic nerve associated orbital fractures, intracranial hemorrhage and other signs of trauma Treatment and prognosisUrgent decompression by performing a lateral canthotomy and cantholysis is required. Permanent visual damage can occur within one hour if the condition is left untreated.
__label__Head __label__& __label__Neck Several cystic and cyst-like orbital lesions may be encountered in imaging of the orbits:  developmental orbital cysts  choristoma  dermoid: commonest benign orbital tumor in childhood  epidermoid   teratoma  congenital cystic eye colobomatous cyst   acquired abscess hematoma lacrimal gland cyst lymphangioma hydatid cyst   
__label__Head __label__& __label__Neck Orbital dermoid cysts are congenital lesions representing closed sacs lined by an ectodermal epithelium and comprising the most common orbital mass in children. They are typically divided into deep (within the orbit) and superficial (adjacent to the orbital rim). On this page:  Article: Epidemiology Clinical presentation Pathology Radiographic features Treatment and prognosis Differential diagnosis References   Images:Cases and figures  EpidemiologyThey comprise ~2% of orbital tumors 5. Superficial location is much more frequent.Clinical presentationSuperficial angular dermoid is usually diagnosed relatively early. As they grow slowly, less than 25% of them are identified at birth, and they usually manifest in the first decade of life. Clinical features include a painless subcutaneous mass along the zygomaticofrontal and the frontoethmoidal sutures 1,3.It is important to note that more than 80% occur in the upper outer quadrant or the lacrimal fossa (external angular dermoid) 1.Deep dermoids tend to be diagnosed later in life with accompanying proptosis 6.PathologyDermoid cysts are thought to occur as a developmental anomaly in which embryonic ectoderm is trapped in the closing neural tube between the 5th-6th weeks of gestation 1,3.Stratified squamous epithelium lines dermoid cysts, as in epidermoid cysts. Unlike epidermoid cysts, however, they also have epidermal appendages such as hair follicles, sweat glands, and sebaceous glands. The latter is responsible for the secretion of sebum which imparts the characteristic appearance of these lesions on CT and MRI.A common misconception is that dermoid cysts contain adipose tissue. This is not the case, as lipocytes are mesodermal in origin, and dermoid cysts (by definition) are purely ectodermal. A dermoid cyst with adipose tissue would be a teratoma.Radiographic featuresThese lesions are usually extraconal, non-enhancing masses with smooth margins, cystic and/or solid components. They are typically heterogeneous with soft tissue, fluid and fatty (sebum) components; occasionally calcifications may be present.They are most commonly located superotemporally, arising from the zygomaticofrontal suture, followed by superonasally, arising from the frontoethmoidal or frontolacrimal sutures.Ruptured dermoids may show adjacent inflammatory changes.Treatment and prognosisTreatment and prognosis depend on size, location and involvement of orbital structures. While superficial lesion may barely require a cosmetic excision, a deeper one may require more invasive methods involving micro-dissection, orbitotomy, and rarely, intracranial exploration if the lesion extends to that extent 7.Differential diagnosisPossible differential considerations include orbital epidermoid cyst  orbital teratoma usually large lesions and associated with a facial deformity multiloculated cystic masses calcification, fat, and/or ossification may be present   orbital dermolipoma orbital hemangioma

Orbital cellulitis typically occurs as an extension of paranasal sinusitis 1. Endophthalmitis is most commonly secondary to ocular surgery or penetrating injury.Radiographic featuresUrgent imaging is indicated to assess the anatomic extent of disease, including postseptal, cavernous sinus and intracranial involvement; evaluate for sources of contiguous spread, e.g. sinusitis or trauma; and identify orbital abscesses that require exploration and drainage 3.  CT is the imaging investigation of choice as it is: readily available at all hours and quick ideal for assessing for underlying sinus disease will identify a subperiosteal reaction or intracranial extension CTPeriorbital cellulitisDiffuse soft-tissue thickening and areas of enhancement anterior to the orbital septum are seen in periorbital cellulitis.

__label__Head __label__& __label__Neck Primary lymphoma of the orbit is one of the commonest orbital tumors and accounts for as much as half of all orbital malignancies. It is a B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and in most cases arises from mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT). On this page:  Article: Epidemiology Clinical presentation Pathology Radiographic features Treatment and prognosis Differential diagnosis Related articles References   Images: Cases and figures Imaging differential diagnosis   EpidemiologyOrbital lymphomas account for only 2% of all lymphomas but constitute 5-15% of all extranodal lymphomas and approximately 50% of all primary orbital malignancies in adults 1,6.The possible infective etiology may explain the probable increase in the incidence of orbital lymphomas (see below) 3.Typically patients are between 50 and 70 years of age, with no recognized gender predilection 6.Clinical presentationClinical presentation is variable as any part of the orbit can be involved. In 25% of patients, the conjunctiva is involved, in which case patients demonstrate a 'salmon-red patch' of swollen conjunctiva 1. Patients who do not have conjunctival involvement (75% of cases) present with an orbital mass, usually in the superior lateral quadrant, in proximity to the lacrimal gland 1,6: palpable mass exophthalmos ptosis diplopia and abnormal ocular movement Generally the mass is painless; however, a subset of patients demonstrates inflammatory-like changes, including pain, erythema, and swelling 1.Direct infiltration of the globe and/or optic nerve is rare, and vision is usually preserved 1.Primary orbital lymphoma (by definition) is Stage 1E disease (see: staging of non-Hodgkin lymphoma).PathologyOrbital lymphoma is a B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and in most cases arises from mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (i.e. orbital adnexal MALT lymphoma (OAML)): 50-78% of cases in Western nations, and up to 90% of cases from Japan and Korea 1. It is unclear, however, if MALT exists normally in the conjunctiva of the eye, or whether it represents a sequela of inflammation (thus the potential link to chlamydial infection). The orbit is otherwise believed to be bereft of lymphatic tissue or lymphatic drainage 1.Non-OAML tumors are of a variety of histologies, with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma being relatively common 4. Recently an association between Chlamydia psittaci infection and orbital adnexal MALT lymphoma has been described 1-2. Infection by Chlamydia psittaci is usually the result of exposure to infected birds and household pets. Patients may go on to develop psittacosis, usually with respiratory tract manifestations 3. Radiographic featuresOrbital lymphoma usually appears as a soft tissue mass, either involving the conjunctiva (especially in the case of orbital adnexal MALT lymphoma (OAML)) or elsewhere in the orbit, frequently in the upper outer quadrant, closely associated with the lacrimal gland. Although the extraocular muscles may be surrounded or displaced by the mass, they can usually be identified as not being the origin of the tumor, helpful in distinguishing lymphomas from other orbital masses.Invasion of the globe or optic nerve is rare.Ultrasoundcontent pendingCTOn non-contrast CT, the mass is usually homogeneous in density, either isodense or slightly hyperdense when compared to the extraocular muscles 1. Following administration of contrast, only mild to moderate enhancement is seen, similar again to the extraocular muscles and lacrimal gland. MRISimilar to intracranial lymphoma, the densely cellular nature of these tumors with high nucleus-to-cytoplasm ratio results in relatively specific appearances 1,5:Signal characteristics include:  T1: iso- to hypointense to muscle  T2: iso- to hyperintense to muscle  T1 C+ (Gd): homogeneous enhancement  DWI: increased signal intensity - restricted diffusion  ADC: reduced values - restricted diffusion Treatment and prognosisOrbital adnexal MALT lymphoma (OAML) have a better prognosis than other types of orbital lymphomas and are, not surprisingly, more often conjunctival. The recent identification of Chlamydia psittaci as a likely important causative factor in the increasing incidence of orbital lymphomas has lead to antibiotic therapy being used to reduce the size of the tumor and in some cases results in remission 1-3.Surgical biopsy/resection, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy have all been used. Currently, no OAML treatment guidelines exist 1. An overall 5-year relapse-free rate of 65% is reported, with less than 5% of patients with OAML eventually dying from the disease 1. Systemic dissemination is only seen in 5-10% of cases 1.Similarly, in cases of non-MALT-lymphoma, a combination of two or more of surgical biopsy/resection, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy is usually employed. Prognosis is less favourable.Differential diagnosisGeneral imaging differential considerations include: other malignancies orbital rhabdomyosarcoma uveal melanoma lacrimal gland tumors  orbital metastases (including disseminated lymphoma)    idiopathic orbital inflammatory pseudotumor may be difficult to distinguish from lymphoma if associated with fibrosis, will be of lower T2 signal 5    thyroid-associated orbitopathy

__label__Head __label__& __label__Neck __label__Oncology Orbital metastases are relatively uncommon, but some primary tumors do have a predilection to metastasize to the orbit.This article concerns itself with extraocular metastases, rather than intraocular tumors or direct extension of tumors from neighboring regions. For a discussion of intraocular metastases please refer to uveal metastases. On this page:  Article: Epidemiology Clinical presentation Pathology Radiographic features Treatment and prognosis Differential diagnoses References   Images: Cases and figures Imaging differential diagnosis   EpidemiologyExtraocular orbital metastases are uncommon, accounting for 2-11% of all orbital neoplasms, and significantly less common than uveal metastases, which outnumber orbital metastases by 8 to 1 1,3,6. The demographics of affected patients reflect the demographics of the primary tumors (see below). Clinical presentationIn general, patients with metastatic disease do not develop orbital metastases, being identified clinically in <1% of cases. Prevalence is much higher in autopsy series, reflecting the high prevalence of asymptomatic orbital deposits 7.In ~40% of patients who are symptomatic from orbital metastases (except for breast cancer metastases), orbital symptoms occur well before local symptoms from the primary tumor manifest, and as such is the first indication of advanced malignancy 1,3,6. Unlike primary orbital tumors which most frequently present with proptosis and/or visual loss, orbital metastases most commonly present with diplopia 1. Pain is also frequently present. Enophthalmos due to infiltration and desmoplasia is most frequently encountered with breast carcinoma metastases, although it may also be occasionally seen in metastases from gastrointestinal tract adenocarcinoma 4. This may be associated with hypoglobus.Diagnosis is often known and widespread metastatic disease offers easier targets for biopsy. In cases where orbital metastases are isolated, a biopsy may be required to establish the diagnosis. This is usually performed as an open biopsy, to allow for adequate hemostasis 1,3.PathologyIn adults, orbital metastases can be due to many different primaries 1-6 breast cancer bronchogenic cancer prostate cancer gastrointestinal adenocarcinoma thyroid carcinoma renal cell carcinoma neuroblastoma Ewing sarcoma Wilms tumor  leukemia 9   pancreatic adenocarcinoma 10   endometrial carcinoma 11   ovarian carcinoma 12   melanoma 13   urothelial carcinoma of the urinary bladder 14   non-Hodgkin lymphoma 15   seminoma of testis 16  ​ In children, the vast majority of orbital metastases are due to neuroblastoma 17.Radiographic featuresIn contrast to uveal metastases which can be bilateral (up to 25%), extraocular orbital metastases are usually unilateral (with the exception of neuroblastoma) 7, and only infrequently primarily involve the extraocular muscles (with the exception of melanoma) 7, although secondary involvement as the metastasis grows is common 1,2. Thyroid and prostate metastases are frequently located in the bony margins of the orbit 7.The superior lateral extraconal quadrant is most frequently involved although all parts of the orbit may be the site of metastatic deposit.CTCT appearances are variable. In most instances, soft tissue attenuating material is identified, located in the extraconal compartment 6. The morphology is variable, ranging from well-defined rounded lesions to diffusely infiltrating lesions 5.In general, enhancement is present. Bony destruction may also sometimes be seen, and careful assessment of the remainder of the scan essential in identifying additional deposits.MRIMRI appearances are similar to CT, but the greater contrast resolution of MRI makes it invaluable in the assessment of orbital masses.Fat-suppressed T2 and post-contrast T1 weighted images, with thin slice thickness and a reduced FOV is ideal and should include the cavernous sinuses.  T1: isointense to muscle 8   T2: hyperintense to muscle, hypointense to fat  T1 C+ (Gd): enhancement present but variable Treatment and prognosisTreatment is primarily with radiotherapy, typically with a total dose of 30-40 Gy 1. Depending on the tumor histology chemotherapy may also be useful. Surgery is usually limited to patients with isolated orbital involvement without an identifiable (or a previously treated) primary.Unfortunately, the discovery of orbital metastases usually indicates advanced and widespread metastatic disease and prognosis are dismal with the majority of patients succumbing to their illness within a year (average time from diagnosis to death is 4 months) 7.Differential diagnoses  primary orbital malignancy orbital rhabdomyosarcoma orbital lymphoma lacrimal gland tumors   extraocular extension of an intraocular tumor uveal melanoma uveal metastases   tumors of the optic nerve optic nerve glioma optic nerve meningioma   orbital vascular lesion orbital infection thyroid-associated orbitopathy inflammatory/granulomatous conditions orbital pseudotumor granulomatosis with polyangiitis sarcoidosis

__label__Head __label__& __label__Neck __label__Oncology Orbital pathology covers a variety of diverse diseases that affect the orbit. The complicating factor is that the orbit is composed of a large number of different tissues which each have a plethora of pathologies that can affect them. ClassificationFor simplification, they can be separated into developmental, inflammatory, vascular and neoplastic categories:Developmental dermoid cyst mucocoele retro-ocular cyst Inflammatory inflammatory change in tissues around the orbit periorbital tissues: orbital infection   optic nerve: optic neuritis   sclera: scleritis   extraocular muscles: myositis,  Graves disease    complete orbital inflammation: panophthalmitis  pseudotumor of orbit Vascular cavernous angioma capillary angioma lymphangioma orbital venous varix carotid-cavernous fistula Neoplastic rhabdomyosarcoma of the orbit optic nerve glioma optic nerve sheath meningioma orbital lymphoma orbital metastasis See alsoorbital mass
__label__Head __label__& __label__Neck The orbital septum is a thin sheet of fibrous tissue that originates from the orbital rim periosteum and blends with the tendon of the levator palpebrae superioris superiorly and inserts into the tarsal plate inferiorly.The orbital septum separates the intra-orbital fat from eyelid fat and orbicularis oculi muscle, and also provides a barrier against spread of infection between the preseptal space to postseptal space (orbit proper) 1.Radiographic appearanceCTThe orbital septum difficult to identify but appears in the region that contains the separation of the orbital fat from the subcutaneous (eyelid) fat and the orbicularis oculi muscle and together with the eye lids and cornjunctiva forms an anterior soft tissue density 2. MRI High-resolution T1WI is a superior imaging technique to depict orbital septum and hence determine boundaries between preseptal and postseptal spaces which have important implication in treatment of periorbital infections or anatomic staging of tumors. See alsoorbital infection

__label__Head __label__& __label__Neck __label__Vascular Orbital venous varix (OVV) is an uncommon vascular malformation that is composed of enlarged single or multiple tubular venous channels with direct communication to the systemic venous system.  On this page:  Article: Terminology Epidemiology Clinical presentation Radiographic features Treatment and prognosis Differential diagnosis References   Images: Cases and figures Imaging differential diagnosis   TerminologyOrbital venous varices are divided into primary and secondary. Primary orbital varices are idiopathic and most likely congenital. They are confined to the orbit.Secondary orbital venous varices are those that are acquired due to increased blood flow as a result of intracranial arteriovenous malformations, caroticocavernous fistula, dural arteriovenous fistula, etc., which drain via the orbit 2,4. Secondary varix occurs in association with VGAMs and occasionally with venous angiomas. There may be isolated segmental saccular or fusiform dilatation of cortical veins. The remainder of this article concerns itself with primary orbital venous varices.EpidemiologyOrbital varix is a rare entity, accounting for less than 1.3% of all orbital tumors 2. Although it is believed to be congenital, and thus present at birth, patients typically do not become symptomatic until later childhood or early adulthood (10-30 years of age). Cases have however been reported at essentially any age 2.Clinical presentationTypically these lesions present due to intermittent diplopia or proptosis during episodes of straining or prone/stooping positioning 1-3. The protracted distension can actually create more room for the globe to fall back into when not distended leading to paradoxical enophthalmos when at rest 1.Presentation may also be due to a complication. Orbital venous varices are the most common causes of intraorbital hemorrhage. They may also become acutely symptomatic if they thrombose. In such cases, patients report the acute onset of retro-orbital pain, proptosis and decreased visual acuity 1-2.Rarely, larger lesions involving the superior ophthalmic vein may present as a lacrimal region mass 3.AssociationsThere is a reported association with venous anomalies intracranially which may or may not directly communicate with varix 1.Radiographic featuresWithout provocative examination (Valsalva maneuver) they can be very difficult or impossible to diagnose, as varix may completely collapse. Contrast-enhanced studies will demonstrate venous phase opacification with enlargement and possibly proptosis on straining.Radiograph As with the rest of head and neck imaging, plain films have little if any role in modern radiology. If performed, however, the presence of calcified phleboliths are characteristic 1.UltrasoundUltrasound is an excellent non-invasive modality for assessment of the orbit and can be performed easily with various dynamic maneuvers (e.g. Valsalva maneuver) and in various positions (e.g. sitting vs. lying). Additionally, color Doppler can also give an insight into the flow dynamics of a vascular lesion. In upright posture and at rest no abnormality may be seen. On straining, venous channels dilate and are associated with increased blood flow. Proptosis may be visible 2.CTIf the diagnosis is suspected contrast CT should be performed both at rest and with a Valsalva maneuver, as in some instances no abnormality is visible on routine imaging, and change in size is helpful in distinguishing this entity from other vascular lesions of the orbit. Non-contrast orbital scan may demonstrate phleboliths. Contrast should be administered during the Valsalva phase. Varix will appear as an irregular or smooth enhancing lesion which significantly increases in size with straining, typically located at the orbital apex 2. Enhancement should match that of other venous structures (e.g. cavernous sinus).In the setting of thrombosis, the enhancement may be absent, and no change on the Valsalva maneuver will be detected. MRIMRI should also be performed with Valsalva or straining. However, since the acquisition time is longer than CT, some patients may find it difficult.In the absence of thrombosis:  T1: hypointense c.f. extraocular muscles  T2: hypointense c.f. extraocular muscles If thrombosis is present the imaging is more variable:  T1: heterogeneous with areas of high signal (see aging of blood on MRI)  T2: heterogeneous with areas of high signal (see aging of blood on MRI) Treatment and prognosisThese lesions are usually only treated if symptomatic (either due to mass effect or thrombosis/hemorrhage).The anterior part of varix can usually be relatively easily excised surgically if thrombosed but may be difficult to identify in a supine patient if no thrombosis is present 2. Subtotal excision may result in recurrence, and repeat treatment is often more complicated. Ideally, the vein should be resected or clipped as far back towards the orbital apex as possible 3.Catheterization of the varix may be performed either via the endovascular route (via jugular vein and cavernous sinus) or directly after surgical exposure. Injection of glue/onyx or introduction of micro coils may be beneficial in allowing the surgeon to identify and excise the lesion and reduce intra-operative bleeding 2-4.Differential diagnosisAn orbital venous varix without thrombosis has a limited differential if dynamic views have been performed. Other orbital vascular lesions to be considered in the differential include: cavernous venous malformation orbital lymphangioma  secondary orbital venous varix intracranial arteriovenous malformations caroticocavernous fistula dural arteriovenous fistula   It should be noted that there is confusion and controversy in the literature as to the precise definitions of orbital vascular malformation with a venous component (e.g. varix, lymphangioma, venous malformation).When thrombosis has occurred the differential is broader and is essentially that of an orbital mass: orbital metastases orbital rhabdomyosarcoma orbital lymphoma  orbital neurofibroma / schwannoma lacrimal gland tumors 
__label__Central __label__Nervous __label__System __label__Vascular The orbitofrontal arteries, or frontobasal arteries, supply the orbitofrontal cortex. They consist of both medial and lateral orbitofrontal arteries.Gross anatomyThe medial orbitofrontal artery (MOFA) is most commonly the first branch of the A2 segment of the anterior cerebral artery. It arises distal to the anterior communicating artery and passes anteriorly and inferiorly towards the anterior cranial fossa and passes around the gyrus rectus.  It terminates at the orbitofrontal cortex, supplying the orbital gyri and inferomedial portion of the frontal lobe.The lateral orbitofrontal artery (LOFA) is variable in its origin, however, is most commonly the first cortical branch of the superior trunk of the middle cerebral artery bifurcation. The LOFA passes between the frontal and temporal lobes from posteroinferior to anterosuperior to arrive at the posterolateral orbitofrontal cortex surface. Here it primarily supplies the lateral orbitofrontal cortex.
__label__Central __label__Nervous __label__System The orbitomeatal line, also known as the canthomeatal line, was the traditional axial plane used for CT of the brain. It was easily identified on the inspection of the patient's head when tilting the gantry or patient's head to achieve a standard axial plane. The orbitomeatal line was defined as running from the outer canthus of the eye to the midpoint of the external auditory meatus 1,2. This plane fell out of favor for CT of the brain as it generated significantly elevated doses to the lens compared to planes that avoid the orbit 1. Until recently the standard plane for CT of the brain in most departments was along the roof of the orbit, seen easily on the CT scout. This had the advantage of including the posterior fossa but avoiding the lens. More recently, with volumetric scans becoming standard, and many CT scanners no longer being able to tilt, the whole head is scanned and then axial images are reconstructed at any desired angle. As such many departments are switching the standard axial CT brain plane to be aligned with the AC-PC line which is standard in MRI 2,3. Interestingly, this plane is quite close to the original orbitometal line and to the plane of the planum sphenoidale and hard palate.

__label__Central __label__Nervous __label__System __label__Chest __label__Forensic Organophosphate poisoning is an important cause of acute neurological dysfunction and respiratory distress. On this page:  Article: Epidemiology Clinical presentation Pathology Radiographic features Treatment and prognosis Differential diagnosis Related articles References   EpidemiologyOrganophosphate poisoning is common, often as a result of suicidal ingestion (acute high-level exposure) or occupational exposure to pesticides (chronic low-level exposure) 1. It is thought that worldwide, approximately 3 million people are exposed to toxic levels of organophosphates, including approximately 2 million hospitalizations for suicidal ingestion 1.Clinical presentationAcute organophosphate poisoning leads to three distinct sequential neurological syndromes.  acute cholinergic crisis and paralysis (type I paralysis) it is characterized by an acute muscarinic syndrome that manifests within hours of initial toxic exposure, and is soon afterwards followed by an acute nicotinic syndrome 2,3  the features of the muscarinic syndrome are helpfully summarized by the popular mnemonic 'SLUDGEM-BBB': salivation, lacrimation, urination, diarrhea, gastric cramps, emesis, miosis, bronchorrhea, bronchospasm, bradycardia 2  the features of the nicotinic syndrome are not in the mnemonic (and thus are often forgotten) but include fasciculations and muscle weakness 2  seizures may also occur acutely 2     intermediate syndrome (type II paralysis) this is a continuation or extension of the nicotinic syndrome that manifests days after initial toxic exposure 2,3  it is characterized by continued paralysis, with prominent involvement of neck flexors, ocular muscles, bulbar muscles, and respiratory muscles 2,3  some patients may also exhibit extrapyramidal symptoms (e.g. parkinsonism, choreoathetosis) 2,3     organophosphate-induced delayed polyneuropathy (type III paralysis) this is an uncommon syndrome that occurs weeks after initial toxic exposure 2,3  it is characterized by a symmetric and predominantly motor axonal neuropathy leading to flaccid limb weakness 2    With chronic exposure to low-dose organophosphates, the chronic organophosphate-induced neuropsychiatric disorder may manifest 4. This is characterized by fatigue, memory impairment, extrapyramidal symptoms, autonomic dysfunction, and peripheral neuropathy 4. Interestingly, cholinergic symptoms of a muscarinic syndrome are not a feature of chronic low-dose exposure 4.PathologyOrganophosphates are agents that bind to acetylcholinesterase and inhibit its action of normally hydrolyzing acetylcholine 2,5. Acetylcholine is a neurotransmitter that is found at neuronal synapses and neuromuscular junctions, and acts on acetylcholine receptors, namely the muscarinic (mAChR) and nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChR) 2,5.Muscarinic acetylcholine receptors are predominantly involved in the activation of the parasympathetic nervous system, but are also found in the central nervous system 2,5. Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors are located at the neuromuscular junction (muscle-type nicotinic acetylcholine receptors), but also upstream in the central and peripheral nervous systems (neuronal-type nicotinic acetylcholine receptors) 2,5.In acute organophosphate poisoning, there is overactivation of both muscarinic and nicotinic receptors, resulting in the acute muscarinic and nicotinic syndromes, as described above 2. The intermediate syndrome is a sequelae of the acute nicotinic syndrome, and is due to a depletion in acetylcholine at the neuromuscular junction 2. Additionally, in the basal ganglia, this results in a neurotoxicity and relative dopamine excess, which accounts for the extrapyramidal symptoms that are sometimes also seen in the intermediate syndrome 6. Neurotoxicity disproportionally affects the basal ganglia due to their high metabolic demand and rich vasculature 6.The mechanism underlying organophosphate-induced delayed polyneuropathy is not well understood, but is thought to be independent to the functioning of both muscarinic and nicotinic receptors, and may be due to inhibition of the enzyme neurotoxic esterase instead 2. Similarly, the mechanism behind the chronic organophosphate-induced neuropsychiatric disorder is also poorly understood 4.Radiographic featuresImaging is generally only remarkable in the brain (the focus of this section), however some patients may also develop a chemical aspiration pneumonitis which may produce findings on chest imaging 7. Generally, brain imaging findings only become apparent during the intermediate syndrome, and are reversible within weeks.CTCT brain may show hypoattenuation bilaterally in the basal ganglia 8. Generally, and unlike other toxic encephalopathies, these areas do not show evidence of hyperattenuating macroscopic hemorrhage.MRISimilar to CT, symmetric and bilateral involvement of the basal ganglia may be appreciated on MRI brain during the intermediate syndrome 3,6. In particular, the putamen and caudate nuclei are predominantly affected 3,6. Signal characteristics include 3,6:  T1: low signal   T2/FLAIR: high signal   T1 C+ (Gd): usually minimal or absent contrast enhancement  DWI: increased diffusion signal Two case reports have also described lesions, with the same signal characteristics, in the cerebellum 3,9. Additionally, one case study has described an eye of the tiger sign in a case of organophosphate poisoning, whereby there was central T2 high signal with a low signal rim in the globus pallidus bilaterally, suggestive of a hemorrhagic necrosis 10. It is likely that these are atypical radiographic manifestations of acute organophosphate poisoning.Importantly, all signal changes completely resolve within weeks to months 6. Unlike other toxic encephalopathies, such as methanol poisoning, cystic sequelae usually do not eventuate 6.Treatment and prognosisAcute management is generally with resuscitation and pharmacotherapy such as atropine, an agent that competes with acetylcholine at muscarinic receptors, and pralidoxime, an agent that reactivates acetylcholinesterases at both the muscarinic and nicotinic receptors 2. This acute care often takes place in an intensive care unit 2.There is currently no treatment for the intermediate syndrome or organophosphate-induced delayed polyneuropathy, and patients with those manifestations should be managed symptomatically 2,4.Differential diagnosisFor involvement in and around the basal ganglia, consider: mitochondrial encephalopathies Leigh disease Kearns-Sayre syndrome   other toxic encephalopathies carbon monoxide neurotoxicity cyanide neurotoxicity methanol neurotoxicity   metabolic disordersWilson disease  prion encephalopathiesCreutzfeldt-Jakob disease

__label__Oncology __label__Head __label__& __label__Neck Oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) is the most common type of head and neck cancer in the Western world 1. Typically it will be further categorized based on the specific anatomical location involved within the oropharynx, as this may affect prognosis and modality of treatment.  On this page:  Article: Epidemiology Clinical presentation Pathology Radiographic features Treatment and prognosis References   Images:Cases and figures  EpidemiologyEpidemiology and risk factors are similar to elsewhere in the aerodigestive tract. Traditionally, the major risk factors for OPSCC are alcohol and tobacco 2.These remain important risk factors, however, in recent years there has been an increasing incidence of OPSCC caused by human papillomavirus (HPV). HPV associated OPSCC tend to occur in a younger population group, and may feature more rapid growth of disease and more pronounced locoregional lymph node involvement 3. However, they also tend to respond better to chemoradiotherapy treatment and carry a better overall prognosis 2. For this reason, OPSCC is often subcategorised into HPV-associated (or p16 positive) or non-HPV-associated (or p16 negative) OPSCC. HPV positive cases of OPSCC are typically caused by HPV subtype 16, which is also the subtype associated with cervical cancer. Clinical presentationOPSCC has a varied presentation depending on the specific anatomical site of origin. Common presenting symptoms include odynophagia and dysphagia. Because of the propensity for HPV-associated OPSCC to have early nodal involvement, they may also present with a neck mass. PathologyAs per the 2017 8th edition American Journal Committee on Cancer (AJCC) guidelines, OPSCC are categorized into HPV/p16 positive and HPV/p16 negative, as these are different patterns of disease and carry very different prognoses. LocationCommon subtypes of OPSCC include tonsil, base of tongue and soft palate, however, anywhere in the oropharynx can be involved. For the purposes of staging, the lingual surface of the epiglottis is excluded and considered part of the larynx, and the nasopharyngeal surface of the soft palate is considered part of the nasopharynx. Staging oropharyngeal (p16-negative) cancer staging HPV-mediated (p16-positive) oropharyngeal cancer staging Radiographic featuresCTCT will typically show an asymmetric soft tissue mass with contrast enhancement within the aerodigestive tract. In more advanced disease there may be loss of normal fat planes as the tumor extends beyond its site of origin. Careful assessment of neck lymph nodes is essential for OPSCC primary malignancies. Involved lymph nodes are usually referred to in terms of neck lymph node levels. Features of nodal involvement include short-axis diameter greater than 10 mm, asymmetry, and loss of fatty hilum. Metastatic lymph nodes may sometimes demonstrate cystic change or central necrosis 2.  Signs of nodal extracapsular extension include loss of adjacent fat planes, irregular capsular enhancement, and ill-defined margins 2. HPV associated OPSCC have a high tendency for nodal metastasis, particularly within the level II nodal station. The most common cause of metastatic lymph node involvement within the level II region is metastasis from a p16 positive OPSCC 4. Treatment and prognosisTreatment options depend on the stage and location of the disease, as well as patient factors and suitability for different treatment options. The three primary modalities of radical treatment are surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Another systemic option that is a current area of active research is immunotherapy. HPV positive OPSCC tends to have a much better prognosis than HPV negative OPSCC. The estimated 5-year survival for HPV positive OPSCC is 90%, compared with 40% for HPV negative cases 5.

__label__Musculoskeletal The orthogonal projection (or view) is, by definition, a radiographic projection obtained 90 degrees to the original view. It forms the basic requirements of a 'radiographic series', that being 'two orthogonal projections of the region of interest' On this page:  Article: Acute imaging  Foreign body imaging See also   Images:Cases and figures  Acute imaging Cases can appear normal in one projection; abnormal in the next (case 5) consequently plain radiographic imaging in the acute setting is seldom a single projection, often comprising of two or more angles of the same region. Orthogonal projections in the acute setting are necessary to convey the three-dimensional nature of the anatomy in question. One should always strive to perform (as radiographers) or request (as referrers) orthogonal views. When orthogonal views are not possible, views taken at an alternative angle to the first is still more beneficial than no second view at all.Foreign body imagingPlain radiographic investigations of foreign bodies often require orthogonal projections to better understand the position in relation to anatomical structures. The orthogonal projections of foreign bodies are often known as the 'en face' projection, whereby the radiographer performs imaging orthogonal to the foreign body rather than anatomical structures.See alsoradiographic positioning terminology

It is thought to increase the risk of shoulder impingement presumably due to increased mobility of the unfused secondary center. There is, however, no statistical difference in the incidence of supraspinatus and infraspinatus tears between patients with os acromiale and a normal control group 3. A step-off deformity of the os acromiale is associated with a greater incidence of rotator cuff tears than those without such deformity 3. Gross anatomySubtypesThe subtypes develop due to the fusion pattern of the three acromial ossification centers (preacromion, mesoacromion and meta-acromion) 4 and are classified on their pattern of articulation with the acromion (from proximal to distal) 5: basiacromial meta-acromial mesoacromial preacromial Meta- and mesoacromial are the most common 5. PathologyThe acromion normally has a secondary center of ossification which usually fuses to the rest of the acromion by the age of 25. An os acromiale merely represents the persistence of this center without bony fusion.It may cause shoulder impingement, rotator cuff tear or degenerative acromioclavicular joint disease 5. Acromial apophysiolysis in young patients is considered a risk factor for the development of an os acromiale.Radiographic featuresPlain radiographThe unfused anterior acromial ossification center is best seen on axillary views.Ultrasound os acromiale readily identified in patients with pathology (e.g. rotator cuff tears) advantage of dynamic imaging and reproducing symptoms 6  MRIAn os acromiale is readily identified if care is taken to examine the acromion in the superior axial plane as it can easily be mistaken for the normal acromioclavicular joint. History and etymologyOs acromiale is from Ancient Greek, "os" is bone, and "acromiale" is a possessive form of "acromion", a compound word: akros (άκρος) "highest", ōmos (ώμος), "shoulder". Differential diagnosisPossible considerations include  normal acromioclavicular joint: note that acromion fusion may not occur till around 18-25 years of age 6. degenerative ossicles fracture of the acromion calcific tendinosis of the supraspinatus 
__label__Musculoskeletal Osborne-Cotterill lesions represent a shear or depression fracture of the posteroinferior aspect of the capitellum and an avulsed fragment in posterolateral elbow most commonly seen in patients with chronic posterolateral rotatory instability. PathologyIt is thought to be due to posterolateral subluxation or dislocation during hyperextension of the elbow joint which can result in kissing contusion or impaction of the anterior radial head into posteroinferior capitellum with resultant depressed fracture or contusion as well as in some instances avulsion of the humeral attachment of the lateral ulnar collateral ligament. The mechanism is similar to that of Hill-Sachs deformity and Bankart lesions in anterior shoulder dislocations.History and etymologyOsborne and Cotterill first described an osteochondral fracture in the posterolateral margin of the capitellum with or without a defect in the radial head in patients with recurrent elbow joint dislocation and posterolateral instability in 1966. In 2008,  Morrey et al. suggested the term "Osborne-Cotterill lesion" for this condition.

__label__Musculoskeletal The os epilunate is an accessory ossicle of the wrist that lies at the dorsal surface of the lunocapitate articulation. For this reason it can be mistaken for a loose body within this articulation 1.

__label__Musculoskeletal __label__Paediatrics Osgood-Schlatter disease (OSD) is a chronic fatigue injury due to repeated microtrauma at the patellar ligament insertion onto the tibial tuberosity, usually affecting boys between ages 10-15 years. On this page:  Article: Epidemiology Clinical presentation Radiographic features Treatment and prognosis History and etymology Differential diagnosis Related articles References   Images: Cases and figures Imaging differential diagnosis   EpidemiologyOsgood-Schlatter disease is seen in active adolescents, especially those who jump and kick, which is why it is seen more frequently in boys. It is bilateral in 25-50% of patients 1-3. The typical age of onset in females may be slightly earlier (boys 10-15 years; girls 8-12 years) 8.Clinical presentationClinically, patients present with pain and swelling over the tibial tuberosity exacerbated with exercise.Radiographic featuresPlain radiographSoft tissue swelling with loss of the sharp margins of the patellar tendon are the earliest signs in the acute phase; thus, a compatible history is also essential in making the diagnosis. Bone fragmentation at the tibial tuberosity may be evident 3 to 4 weeks after the onset.It is important not to equate isolated 'fragmentation' of the apophysis with OSD, as there may well be secondary ossification centers.UltrasoundUltrasound examination of the patellar tendon can depict the same anatomic abnormalities as can plain radiographs, CT scans, and magnetic resonance images. The sonographic appearances of Osgood-Schlatter disease include 3: swelling of the unossified cartilage and overlying soft tissues fragmentation and irregularity of the ossification center with reduced internal echogenicity  thickening of the distal patellar tendon infrapatellar bursitis MRIMRI, as expected, is more sensitive and specific, and will demonstrate: soft-tissue swelling anterior to the tibial tuberosity loss of the sharp inferior angle of the infrapatellar fat pad (Hoffa fat pad) thickening and edema of the distal patellar tendon  infrapatellar bursitis (clergyman's knee)a distended deep infrapatellar bursa can be a frequent finding 6   bone marrow edema may be seen at the tibial tuberosity Treatment and prognosisTreatment is usually conservative and involves rest, ice, activity modification (decreasing activities that stress the insertion, especially jumping and lunging sports), and quadriceps and hamstring strengthening exercises. Analgesia and padding to prevent pressure on the tibial tuberosity are also useful. Only rarely are therapeutic casts required 4,5.The condition spontaneously resolves once the physis closes.In rare cases, surgical excision of the bone fragment(s) and/or free cartilaginous material may give good results in skeletally mature patients who remain symptomatic despite conservative measures. Unresolved OSD is the term given to clinical and radiological findings of OSD that persist into adulthood.History and etymologyIt is named after American orthopedic surgeon Robert B Osgood (1873-1956) and Swiss professor of surgery Carl Schlatter (1864-1934). Differential diagnosisImaging differential considerations include:  Sinding-Larsen-Johansson disease (SLJ): similar condition involving the inferior pole of the patella  jumper's knee: involves the patellar tendon rather than the bone, and is essentially a tendinopathy with focal tenderness, although it may eventually be associated with bony changes (some authors do not distinguish between SLJ and jumper's knee) infrapatellar bursitis 
__label__Musculoskeletal The hook of the hamate has its own ossification center, which may fail to fuse with the body of the hamate, creating an ossicle. This ossicle is referred to as an os hamuli proprium or unfused hamulus In some instances, this can be difficult to distinguish from a fracture of the hook, but is suggested when the finding is bilateral, being observed in the asymptomatic side as well. If visible, smooth corticated margins at this site also support this finding. See alsohook of hamate fracture
__label__Musculoskeletal The os hypolunatum is an accessory ossicle of the wrist seen lying between the scaphoid and lunate carpal bones, lying at the most proximal border of the capitate bone 1.

It can have a variety of shapes: round oval bean-shaped linear resemble a rudimentary metatarsal  ClassificationIt can be classified into three basic types:  free standing: it is a completely independent ossicle, and it does not show any osseous or articular connection with any structure  articulating: it may form a synovial joint with first or second metatarsal or the medial cuneiform   fused: it forms a spur that is seen as a bony projection in the first and second intermetatarsal space 
__label__Central __label__Nervous __label__System Osmotic demyelination syndrome refers to acute demyelination seen in the setting of osmotic changes, typically with the rapid correction of hyponatremia. It is the more recent term replacing central pontine myelinolysis, recognizing that extrapontine structures can also be affected, previously known as extrapontine myelinolysis.  On this page:  Article: Epidemiology Clinical presentation Pathology Radiographic features Treatment and prognosis Differential diagnosis References   Images: Cases and figures Imaging differential diagnosis   EpidemiologyThe initial description of central pontine myelinolysis by Adams et al. in 1959 2 was entirely in a population of chronic alcoholics, and certainly, this scenario is common. Since then it has been increasingly recognized in other patient groups, but usually in the setting of rapidly corrected electrolyte disturbance: chronic alcoholics chronically debilitated patients transplant recipients Clinical presentationClinically osmotic demyelination syndrome presents in a biphasic pattern. The first phase is usually attributable not to the demyelination but rather to the inciting electrolyte abnormality, with patients being acutely encephalopathic. Following rapid reversal of this abnormality, the patient transiently improves before progressing onto the classic osmotic demyelination syndrome features 2-3 days later. When pontine involvement is prominent, clinical features consist of: spastic quadriparesis pseudobulbar palsy changes in levels of consciousness coma death PathologyAlthough the exact mechanism is still uncertain, it is known that oligodendroglial cells are most susceptible to osmotic stresses, leading to their demise. It is not surprising that the distribution of osmotic myelinolysis, therefore, parallels the distribution of these cells.Histologically, osmotic demyelination syndrome is characterized by intramyelinic splitting, vacuolation and myelin sheath rupture 3. After many days, macrophages can be identified.Radiographic featuresCTCT may demonstrate low attenuation crossing the midline in the lower pons. However, CT assessment of the skull base can be difficult due to beam hardening artifact and, if available, MRI is preferred.MRIThe earliest change is seen on DWI with restriction in the lower pons. This is seen within 24 hours of the onset of quadriplegia 3. This same region demonstrates eventual high T2 signal and later low T1 signal. The T1 and T2 changes may take up to two weeks to develop. This region has a classic trident shaped appearance. The overall appearance on T2/FLAIR axial MR images has also been likened to the face of a pig, referred to as piglet sign. Occasionally gadolinium enhancement is also demonstrated, just as in the acute phase of multiple sclerosis (MS) plaque. The peripheral fibers (ventrolateral longitudinal fibers), as well as the periventricular and subpial regions, are typically spared.Similar appearances are seen in other parts of the brain: basal ganglia, midbrain and subcortical white matter. Signal characteristics of the affected region include:  T1: mildly or moderately hypointense  T2: hyperintense, sparing the periphery and corticospinal tracts   PD: hyperintense  FLAIR: hyperintense  DWI: hyperintense  ADC: signal low or signal loss  T1 C+ (Gd): usually there is no enhancement, but some authors reported that it may occur 5,6  PETAffected regions may demonstrate initial high uptake followed by subsequent low uptake with 18-FDG.Treatment and prognosisSome patients completely recover, but six month survival rate is only 5-10%.Differential diagnosisGeneral imaging differential considerations include: demyelination including multiple sclerosis (MS)  infarction from basilar perforators can be central, although usually, brainstem infarcts stop at the midline pontine neoplasms including astrocytomas: brainstem is asymmetrically expanded with mass effect upon adjacent cisterns. local vessels may also be displaced brainstem metastasis: usually enhances 
__label__Musculoskeletal __label__Spine Os odontoideum (plural: ossa odontoidea) is an anatomic variant of the odontoid process of C2 and needs to be differentiated from persistent ossiculum terminale and from a type 2 odontoid fracture. It can be associated with atlantoaxial instability. Although it was originally thought to be a congenital lesion due to a failure of the center of ossification of the dens to fuse with the body of C2, it may actually represent an unremembered and/or unrecognised fracture through the dens's growth plate before the age of 5 or 6. There may be associated instability and chronic symptoms 5.The level of mobility is below the transverse band of the cruciform ligament and therefore results in abnormal mobility of the dens with respect to C2.SubtypesAn os odontoideum can be divided into two main types 2: orthotopic: normal position with a wide gap between C2 and os odontoideum dystopic: displaced (dystopic os odontoideum has also been termed the "os avis" by some) 4  AssociationsOften discovered incidentally on its own.

Surgical options can include an anterior, posterior or combined approach. An anterior approach (e.g. plated multilevel anterior discectomy and fusion, anterior cervical corpectomy with fusion) may provide more direct decompression and best improve myelopathy, although may cause greater soft-tissue morbidity. Posterior approaches (e.g. laminectomy and fusion and laminoplasty) may be better tolerated in older patients 8.

It is present in ~1% of the population 5.  On this page:  Article: Clinical presentation Pathology Radiographic features Differential diagnosis Related articles References   Images: Cases and figures Imaging differential diagnosis   Clinical presentationThey usually are asymptomatic although they may eventually cause painful syndromes or degenerative changes in response to overuse and trauma.PathologyNormally, the secondary center of ossification of the distal tibia appears during the first year of life. It fuses with the shaft at ~15 years in females and ~17 years in males. The medial malleolus is generally an extension from the distal epiphysis and ossifies in the seventh year.An accessory bone is formed when the separate epiphysis of the medial malleolus fails to fuse with the distal tibia.Radiographic featuresPlain radiograph projects posteriorly, adjacent to the posterior colliculus typically measures more than 4 mm well-rounded 5  Differential diagnosis  malleolar fracture (when radiographs are taken following an injury to the ankle) 3, 4  ossicles related to the anterior colliculus (unfused medial malleolus ossification center) present in ~2% of the population 5  differentiated from other ossicles in this region by its smaller size to os subtibiale, its rounded and well-defined shape, and its anterior position 1,5    post-traumatic ossification of the deltoid ligament complex 5  
__label__Musculoskeletal The os supranaviculare is an accessory ossicle located at the proximal dorsal aspect of the navicular bone or talonavicular joint. It is also known as Piries bone, talonavicular dorsale or (dorsal) talonavicular ossicle and is present in ~1% of the population. Differential diagnosisAn os supratalare is also anatomically seen in close proximity, sitting above the talar beak, but not at the superior margin of the navicular bone.
__label__Musculoskeletal An os supratalare is an accessory ossicle of the foot located at the superior aspect of the talar head or neck. It has a reported incidence of ~1% (range 0.2-2.4%) 1. It is almost always asymptomatic. Differential diagnosis  os supranaviculare is also anatomically seen in close proximity to the superior margin of the navicular and is often mistaken as os supratalare os talotibiale avulsion fracture

__label__Musculoskeletal Osteitis condensans ilii (also known as hyperostosis triangularis ilii, a term used in Germany or Osteopathia condensans ilii) is characterized by benign sclerosis of the ilium adjacent to the sacroiliac (SI) joint, typically bilateral and triangular in shape. On this page:  Article: Clinical presentation Pathology Radiographic features Treatment and prognosis Differential diagnosis References   Images:Cases and figures  Clinical presentationIt is usually asymptomatic but uncommonly may cause lower back pain, with a frequency of about 1-2.5% 4.PathologyThe underlying etiology is believed to be mechanical stress across the sacroiliac joint. Supporting this hypothesis, it is most often seen in women who have given birth; however, men and nulliparous women can be affected 2-4. Radiographic featuresPlain radiograph and CTSclerosis of the iliac side of the sacroiliac joint, typically bilateral, symmetrical, and triangular in shape 3,4. Lack of sacral involvement or joint space narrowing is considered diagnostic and may obviate the need for further imaging 3 (symmetric small focal sclerosis of the apposing sacrum is allowable though). Unilateral disease has been reported.Treatment and prognosisIt carries a benign prognosis and may even resolve spontaneously. Differential diagnosisThe main differential diagnosis is a sacroiliitis. With osteitis condensans ilii, the sacroiliac joint is normal, with no irregularity, erosions, or loss of joint space.
__label__Musculoskeletal Osteitis condensans of the clavicle is characterized by benign sclerosis of the inferomedial third of the clavicle. Its radiological appearance is homologous to that of the similarly-named osteitis condensans ilii, although no association has been reported. On this page:  Article: Clinical presentation Pathology  Radiographic features Treatment and prognosis History and etymology Differential diagnosis References   Clinical presentationIt usually affects women of childbearing age. It can present with pain on the abduction of the arm and localized swelling. Unlike osteitis condensans ilii, it is usually unilateral.PathologyThe syndrome seems to be a response to mechanical stress. Histology reveals thickened trabeculae, with both lamellar and woven components. Devitalised bone is present, suggesting remodelling. Periosteal reaction is often seen histologically. Radiographic featuresPlain radiograph and CTSclerosis of the inferior aspect of the medial third of the clavicle is seen, typically unilateral. It can sometimes be associated with a small osteophyte, but should never be associated with subchondral cysts, joint space narrowing or erosions.Treatment and prognosisIt carries a good prognosis. Pain can usually be managed with anti-inflammatory drugs.History and etymologyIt was initially described by Brower, Sweet and Keats in 1974 1.Differential diagnosisThe differentials are those of a sclerotic clavicle and include: osteoarthritis SAPHO Syndrome tumors or tumor-like conditions  Friedrich disease (avascular necrosis of the medial clavicle) sternoclavicular hyperostosis

Symphyseal cleft injections can be performed for diagnostic and therapeutic measures, gaining short-term symptom relief in small case series 6. Differential diagnosisThe main differential diagnoses are infection and hyperparathyroidism, the latter due to bone resorption. On MRI, the initial stages of osteitis pubis may mimic osteomyelitis 1.
__label__Musculoskeletal Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common form of arthritis, being widely prevalent with high morbidity and social cost.  On this page:  Article: Terminology Epidemiology Clinical presentation Pathology Radiographic features Treatment and prognosis History and etymology Related articles References   Images:Cases and figures  TerminologySome authors prefer the term osteoarthrosis instead of osteoarthritis as some authors do not believe in an inflammatory cause as might be suggested by the suffix "itis". The condition is sometimes called non-erosive osteoarthritis, to differentiate it from erosive osteoarthritis, although this is considered a form of osteoarthritis 6. EpidemiologyOsteoarthritis is common, affecting ~25% of adults 7. The prevalence increases with age. In the age group below 50 years men are more often affected, while in the older population the disease is more common in women. It is estimated that over 300 mln people in the world suffered from OA in 2017 13.Clinical presentationPatients present with decreased function from joint pain, instability and stiffness 7,10. The pain is typically worsened by activity and decreases at rest; in later disease stages it may become continuous 12. Many cases of radiological OA are asymptomatic and conversely clinically apparent OA may not manifest radiographic change 9,10. PathologyThe pathogenesis and pathophysiology of OA are yet to be fully understood 7. Despite emphasis being placed on articular cartilage degeneration, the remainder of the joint is involved including bone remodelling, osteophyte formation, ligamentous laxity, periarticular muscle weakness and synovitis 8,10.ClassificationOsteoarthritis can be 19:  primary (idiopathic) absence of an antecedent insult strong genetic component with the disease primarily affecting middle-aged women 5     secondary abnormal mechanical forces (e.g. occupational stress, obesity) previous joint injury  post-traumatic osteoarthritis accounts for ~12% of all OA 11  major cause in young adults 9    prior surgery crystal deposition (e.g. gout, CPPD) inflammatory arthritis (e.g. rheumatoid arthritis, seronegative spondyloarthritis) hemochromatosis     DistributionOA can affect both the axial and appendicular skeleton. The most common peripheral joints affected include ref: hands knee hip Risk factorsStrong risk factors for developing OA include 7,10: obesity increasing age female sex (particularly between the age 50 and 80) family history Radiographic featuresKey radiographic features are joint space narrowing (JSN), sclerosis, and osteophytosis. If all three of these findings are not present, another diagnosis should be considered. Recently, with increasing use of MRI in the assessment of OA, other findings have been studied, such as bone marrow lesions and synovitis.  joint space narrowing characteristically asymmetric least specific: present in many other pathological processes   sclerosis sclerotic changes occur at joint margins frequently seen unless severe osteoporosis is present   osteophytosis i.e. development of osteophytes  common DJD finding will also be diminished in the setting of osteoporosis some osteophytes carry eponymous names, e.g. Heberden nodes, Bouchard nodes    joint erosionsseveral joints may exhibit degenerative erosions 1: temporomandibular joint acromioclavicular joint sacroiliac joints symphysis pubis    subchondral cysts  also known as geodes  cystic formations that occur around joints in a variety of disorders, including, rheumatoid arthritis, calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate crystal deposition disease (CPPD) and avascular necrosis    bone marrow lesions (BML) 14,16 visible on MRI as bone marrow edema-like lesions, often adjacent to areas of cartilage damage - likely representing early OA changes have been shown to correlate with joint pain and progression of cartilage loss  may progress to subchondral cysts    synovitis a non-specific finding, present also in other diseases, including inflammatory and infectious conditions  present in up to 50% of the patients with OA 14  according to some authors it may be correlated with pain, disease severity and progression 14,15    Plain radiographIt is most commonly used modality due to its availability and low cost. It can detect bony features of OA, such as joint space loss, subchondral cysts and sclerosis, and osteophytes. It is, however, relatively insensitive to early disease changes. Other limitations are a lack of assessment of soft-tissue structures and low intrareader reliability 17.Scoring systems used to assess the severity of OA on radiographs include 17,18: Kellgren and Lawrence classification Osteoarthritis Research Society International (OARSI) atlas CTCT has excellent accuracy in assessing bony OA changes. It is especially useful in the assessment of the facet joints. In order to reliably assess the articular cartilage, an arthro-CT must be performed.UltrasoundUltrasound is not routinely used in OA. The assessment of the bony structure and deep joint structures using this modality is impossible. However, it is useful in detecting joint effusion, synovitis and osteophytes. It can also act as guidance in joint interventions.MRIMRI can very accurately assess both bones and soft-tissue joint structures. It can detect bone marrow changes and cartilage loss, both of which are early OA changes and are not visible on radiographs. On conventional MR, articular cartilage is best assessed using fluid-sensitive sequences with fat suppression; with the advent of new methods of cartilage quantification and composition assessment - currently used in research - the sensitivity is further increased. Contrast administration enhances the visualization of synovitis.Several scoring systems using MRI assessment of OA of the knee have been proposed 14: Whole-Organ Magnetic Resonance Imaging Score Knee Osteoarthritis Scoring System Boston Leeds Osteoarthritis Knee Score Nuclear medicineWhile not routinely used in clinical practice, nuclear medicine studies can provide information about multiple joints in one examination. The changes in the joints with OA show increased radiotracer uptake due to reactive bone turnover. The potential disadvantage of a poor anatomical resolution can be solved by using hybrid imaging 14.Nuclear medicine examination used in the assessment of OA are: scintigraphy with 99mTc-hydroxymethane diphosphonate (HDP) PET with 18FDG or 18F Treatment and prognosisThere is no effective treatment to slow or reverse the changes of osteoarthritis 7. The mainstays of treatment include exercise, walking aids, bracing, and analgesia (including intra-articular steroid injections) 8. Arthroplasty can result in improved function and reduced pain 10.History and etymologyThe term "osteoarthritis" was introduced as a synonym for rheumatoid arthritis by John K. Spender in 1886, however, it was not until 1907 that Archibald E. Garrod applied the term to the condition that is now considered to be osteoarthritis 19. 
__label__Musculoskeletal This is a basic article for medical students and other non-radiologistsOsteoarthritis is a destructive joint pathology that results from longstanding, repetitive trauma. It is most common in the small joints in the hand and weightbearing joints (knee and hip) and tends to be symmetrical.  On this page:  Article: Terminology Background Clinical features Radiographic features Related articles References   Images: Cases and figures Imaging differential diagnosis   TerminologyOsteoarthritis (OA) is a term commonly used in clinical practice and by the public. This common use refers to secondary osteoarthritis. There is also a hereditary form called primary osteoarthritis that occurs primarily in middle-aged women.BackgroundPathophysiologySecondary osteoarthritis is caused when repeated microtrauma to the joint surface over many years results in thinning of the cartilage and focal reduction in periarticular bone density. These changes result in relative weakness of the bone and overlying cartilage at weight-bearing joints.Over time, this repeated microtrauma leads to progressive injury and eventually, narrowing of the joint spaces and destruction of the joint surfaces.EtiologyA number of risk factors have been found that predispose individuals to the development of OA. These include obesity and metabolic disease, smoking, bone density, and genetic factors 2.EpidemiologySecondary osteoarthritis is a relatively common condition and tends to occur in the older population. Women are more commonly affected than men (13% vs 10% 1). Reported incidence is different for hand, knee and hip involvement and varies from country to country 2. The incidence of joint involvement is greatest in the hand, followed by the knee and then the hip.Clinical featuresPresentationPatients with hip and knee osteoarthritis present with pain and stiffness. They may also have a reduction in range of movement and reduced exercise tolerance.DiagnosisFollowing history taking and examination, plain x-rays are usually all that is required to confirm the diagnosis and make an assessment of severity.Radiographic featuresX-rayX-rays demonstrate a number of findings in osteoarthritis although they are not always seen and may occur in a variable manner from individual to individual:  joint space narrowing: reflects the loss of cartilage  sclerosis: present in almost all cases of OA  osteophytes: new bone formation around the joint (see osteophytes)  subchondral lucency: focal loss of bone density

This article is focused on primary (idiopathic) osteoarthritis.  On this page:  Article: Terminology Epidemiology Pathology Radiographics features Practical points Related articles References   Images:Cases and figures  TerminologyThe European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) uses the following terms 5: nodal OA: interphalangeal joint OA with Herbeden and/or Boucard nodes non-nodal OA: interphalangeal joint OA without Herbeden and/or Boucard nodes thumb base OA: first carpometacarpal joint OA +/ scaphotrapeziotrapezoidal (STT) joint OA   erosive OA: considered a subset of hand OA EpidemiologyHand osteoarthritis is highly prevalent with women over the age of 50 most commonly affected. The prevalence on hand radiographs is estimated at ~50% (range 27-80%), although many of these may be asymptomatic with prevalence rates of symptomatic hand OA reported at ~15% (range 6-26%) with increased prevalence in older age groups 1,4.Risk factorsMajor risk factors hand osteoarthritis includes 1,5: age >40 years female sex positive family history occupation (e.g. cotton picking, heavy manual labor, repetitive hand use) obesity prior joint injury PathologyDistributionThe sites of symptomatic hand OA (from most to least common) are 1,2,5: distal interphalangeal joints first carpometacarpal joint (thumb base) proximal interphalangeal joints metacarpophalangeal joints Classification Kellgren and Lawrence classification 2 Radiographics featuresFor a general discussion, please refer to the main article: Osteoarthritis. However, the joint space narrowing in hand OA may be symmetric compared with other joints where it is typically asymmetric 7.Plain radiographs are considered the gold standard for imaging hand OA 5. Radiologically, OA of the hand is typically symmetrical and can be grouped in a variety of ways 1,3: clustering by row (more common for finger OA) clustering by ray (more common for thumb OA, where it may be isolated) Osteophytes that develop in hand OA have eponymous names:  Heberden nodes affect the DIP joint  Bouchard nodes affect the PIP joint Practical pointssymptomatic hand OA more commonly occurs when symmetrical and grouped by row rather than by ray 6 
__label__Musculoskeletal Osteoarthritis of the hip can be graded according to the severity on imaging.ClassificationPlain radiograph  grade 0: normal  grade 1: possible joint space narrowing and subtle osteophytes   grade 2: definite joint space narrowing, defined osteophytes and some sclerosis, especially in the acetabular region  grade 3: marked joint space narrowing, small osteophytes, some sclerosis and cyst formation and deformity of femoral head and acetabulum  grade 4: gross loss of joint space with above features plus large osteophytes and increased deformity of the femoral head and acetabulum  MRI  grade 0: normal  grade 1: inhomogeneous high signal intensity in cartilage (T2WI)  grade 2: inhomogeneity with areas of high signal intensity in articular cartilage (T2WI); indistinct trabeculae or signal intensity loss in femoral head and neck (T1WI)  grade 3: criteria of grade 1 and 2 plus indistinct zone between femoral head and acetabulum; subchondral signal loss due to bone sclerosis  grade 4: above criteria plus femoral head deformity

__label__Head __label__& __label__Neck Osteoarthritis of the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) is the end point of long-standing TMJ dysfunction. It is a common finding incidentally on a base of skull imaging, and it should be remembered that TMJ pain does not correlate well with osteoarthritic changes. Indeed pain from TMJ dysfunction is often self-limiting.Radiographic features Changes are usually more evident on the condylar side of the joint: flattening: common (in one series 27%) osteophytes: common (27%) erosions: 13% sclerosis: less common (9%) subchondral cysts Treatment and prognosisSymptomatic treatment usually involves the intra-articular injection of hyaluronic acid, corticosteroids, diclofenac, or glucosamine 4. Injection can be preceded by arthrocentesis (joint lavage). Definitive treatment consists of prosthetic replacement of parts of the joint 5.
__label__Musculoskeletal __label__Spine Osteoarthritis of the vertebral column, also known as spondylosis deformans, is common and usually merely referred to as spinal "degenerative change". Complications such as spinal stenosis are important to recognize. Radiographic featuresThe hallmark of osteoarthritis in the spine, as is the case elsewhere, is the presence of osteophytes. Traction osteophytes project obliquely or horizontally from the endplates, which is helpful in distinguishing them from syndesmophytes of ankylosing spondylitis. 
__label__Musculoskeletal Osteoblastomas are rare bone-forming tumors that may be locally aggressive. They are larger (>1.5-2 cm) and tend to affect the axial skeleton more often than their histologic relative, osteoid osteoma. On this page:  Article: Epidemiology Clinical presentation Pathology Radiographic features Treatment and prognosis Differential diagnosis Related articles References   Images:Cases and figures  EpidemiologyThey account for 1-3% of all primary bone tumors 2,3. Patients typically present around the second to third decades of life. There is a recognized male predilection with a male to female ratio of approximately 2.5:1.Clinical presentationWith spinal lesions, painful scoliosis is a common presenting symptom. Otherwise, it presents with an insidious onset of dull pain, worse at night, with minimal response to salicylates (only 7% of patients respond, unlike osteoid osteoma). The area will characteristically be swollen and tender with a decreased range of motion.PathologyOsteoblastoma is histologically similar to an osteoid osteoma but they are larger. They are bone- and osteoid-forming and is comprised of osteoblasts. There is high associated vascularity.Location spinal column: ~40% (range 32-46% 2); often involves the posterior column cervical spine: 9-39% of all spinal lesions 2   sacrum: 17% of all spinal lesions 3    usually located in the metaphysis and distal diaphysis of the long bones Variants aggressive (malignant) osteoblastoma: has a high of number epithelioid osteoblasts with nuclear atypiaRadiographic featuresOsteoblastomas can have a wide range of radiographic patterns. Lesions are typically larger than 1.5-2 cm in size although smaller lesions may occur 4,5. Plain radiograph lesions are predominantly lytic, with a rim of reactive sclerosis tend to be expansive internal calcification may sometimes be present an associated soft tissue mass may also be present demonstrate a rapid increase in size with associated cortical expansion in the vast majority of patients, sometimes with cortical destruction there may be surrounding sclerosis or periostitis in up to 50% there may be a secondary aneurysmal bone cyst in 20% CT  similar to the radiograph, lesions are often demonstrated as predominantly lytic  internal matrix mineralization is better appreciated on CT MRIMRI features tend to be non-specific and often overestimate the lesion 9:  T1: typically hypo to isointense on T1 with areas of decreased intensity that correspond to foci of calcification  T2: typically isointense to hypointense on T2 with foci of decreased intensity corresponding to the foci of calcificationa high signal may be seen in surrounding bone marrow and soft tissues due to edema "flare phenomenon" 11    C+ (Gd): this is a highly vascular tumor and therefore typically avidly enhances, with associated enhancement of the surrounding soft tissues 9  Nuclear medicine Tc-99m MDP or HMDL: often shows intense uptake although this is non-specific and is typical in all lesions exhibiting increased bone turnoverTreatment and prognosisRadical surgical excision is often the treatment of choice. Pre-operative embolization is commonly carried out to reduce bleeding risk although surgery needs to be performed at a very short time interval in order to avoid reconstitution of collateral blood supply. Percutaneous ablation is an emerging modality for treatment of these lesions (as well as osteoid osteoma) 10.ComplicationsLesions are prone to extensive intraoperative bleeding due to intrinsic vascularity.Differential diagnosis osteoid osteoma: <1.5-2 cm
__label__Musculoskeletal __label__Trauma Osteochondral defects (OCD) are focal areas of articular damage with cartilage damage and injury of the adjacent subchondral bone.  On this page:  Article: Terminology Pathology Radiographic features Treatment and prognosis Related articles References   Images:Cases and figures  TerminologyOsteochondral defect is a broad term that describes the morphological change of a localized gap in the articular cartilage and subchondral bone 5. It is often used synonymously with osteochondral injury/defect and in the pediatric population.  It is synonymous with osteochondral lesion (OCL).Please note that OCD is a commonly used abbreviation for both osteochondral defect and osteochondritis dissecans, two closely related conditions.PathologyEtiology  osteochondritis dissecans: thought to be due to repeated microtrauma subchondral collapse secondary to avascular necrosis or subchondral insufficiency fracture  osteochondral impaction fracture postsurgical (e.g. following anterior cruciate ligament repair) LocationThe recognized sites of osteochondral defects are: femoral condyle (most common in the lateral aspect of the medial femoral condyle) humeral head talus capitellum of the humerus StagingOsteochondral injuries are graded according to the stability and location of the fragment and presence of secondary degenerative changes (see: osteochondral injury staging).Radiographic featuresPlain radiograph and CTBoth x-rays and CT are able to detect displaced defects with ease. However, they are insensitive to grading lower stage lesions and are inadequate in predicting stability.MRIMRI is the modality of choice, with high sensitivity and specificity for the detection of separation of the osteochondral fragment (see: osteochondral injury staging and osteochondritis dissecans surgical staging). This is essential in determining management.  T1the signal is variable with intermediate to low signal adjacent to fragment and variable fragment signal   T2 high signal line (rim sign) demarcating fragment from bone usually indicates an unstable lesion, however, false positives can result from edema low signal loose bodies, outlined by high signal fluid donor defect filled with high signal fluid high signal subchondral cysts   Treatment and prognosisTreatment depends on the location and size of the defect as well as the presence of secondary degenerative changes. When the latter is present, then joint replacement is often the only feasible treatment.At earlier stages (stage 1 to 4), a number of options exist including: osteochondral autograft (same patient) osteochondral allografts (cadaveric donor) subchondral bone drilling chondral shaving and abrasion

__label__Musculoskeletal __label__Paediatrics Osteochondritis dissecans (OCD) is the end result of the aseptic separation of an osteochondral fragment with the gradual fragmentation of the articular surface and results in an osteochondral defect. It is often associated with intraarticular loose bodies. On this page:  Article: Epidemiology Clinical presentation Pathology Radiographic features Complications Treatment and prognosis History and etymology Differential diagnosis  See also References   Images:Cases and figures  EpidemiologyOnset is between childhood and middle age, with the majority of patients being between 10 and 40 years of age, with approximately a 2:1 male to female ratio 3.Risk factors repetitive throwing / valgus stress and gymnastics / weight bearing on upper extremityvalgus stress / compressive force on the vulnerable  chondroepiphysis of the radiocapitellar joint in skeletally immature patients is supported as the etiology for OCD of the capitellum 8   ankle sprain/instabilityIn the talus, 96% of lateral lesions and 62% of medial lesions were associated with direct trauma 9   competitive athletics 10  family history: epiphyseal dysplasia has been postulated as a subset of OCD 11  Clinical presentationSymptoms are variable and range from asymptomatic to significant pain and locking (suggesting loose body formation). Joint effusions and synovitis are often present.PathologyThe exact etiology is uncertain, with the majority of cases thought to be the result of trauma 4. In up to 40% of cases, patients give a history of trauma as the inciting event 3. Other postulated causes include 4: avascular necrosis (AVN) fat emboli microtrauma familial dysplasia LocationMany joints can be affected, but typical locations include: knee: femoral condyles are most common site accounting for ~95% of all cases: see osteochondritis dissecans of the knee  ankle (talus): see osteochondritis dissecans of the ankle  elbow (capitellum): see osteochondritis dissecans of the elbow  shoulder (glenoid) 7  StagingSee osteochondral injury staging and osteochondritis dissecans surgical staging.Radiographic featuresPlain radiographPlain radiographs should be the first step in the evaluation of knee pain, however, unless advanced changes are present and/or a meticulous technique employed, early findings of osteochondritis dissecans may be occult. The intercondylar "notch" view is very helpful.Early findings include subtle flattening or indistinct radiolucency about the cortical surface. As the process progresses, more pronounced contour abnormalities, fragmentation and density changes (both lucency and sclerosis) become evident. If an osteochondral fragment becomes unstable and displaced, then donor site and intra-articular fragment may be seen.CTCT has the advantage of sectional imaging through the joint and multiplanar reformats. Findings are similar to those seen on plain radiographs.MRIMRI is the test of choice, with high sensitivity (92%) and specificity (90%) 4 in the detection of separation of the osteochondral fragment. This is essential in determining management.

Numerous surgical approaches have been tried, including drilling, bone grafting, replacement of bone fragment and pinning 5.When surgery is performed, the results in most cases are only "fair". ~50% (range 35-70%) of patients achieve a "good to excellent" clinical outcome 3 but even in these cases, the majority develop osteoarthritis.History and etymologyIt was first described by the German surgeon Franz Konig in 1888.Differential diagnosis  normal irregular distal femoral epiphyseal ossification avascular necrosis osteochondral impaction fracture  stress/insufficiency fracture  See alsodifferential diagnosis of erosive arthritis

__label__Musculoskeletal The term osteochondrodysplasia is usually used synonymously with skeletal dysplasia, and merely means a dysplasia involving bone and cartilage.These conditions typically affect collagen metabolism, and often found as part of a skeletal dysplasia syndrome (e.g. Cantu sydnrome)1-3. As such the term osteochondrodysplasia should not be used as a specific diagnosis. 
__label__Musculoskeletal Osteochondromas are a relatively common imaging finding, accounting for 10-15% of all bone tumors and approximately 35% of all benign bone tumors. Although usually thought of as a benign bone tumor, they may be thought of as a developmental anomaly. They are frequently asymptomatic and have very low malignant potential if sporadic and solitary. On this page:  Article: Epidemiology Clinical presentation Pathology Radiographic features Treatment and prognosis Differential diagnosis Related articles References   Images: Cases and figures Imaging differential diagnosis   EpidemiologyOsteochondromas develop during childhood (period of most rapid skeletal growth), but once formed remain for the rest of the individual's life. They can present at any age and are most frequently found incidentally. They are usually sporadic, but can be part of:  hereditary multiple exostoses (HME): also known as diaphyseal aclasis   Trevor disease: also known as dysplasia epiphysealis hemimelica  Malignant transformation occurs in the cartilage cap, and is uncommon in sporadic solitary osteochondromas (~1%), whereas in the setting of hereditary multiple exostoses the rate is much higher (5-25%) 5.Clinical presentationSymptomatic presentation is either due to mechanical effects of the lesion, fracture, or malignant transformation. Mechanical symptoms include: impingement upon nearby structures: nerve compression vascular compression reactive myositis   palpable lump bursal formation and bursitis  Fractures occur typically through the neck of pedunculated lesions. Ongoing growth and or pain after skeletal maturity has been reached is suspicious for malignant degeneration. PathologyOsteochondromas are considered a chondroid neoplasm and are primarily a part of the growth plate which separates and continues growing independently, without an associated epiphysis, usually away from the nearby joint. The medullary cavity is continuous with the parent bone, and hyaline cartilage caps them. Osteochondromas can be congenital or occur as a result of previous trauma to the growth plate, including previous irradiation 3,4.LocationThey most commonly arise from the appendicular skeleton, especially around the knee 3: lower limb: 50% of all cases 3 femur (especially distal): most common: 30% tibia (especially proximal): 15-20% less common locations: feet, pelvis   upper limb humerus: 10-20% less common locations: hands, scapula   spine: the posterior elements of the spine are an uncommon but not rare site for these tumors Radiographic featuresPlain radiographAn osteochondroma can be either sessile or pedunculated and is seen in the metaphyseal region typically projecting away from the epiphysis. There is often associated broadening of the metaphysis from which it arises. The cartilage cap is variable in appearance. It may be thin and difficult to identify, or thick with rings and arcs calcification and irregular subchondral bone. New cortical irregularity or continued growth after skeletal maturity has been reached, as well as frankly aggressive features (e.g. bony destruction, large soft tissue component, metastases) are all worrying for malignant transformation. CTCT demonstrates the same findings as on radiograph but is better able to demonstrate medullary continuity and the cartilage cap. UltrasoundUltrasound is able to demonstrate the cartilage cap very accurately as a hypoechoic region bounded by bone on its deep surface and muscle/fat superficially.MRIMRI is the best imaging modality to assess cartilage thickness (and thus assessing for malignant transformation), the presence of edema in bone or adjacent soft tissues, and visualizing neurovascular structures in the vicinity.The cartilage cap of osteochondromas appears the same as cartilage elsewhere, with intermediate to low signal on T1 and high signal on T2 weighted images. A cartilage cap of over 1.5 cm in thickness is suspicious for malignant degeneration. With intravenous gadolinium administration, enhancement of benign lesions is normally seen in the tissue that covers the cartilaginous cap which is fibrovascular in nature, however, the cartilaginous cap itself should not enhance. Nuclear medicineDuring growth, osteochondromas demonstrate increased uptake on bone scans, but with time they become no more active than normal bone. Presence of increased activity in adulthood should raise the possibility of a complication (e.g. fracture, malignancy).Treatment and prognosisAs they represent normal growth of a growth plate in an abnormal direction, they often stop growing with the rest of the skeleton 3. In most instances, no treatment is required. The osteochondroma can be locally resected for cosmetic or mechanical reasons.If malignant transformation occurs (~1% in solitary osteochondromas and ~5-25% with hereditary multiple exostoses) then the resultant chondrosarcoma is usually of low grade (67-85% of cases), and surgery is usually curative (70-90%) 3,5. Limb-sparing wide local excision usually suffices. The features associated with sarcomatous transformation can be remembered by the mnemonic GLAD PAST 1:  growth after skeletal maturity  lucency (new)  additional scintigraphic activity  destruction (cortical)  pain after puberty  and  soft tissue mass  thickened cartilage cap greater than 1.5cm Local recurrence is seen in both benign and malignant lesions, due to spillage of cartilage cells into the resection bed. Rates are estimated at 2% and up to 15% respectively 3. Differential diagnosisImaging differential considerations include: hands: bizarre parosteal osteochondromatous proliferation (BPOP): arises from the bone cortex and lacks medullary continuity humerus: supracondylar spur: projects towards the elbow joint malunited fracture

__label__Musculoskeletal __label__Paediatrics Osteofibrous dysplasia is a benign fibro-osseous cortical lesion that occurs almost exclusively in the tibia and fibula. It is most commonly seen in the mid-diaphysis of the tibia. Some consider it synonymous with ossifying fibroma because of histological similarities, but it is generally considered a separate entity due to different presentation and treatment. On this page:  Article: Terminology Epidemiology Clinical presentation Pathology Radiographic features Treatment and prognosis Differential diagnosis References   Images:Cases and figures  TerminologyA commonly used synonym is ossifying fibroma of the long bones.Epidemiology most common in younger patients, e.g. ~ 10 years of ageless commonly reported in older patients, up to 63 years of age 3   slight male predilection (3:2 ratio 3) Clinical presentationMost patients present with pain and swelling, and patients may present secondary to a pathological fracture.PathologyOsteofibrous dysplasia is considered as a benign, non-neoplastic condition. Some consider it as part of a spectrum of osteofibrous dysplasia-like adamantinoma and adamantinoma.Microscopic appearanceHistology shows trabecular bone woven within fibrous stroma with osteoblastic rimming and mature lamellar bone.It is closely related to fibrous dysplasia (fibrous dysplasia is predominantly medullary), but the zonal phenomenon and osteoblastic rimming of bony trabeculae are absent in fibrous dysplasia.Osteofibrous dysplasia and ossifying fibroma of the jaw have similar histological characteristics, but osteofibrous dysplasia shows cytokeratin-positive cells, whereas ossifying fibroma of the jaw shows psammomatous calcification, which are exclusive features.Although adamantinoma can contain osteofibrous dysplasia-like components, nests or strands of an epithelioid cell are the differentiating feature between adamantinoma and osteofibrous dysplasia.Adamantinoma with scarce epithelioid component and mostly composed of osteofibrous dysplasia-like tissue are considered as osteofibrous dysplasia-like adamantinoma.Radiographic featuresOsteofibrous dysplasia is classically a lytic lesion centered in the tibial cortex, often with sclerotic margins. Because of its similarity to adamantinoma, a much more aggressive pathology, a primary issue is differentiating between the two.Due to intralesional heterogeneity, needle biopsy may result in diagnostic misclassification, particularly with underestimation of aggressive lesions. Thus, radiologic-pathologic correlation is important with benign or equivocal biopsy results 3.Osteofibrous dysplasia tends to be: smaller (mean 6-7 cm versus 10-17 cm for adamantinoma) with more distinct margins less likely to involve the medullary cavity Plain radiographPlain radiograph remains the initial and chief investigation. location: along long axis: mid-diaphysis, especially anteriorly along transverse axis: cortical with medullary encroachment   consistency lucent or ground-glass lobular-to-bubbly in appearance   margins narrow zone of transition sclerosis common   no nidus no aggressive periosteal reactionbenign-appearing periosteal reaction is non-specific, and can be seen in all lesions along the osteofibrous dysplasia/adamantinoma spectrum 3   +/- pseudotrabeculation and anterior bowing MRIMRI is helpful in evaluation of suspected osteofibrous dysplasia, particularly to evaluate the extent of intramedullary involvement.

__label__Musculoskeletal __label__Paediatrics Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) refers to a heterogeneous group of congenital, non-sex-linked, genetic disorders of collagen type I production, involving connective tissues and bones. The hallmark feature of osteogenesis imperfecta is osteoporosis and fragile bones that fracture easily, as well as, blue sclera, dental fragility and hearing loss. There is extreme variation in clinical symptoms based on genetic basis and subtypes. Osteogenesis imperfecta affects both bone quality and quantity (i.e. bone mass). On this page:  Article: Epidemiology Clinical presentation Pathology Radiographic features Treatment and prognosis Differential diagnosis References   Images:Cases and figures  EpidemiologyThe estimated incidence is approximately 1 in every 12,000-15,000 births 2. Osteogenesis imperfecta occurs with equal frequency among males and females and across races and ethnic groups. The lifespan varies with the type (see osteogenesis imperfecta classification).Clinical presentationThe clinical presentation of osteogenesis imperfecta is highly variable, ranging from a mild form with no deformity, normal stature and few fractures to a form that is lethal during the perinatal period. In general, four major clinical features characterize osteogenesis imperfecta 5: osteoporosis with abnormal bone fragility blue sclera dentinogenesis imperfecta hearing impairment Other features include ligamentous laxity and hypermobility of joints, short stature and easy bruising.PathologyA fundamental pathology in osteogenesis imperfecta is a disturbance in the synthesis of type I collagen, which is the predominant protein of the extracellular matrix of most tissues. In bone, this defect results in osteoporosis, thus increasing the tendency to fracture. Besides bone, type I collagen is also a major constituent of dentin, sclerae, ligaments, blood vessels and skin 4.GeneticsOsteogenesis Imperfecta is the result of a mutation in one of the two genes that carry instructions for making type 1 collagen. Mutations in the COL1A1 and COL1A2 genes, which encode the α2 and α2 polypeptide chains 7, are responsible for more >90% of all cases.Depending on the type, the inheritance of the disorder can be autosomal dominant (>95%), autosomal recessive (<10%) or by sporadic mutation 2,6,7.ClassificationThe first classification of osteogenesis imperfecta was by Looser, in 1906 who divided the condition into two forms, osteogenesis imperfecta congenita (also known as Vrolik disease) and osteogenesis imperfecta tarda (also known as Ekman-Lobstein disease).Since then newer classification systems were based on work by Sillence and colleagues in 1979, have taken into account the phenotypic features and the mode of inheritance. This has since been revised and up to eight forms of osteogenesis imperfecta have been identified.Three main types are easily distinguished mild: type I perinatal lethal: type II progressive deforming: type III Types IV to VIII are variable in severity and uncommon (see osteogenesis imperfecta classification for further detail).Associationscongenital cataractsRadiographic featuresPlain radiographThis is the preferred initial examination. head, neck and spine basilar invagination wormian bones kyphoscoliosis vertebral compression fractures codfish vertebrae platyspondyly   chest pectus excavatum or carinatum   pelvis protrusio acetabuli coxa vara   general severe osteoporosis  deformed, gracile (over-tubulated) bones  cortical thinning hyperplastic callus formation  popcorn calcification: the metaphyses and epiphyses exhibit numerous scalloped radiolucent areas with sclerotic margins 1   zebra stripe sign: cyclic bisphosphonate treatment produces sclerotic growth recovery lines in the long bones formation of pseudarthrosis at sites of healing fractures   Prenatal ultrasoundThe prenatal sonographic features are often useful in type II (perinatal) and type III forms. may show decreased calvarial ossification this may result in visualization of fetal brain detail the skull may deform/compress with transducer pressure   may show evidence of fractures  long bones may appear shortened and/or angulated as a result there may be a sonographic gap along the length of a long bone  ribs may have a beaded appearance   there may be the presence of polyhydramnios 8  CTWhile showing most of the plain film features, CT may also better demonstrate: wormian bones basilar invagination  otosclerosis 3  MRIcan be used to assess the extent of basilar invaginationTreatment and prognosisPrognosis is very variable depending on type ranging from being uniformly lethal from type II to a slight reduction in life expectancy for type I.Management options for non-lethal types include: surgical correction of deformities and the prevention of fractures intramedullary rods with osteotomy are used to correct severe bowing of the long bones intramedullary rods are also recommended for children who repeatedly fracture long bones different types of rods (surgical nails) are available to address issues related to surgery, bone size, and the prospect for growth; the two major categories of rods are telescopic and non-telescopic 2    bisphosphonates growth hormone therapy Differential diagnosisGeneral considerations on pediatric plain films include: juvenile osteoporosis  Menkes syndrome (or kinky-hair syndrome) hypophosphatasia osteopenia of prematurity suspected physical abuse (previously termed non-accidental injury, NAI) 
__label__Musculoskeletal __label__Paediatrics The several forms of osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) have been classified, representing wide variation in appearance and severity, and clinical features vary widely not only between types but within types.ClassificationOsteogenesis imperfecta was initially classified by type according to a scheme developed by David Sillence, Australian clinical geneticist, based mainly on family history, clinical presentation and radiologic findings. It has since been modified due to the advance in genetics, with the following classification described by Glorieux and Rauch. Further detail can be found on the Osteogenesis Imperfecta Foundation website 1,2,4.Type I - mildType I is the commonest form (accounting for up to 50% of all cases) and is fortunately also the mildest form. It demonstrates autosomal dominant inheritance. Clinical features include: general bone fragility and predisposition to fracture stature is normal or near-normal loose joints and muscle weakness bone deformity absent or minimal head and neck features sclera often have a blue, purple, or grey tint brittle teeth (dentinogenesis imperfecta) differentiates between the two subtypes IA (without) and IB (with)  predisposed to hearing loss   Type II - perinatal lethalType II is the most severe form and is lethal at or shortly after birth mostly due to multiple rib fractures and pulmonary hypoplasia. It results from new dominant mutations to type 1 collagen genes. Clinical features include: numerous fractures and severe bone deformity IUGR wormian bones Type III - progressive deformingOI Type III is the most severe type among children who survive the neonatal period. The degree of bone fragility and the fracture rate vary widely. The majority of OI Type III cases result from dominant mutations in type I collagen genes. Clinical features include: at birth, infants generally have mildly shortened and bowed limbs, small chests, and a soft calvarium bones fracture easily; fractures are often present at birth, and x-rays may reveal healed fractures that occurred before birth short stature rotoscoliosis and vertebral compression fractures. the altered structure of the growth plates gives a popcorn-like appearance to the metaphyses and epiphyses. head and neck features sclera have a blue, purple, or grey tint triangular face hearing loss dentinogenesis imperfecta   Type IV - moderate-severePeople with OI Type IV are moderately affected. Type IV can range in severity from relatively few fractures, as in OI Type I, to a more severe form resembling OI Type III. Clinical features include: bones fracture easily, most before puberty shorter than average stature for age mild to moderate bone deformity head and neck features: sclerae are often light blue in infancy, but the color intensity varies - the sclerae may lighten to white later in childhood or early adulthood triangular face dentinogenesis imperfecta possible hearing loss possible   Types VSimilar to Type IV in appearance and symptoms of OI. Dominant inheritance pattern.Clinical features include: large hypertrophic calluses at the fracture or surgical procedure sites calcification of the interosseous membrane between the radius and ulna restricts forearm rotation and may cause dislocation of the radial head Types VIOI Type VI is extremely rare. It is moderate in severity and similar in appearance and symptoms to OI Type IV and is distinguished by a characteristic mineralization defect seen in biopsied bone. Mode of inheritance is unknown.Types VII and VIIITwo recessive types of OI, types VII and VIII, were recently identified.Recessively inherited OI has been discovered in people with lethal, severe, and moderate OI. There is no evidence of a recessive form of mild OI. Recessive inheritance probably accounts for fewer than 10 percent of OI cases. some cases of OI type VII resemble OI type IV in many aspects of appearance and symptoms other cases resemble OI type II, except that infants have white sclerae, small heads and round faces cases of OI type VIII are similar to OI types II or III in appearance and symptoms except for white sclerae Additional forms of OIThe following conditions are rare, but they feature fragile bones plus other significant symptoms.More detailed information on them can be found in Pediatric Bone: Biology and Diseases, Glorieux et al, 2003 3.  osteoporosis-pseudoglioma syndrome: severe form of OI that also causes blindness  Cole-Carpenter syndrome: OI with craniosynostosis and ocular proptosis.

__label__Musculoskeletal Osteoid is a protein mixture secreted by osteoblasts that forms the organic matrix of bone. Bone is formed when osteoid mineralizes.  Osteoid is important in several disease processes:  failure of osteoid to mineralize leads to osteomalacia in adults and rickets in children.  focal accumulations of osteoid can lead to Milkman's pseudofractures, which are suggestive of osteomalacia.  linear accumulations of osteoid may build perpendicular to the cortical margin and appear as Looser's zones or pseudofractures.     osteoid osteoma is composed of osteoid and woven bone, both of which can be seen as interconnected trabeculae, sheets, or isolated islands.

__label__Musculoskeletal __label__Paediatrics Osteoid osteomas are benign bone-forming tumors that typically occur in children (particularly adolescents). They have a characteristic lucent nidus less than 1.5 or 2 cm and surrounding osteosclerotic reaction, which classically causes night pain that is relieved by the use of salicylate analgesia, e.g. aspirin. On this page:  Article: Epidemiology Clinical presentation Pathology Radiographic features Treatment and prognosis Differential diagnosis Related articles References   Images: Cases and figures Imaging differential diagnosis   EpidemiologyOsteoid osteomas are usually found in children, adolescents, and young adults, between the ages of 10 and 35 years 2. They account for ~10% of all benign bone lesions and there is a male predilection (M:F 2-4:1) 2.Clinical presentationClassically patients present with nocturnal pain and is relieved by salicylates (e.g. aspirin).When in the spine they are a classic cause of painful scoliosis, concave on the side of lesion. This typical presentation is seen in over 75% of cases 2.Soft tissue swelling may occur (see case 4) and if close to a growth plate, accelerated growth may be evident 2, presumably related to hyperemia.When the lesion is intracapsular, the presentation is more atypical, and more likely mimics inflammatory arthropathy or synovitis. Joint effusion is often present 2,4.PathologyAn osteoid osteoma is composed of three concentric parts 1: nidus, representing the neoplastic process meshwork of dilated vessels, osteoblasts, osteoid, and woven bone may have a central region of mineralization 2    fibrovascular rim surrounding reactive sclerosis The nidus releases prostaglandins (via the enzymes cyclo-oxygenase-1 and cyclo-oxygenase-2) which in turn result in pain 2.LocationMost osteoid osteomas occur in long tubular bones of the limbs (especially the proximal femur), but any bone may be involved. long bones of the limbs: ~65-80% 1,2,7 femur most common (especially neck of femur) mid-tibial diaphysis common also   phalanges: ~20%  vertebrae: ~10%, predominantly posterior elements  lumbar: 59% 2  cervical: 27% thoracic: 12% sacrum: 2%   Furthermore, osteoid osteomas are usually cortical lesions but they can occur anywhere within the bone including medullary, subperiosteal (most commonly in the talus), and intracapsular 2.Radiographic featuresIt is important to remember that the sclerosis is reactive and does not represent the lesion itself. The nidus is usually <2 cm in diameter, and is typically ovoid. It may have a central region of mineralization 2.Plain radiographMay be normal or may show a solid periosteal reaction with cortical thickening. The nidus is sometimes visible as a well-circumscribed lucent region, occasionally with a central sclerotic dot.CTCT is excellent at characterizing the lesion and is the modality of choice. It typically shows a focally lucent nidus within surrounding sclerotic reactive bone. A central sclerotic dot may also be seen.Nuclear medicineSkeletal scintigraphy will show typical focal uptake and at times will show a double density sign (also known as the less catchy hotter spot within hot area sign) which if present is highly specific and helpful in distinguishing it from osteomyelitis. The central focus showing intense uptake within a surrounding lower - but nonetheless increased - uptake rim.UltrasoundOn ultrasound, focal cortical irregularity with adjacent hypoechoic synovitis may be present at the site of intra-articular lesions. The nidus can show hypoechogenicity with posterior acoustic enhancement. Ultrasound may be able to identify the nidus as a hypervascular nidus on Doppler examination 2.MRIAlthough MRI is sensitive, it is non-specific and is often unable to identify the nidus. The hyperemia and resultant bone marrow edema pattern may result in the scans being misinterpreted as representing aggressive pathology 2.The signal intensity of the nidus is variable on all sequences as is the degree of contrast enhancement 2.Treatment and prognosisThe lesion is benign and treatment has traditionally been with surgical resection. Historically, this has, on occasion, been difficult because of the inherent inability to locate the nidus during surgery 3. However, percutaneous radiofrequency ablation under CT guidance is being used with increasing frequency 5.There is growing evidence, that osteoid osteoma naturally resolves spontaneously with time and can be treated conservatively with NSAIDs in certain groups of patients 6. The average time to resolution is 33 months.Differential diagnosisGeneral imaging differential considerations include:  osteomyelitis (e.g. Brodie abscess): bone scan demonstrates central area of reduced uptake representing an avascular area of purulent material  osteoblastoma: >1.5-2 cm in size stress fracture cortical desmoid osteochondroma osteosarcoma  enostosis (bone island)  localized cortical thickening 8   intracortical hemangioma 8   reactive sclerosis around an osteolytic lesion 8

__label__Musculoskeletal Osteomesopyknosis is a genetic disorder transmitted as an autosomal dominant trait and is characterized by osteosclerosis of the axial spine, pelvis and proximal areas of the long bones. Its importance is due to recognizing this as a benign entity and not requiring more radiological work up.

__label__Musculoskeletal Osteomyelitis (plural: osteomyelitides) refers to inflammation of bone that is almost always due to infection, typically bacterial. This article primarily deals with pyogenic osteomyelitis, which may be acute or chronic. Other non-pyogenic causes of osteomyelitis are discussed separately: fungal osteomyelitis skeletal syphilis tuberculous osteomyelitis  On this page:  Article: Epidemiology Pathology Radiographic features Treatment and prognosis Differential diagnosis References   Images: Cases and figures Imaging differential diagnosis   EpidemiologyOsteomyelitis can occur at any age. In those without specific risk factors, it is particularly common between the ages of 2-12 years and is more common in males (M: F of 3:1) 6.PathologyIn most instances, osteomyelitis results from haematogenous spread, although direct extension from trauma and/or ulcers is relatively common (especially in the feet of diabetic patients).In the initial stages of infection, bacteria multiply, triggering a localized inflammatory reaction that results in localized cell death. With time, the infection becomes demarcated by a rim of granulation tissue and new bone deposition.Although no organisms are recovered in up to 50% of cases 1, when one is isolated, Staphylococcus aureus is by far the most common pathogen. Different organisms are more common in specific clinical scenarios 1,4:  Staphylococcus aureus: 80-90% of all infections  Escherichia coli: intravenous drug users (IVDU) and genitourinary tract infection  Pseudomonas spp.: IVDU and genitourinary tract infection  Klebsiella spp.: IVDU and genitourinary tract infection  Salmonella spp.: sickle cell disease   Haemophilus influenzae: neonates group B streptococci: neonates Other uncommon infective agents includefungi - fungal osteomyelitis LocationFrequency by location, in descending order 18:  lower limb (most common)  vertebrae: lumbar > thoracic > cervical radial styloid sacroiliac joint The location of osteomyelitis within a bone varies with age, on account of changes in vascularization of different parts of the bone 1,4: neonates: metaphysis and/or epiphysis children: metaphysis adults: epiphyses and subchondral regions Variantsemphysematous osteomyelitisRadiographic featuresIn some instances, radiographic features are specific to a region or a particular type of infection, for example: subperiosteal abscess Brodie abscess Pott puffy tumor sclerosing osteomyelitis of Garré Below are the general features of osteomyelitis.Plain radiographThe earliest changes are seen in adjacent soft tissues +/- muscle outlines with swelling and loss or blurring of normal fat planes. An effusion may be seen in an adjacent joint.In general, osteomyelitis must extend at least 1 cm and compromise 30 to 50% of bone mineral content to produce noticeable changes on plain radiographs. Early findings may be subtle, and changes may not be obvious until 5 to 7 days from onset in children and 10 to 14 days in adults. On radiographs taken after this time period, a number of changes may be noted: regional osteopenia  periosteal reaction/thickening (periostitis): variable; may appear aggressive, including the formation of a Codman's triangle 6  focal bony lysis or cortical loss  endosteal scalloping 8  loss of trabecular bone architecture new bone apposition eventual peripheral sclerosis In chronic or untreated cases, eventual formation of a sequestrum, involucrum and/or cloaca may be seen.CTCT is superior to both MRI and plain film in depicting the bony margins and identifying a sequestrum or involucrum. The CT features are otherwise similar to plain films. The overall sensitivity and specificity of CT is low, even in the setting of chronic osteomyelitis, and according to one study are 67% and 50%, respectively 17.Some limitations CT include 20: inability to confidently detect marrow edema; therefore, a normal CT does not exclude early osteomyelitis. image degradation by streak artifact when metallic implants are present MRIMRI is the most sensitive and specific and is able to identify soft-tissue/joint complications 5,14.Bone marrow edema is the earliest feature of acute osteomyelitis seen on MRI and can be detected as early as 1 to 2 days after the onset of infection 20.  T1 intermediate to low signal central component (fluid) surrounding bone marrow of lower signal than normal due to edema cortical bone destruction    T2 bone marrow edema central high signal (fluid)    T1 C+post contrast enhancement of bone marrow, abscess margins, periosteum and adjacent soft tissue collections  UltrasoundAlthough ultrasound excels as a fast and inexpensive examination of the soft tissues and can guide the drainage of soft tissue collections, it has little role in the direct assessment of osteomyelitis, as it is unable to visualize within the bone.It does, however, have a role in the assessment of soft tissues and joints adjacent to infected bone, as it can be used to visualize soft tissue abscesses, cellulitis, subperiosteal collections, and joint effusion.Ultrasound is also useful in assessing the extraosseous components of orthopedic instrumentation, as it is not affected by metal artifacts 3.Nuclear medicineA number of techniques may be employed to detect foci of osteomyelitis.These include 2:Bone scintigraphy (Tc-99m)Increased osteoblastic activity results in increased levels of radiotracer uptake in the surrounding bone, usually both on blood pool and delayed views. It is highly sensitive but not particularly specific.Indium-111 labeled WBC scintigraphyMay be useful in cases of: diabetic osteomyelitis, especially combined with Tc-99m-phosphonate imaging 2,7; however, MRI is now generally used in conjunction with plain films 14,15  orthopedic implants vertebral osteomyelitis (Ga-67 is best) 2  ulcers in bedridden patients with potential underlying osteomyelitis (In-111 with Tc-99m-phosphonate) Gallium-67 scintigraphy radiogallium attaches to transferrin, which leaks from the bloodstream into areas of inflammation, showing increased isotope uptake in infection, sterile inflammatory conditions, and malignancy imaging is usually performed 18 to 72 hours after injection and is often performed in conjunction with radionuclide bone imaging one difficulty with gallium is that it does not show bone detail particularly well and may not distinguish well between bone and nearby soft tissue inflammation gallium scans may reveal abnormal accumulation in patients who have active osteomyelitis when technetium scans reveal decreased activity (“cold” lesions) or perhaps normal activity gallium accumulation may correlate more closely with inflammatory activity in cases of osteomyelitis than does technetium uptake PET-CTPET-CT systems are relatively novel techniques that are being applied. FDG-PET may have the highest diagnostic accuracy for confirming or excluding chronic osteomyelitis in comparison with bone scintigraphy, MRI, or leukocyte scintigraphy. It is also considered superior to leukocyte scintigraphy in detecting chronic osteomyelitis in the axial skeleton 9.Treatment and prognosisTreatment of osteomyelitis is typically with intravenous antibiotics, often for extended periods. If a collection, sequestrum or involucrum is present, drainage and/or surgical debridement is often necessary. Amputation is performed after failure of medical therapy or when the infection is life-threatening.Complications include 1: sinus tract formation with occasional superimposed squamous cell carcinoma (Marjolin ulcer) secondary sarcoma (e.g. osteosarcoma): rare pathological fracture secondary amyloidosis Differential diagnosisGeneral imaging differential considerations include: Charcot joint metastases primary bone neoplasm Ewing sarcoma osteosarcoma lymphoma multiple myeloma   Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) 
__label__Musculoskeletal Osteonecrosis of the humeral head (ONHH), also known as Hass disease, is considered the second commonest location for osteonecrosis (following the hip).  On this page:  Article: Pathology Radiographic features See also References   Images:Cases and figures  PathologyIt generally develops in the subchondral region. In some patients, osteonecrosis can lead to collapse of the necrotic subchondral bone, development of an irregular joint surface, and subsequent joint degeneration. The general risk factors for osteonecrosis, in general, apply to humeral head osteonecrosis. Corticosteroid use has been recognized as a dominant causative association 4.Radiographic featuresWhile many of the general radiographic features for osteonecrosis may be present with ONHH, the presence of crescent sign can be the classic diagnostic feature in the correct clinical context 5. See alsoosteonecrosis

These conditions may share an underlying etiology (loss of function mutations in the LEMD3 gene) 5.Differential diagnosisThe differential diagnosis includes: normal variation in the prominence of periarticular vertical trabeculation adult osteopetrosis enchondromatosis osteopoikilosis 
__label__Musculoskeletal __label__Paediatrics __label__Central __label__Nervous __label__System Osteopathia striata with cranial sclerosis (OS-CS) is a clinically separate entity from osteopathia striata (Voorhoeve disease). Bony changes on their own are typically incidental and autosomal dominant, whereas OS-CS is a multisystem, X-linked dominant disorder. On this page:  Article: Epidemiology Clinical presentation Pathology      Radiographic features Treatment and prognosis  References   EpidemiologyOS-CS is extremely rare, with a prevalence of less than 0.1 in 1 million 1Clinical presentationOS-CS is a clinically heterogeneous condition, with the severity and the clinical presentation varying significantly between people, including individuals within the same family.Features are generally present at birth and include skeletal abnormalities marked by linear striations in the metaphyses of long bones and the pelvis, in combination with cranial sclerosis.Its associated pathologies range from mild skeletal changes to multisystem organ involvement, and include: developmental delay  hearing loss cranial nerve palsies due to narrowing of the nerve canals and foramina cataracts  macrocephaly and facial dysmorphysms including frontal bossing and hypertelorism cardiac defects including ventricular septal defect and aortic stenosis  anomalies of the extremities such as clubfoot  Pathology     GeneticsOS-CS is associated with mutations in the Wilms tumor gene on the X chromosome (WTX gene) and is inherited in an X-linked dominant manner, resulting in more severe disease and mortality in many affected males 2.AssociationsIn rare cases, OS-CS has been reported in association with Robin sequence, Hirschsprung disease and laryngotracheomalacia.Radiographic featuresThe radiological findings of cranial sclerosis, linear striations of the metaphyses of long bones and fan-like striations of the iliac crest are the hallmarks of OS-CS.Treatment and prognosisThere is no curative treatment for OS-CS. Management is generally multidisciplinary and aims to provide control of associated conditions and complications.Due to the large spectrum of associated features, the prognosis is dependent on the severity of the patient’s condition. As would be expected, those cases with severe manifestations and those associated with other pathologies such as Hirschprung disease or Robin sequence have a poor prognosis.
__label__Musculoskeletal Osteopenia refers to decreased bone mineral density. The change can be generalized or regional.TerminologyThe World Health Organization has formalized criteria for osteopenia, defined as a bone mineral density score between -1 and -2.5 standard deviations compared to a young adult reference mean (T-score) based on dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA).However, radiologists continue to use the term in a generic and qualitative manner to mean decreased bone density, without distinguishing osteopenia and osteoporosis. Because of this discrepancy, some have advocated avoiding the use of osteopenia on bone radiographs and CT in favor of "demineralization" 1.History and etymologyOsteopenia derives from the Greek words οστεον (osteon) meaning bone and πενια (penia) meaning poverty 2,3.NB: the spelling osteopaenia is erroneous and should never be used.
__label__Paediatrics __label__Musculoskeletal Osteopetrosis, also known as Albers-Schönberg disease or marble bone disease, is an uncommon hereditary disorder that results from defective osteoclasts. Bones become sclerotic and thick, but their abnormal structure actually causes them to be weak and brittle.There are two separate subtypes of osteopetrosis: infantile autosomal recessive osteopetrosis benign adult autosomal dominant osteopetrosis  On this page:  Article: Clinical presentation Pathology Radiographic features Treatment and prognosis History and etymology Differential diagnosis Related articles References   Images:Cases and figures  Clinical presentationPresentation, in the majority of cases, is with a fracture due to the weakened bones. Fractures are often transverse with multiple areas of callus formation and normal healing.Additionally, there is crowding of the marrow, so bone marrow function is affected resulting in myelophthisic anemia and extramedullary hematopoiesis with splenomegaly. This may terminate in acute leukemia.PathologyBoth forms are congenital abnormalities with localized chromosomal defects. These result in defective osteoclasts and overgrowth of bone. The bones become thick and sclerotic, but their increased thickness does not improve their strength. Instead, their disordered architecture results in weak and brittle bones. The osteoclasts lack carbonic anhydrase, which may play a role in the pathophysiology of the disease.Radiographic featuresThe features are dependent on the subtype of osteopetrosis and are detailed in the individual articles: infantile autosomal recessive osteopetrosis benign adult autosomal dominant osteopetrosis Treatment and prognosisTreatment is with bone marrow transplant and resultant normalization of bone production. Prognosis for the autosomal dominant adult subtype is good with a normal life expectancy. However, the autosomal recessive infantile subtype can result in stillbirth or death in infancy, with few patients living past middle age.History and etymologyThe term is derived from the Greek words 'osteo' meaning bone and 'petros' meaning stone. It was first described by German radiologist Heinrich Ernst Albers-Schönberg (1865-1921) in 1904 4,6. Interestingly Albers-Schonberg was the first Professor of Radiology in Germany - and perhaps globally - the Chair was bestowed on him by the University of Hamburg in 1919 6. Differential diagnosisGeneral imaging differential considerations include: heavy metal poisoning (e.g. lead) melorheostosis hypervitaminosis D pyknodysostosis  fibrous dysplasia of skull or face 
__label__Spine __label__Musculoskeletal Osteophytes are cartilage-capped bony proliferations (spurs) that most commonly develop at the margins of a synovial joint as a response to articular cartilage damage, as seen very commonly in degenerative joint disease.

__label__Paediatrics __label__Musculoskeletal __label__Oncology Osteopoikilosis is a sclerosing bony dysplasia characterized by multiple benign enostoses. It is a rare inherited benign condition incidentally found on skeletal x-rays. Its importance is predominantly in correct diagnosis so that it is not mistaken for pathology. On this page:  Article: Epidemiology Clinical presentation Pathology Radiographic features Differential diagnosis Related articles References   Images:Cases and figures  EpidemiologyThe bone islands of osteopoikilosis develop during childhood and do not regress and therefore are seen in all age groups. There is no gender predilection.Osteopoikilosis is inherited as an autosomal dominant disorder 1.Clinical presentationThe condition is asymptomatic and does not degenerate into malignancy. Bone strength is normal. PathologyHistologically, the bone islands found in osteopoikilosis and in sporadic enostoses are merely patches of dense cortical-like bone complete with haversian canals located within the spongiosa, often just deep to the cortex 7.A closely related entity is Buschke-Ollendorff syndrome.Osteopoikilosis is often found concurrently with osteopathia striata, and melorheostosis, and it is thought by some that they represent a spectrum of the same condition termed mixed sclerosing bone dysplasia. Indeed recent genetic evidence suggests that these conditions are related to a loss of function mutation of the LEMD3 gene 2.Other associations  Gunal-Seber-Basaran syndrome: osteopoikilosis with dacryocystitis   mixed sclerosing bone dysplasia: concurrent osteopoikilosis, osteopathia striata and melorheostosis 8. scleroderma tendency to keloid formation 7  Radiographic featuresPlain film and CTThe bone islands of osteopoikilosis are typically clustered around joints and align themselves parallel to surrounding trabeculae (thus predominantly longitudinal in the areas of well-defined linear trabeculae, while more-or-less spherical where the trabeculations are not as well organized linearly. An example of former is any of the five major groups of trabeculae seen in femur head and neck) 8. Most lesions are found in the appendicular skeleton and pelvis. The axial skeleton is largely spared. It is rare for the skull vault to be involved 6.The lesions vary in size, usually 5-10 mm, but ranging from only 1-2 mm up to 1-2 cm. MRIAppearances on MRI are the same as individual bone islands. Each lesion is small and dark on both T1 and T2 weighted images, as it is composed of mature dense bone 3.Bone scintigraphyA bone scan should not demonstrate any increase in uptake, useful if metastatic disease is considered in the differential.Osteopoikilosis is one of the skeletal “don’t touch” lesions.Differential diagnosisWhen seen throughout multiple bones with characteristic appearances, there is little differential. When only a few lesions are seen on an isolated film, the differential includes: incidental bone islands (enostoses)  other sclerosing bone dysplasias   sclerotic metastases (rarely involve epiphyses) osteosarcoma lymphoma  osteoid osteoma: only rarely multiple 4  chronic multifocal sclerosing osteomyelitis calcium and phosphate metabolism abnormalities Erdheim-Chester disease previous instrumentation/fractures/avascular necrosis  Paget disease 
__label__Musculoskeletal Osteoporosis is a metabolic skeletal disease defined as a reduction of bone mineral density below a defined lower limit of normal.The World Health Organization (WHO) defines osteoporosis as a T-score less than -2.5 SD. However, Z-scores are more reliable than T-scores (which are defined against adult white females) as they compare with normal people of same age and gender - see dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) for additional discussion of T and Z-scores. On this page:  Article: Clinical presentation Pathology Radiographic features Treatment and prognosis Related articles References   Images:Cases and figures  Clinical presentationOsteoporosis per se is asymptomatic and is most often diagnosed when individuals are evaluated on the basis of risk factors or following presentation with fragility fracture.PathologyOsteoporosis is essentially decreased bony tissue per unit volume of bone. There is no microstructural and biochemical change as occurs in osteomalacia or rickets. Hence the mineral-to-osteoid ratio is normal (cf. osteomalacia in which the mineral-to-osteoid ratio is decreased).Osteoporosis can be localized or diffuse and be divided into:  primary: no cause is identifiable  postmenopausal (type 1): occurs in 50-65-year-olds females; disproportionate loss of cancellous bone as compared to cortical bone resulting in more involvement of cancellous bone-rich areas, like vertebrae and ends of long bones  senile (type 2): occurs in the elderly; proportionate loss of cortical and cancellous bones affecting long bones idiopathic juvenile osteoporosis     secondary (type 3): occurs due to a range of causes including endocrine disease (e.g. Cushing syndrome, hyperthyroidism, hyperparathyroidism, diabetes mellitus) 7  chronic illness (e.g. COPD, chronic liver disease, multiple sclerosis, celiac disease) 7  inflammation medications (e.g. steroids, phenytoin)  thalassemia major 4   nutritional disturbances 6 (e.g. malnutrition, anorexia)  muscular dystrophies (e.g. Duchenne muscular dystrophy) - can be due to inherent derangement in calcium metabolism or due to steroid treatment 9.   There is a different list of secondary causes for juvenile osteoporosis with some overlap with adult causes. Radiographic featuresDecreased bone density can be appreciated by decreased cortical thickness and loss of bony trabeculae in the early stages in radiography. Bones like the vertebra, long bones (proximal femur), calcaneum and tubular bones are usually looked at for evidence of osteoporosis. Nevertheless, dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) is the gold standard of diagnosing osteoporosis 10. Plain radiograph not a sensitive modality, as more than 30-50% bone loss is required to appreciate decreased bone density on a radiograph vertebral osteoporosis manifests as pencilling of vertebrae loss of cortical bone and trabecular bone (ghost vertebra)  compression fractures and vertebra plans (Genant classification of vertebral fractures) prominent vertical (primary trabeculae) with thinning of horizontal/secondary trabeculae in vertebral bodies   loss of trabeculae in proximal femur area, which is explained by Singh's index (and can also be seen in the calcaneum) in tubular bones (especially metacarpals), there will be thinning of the cortexcortical thickness <25% of the whole thickness of metacarpal signifies osteoporosis (normally 25-33%)  Bone mineral density measurementBone mineral density (BMD) measurement is the method of estimation of calcium hydroxyapatite. Multiple x-ray based, gamma-ray based and ultrasonic methods are available: radiographic absorptiometry (RA) single photon and x-ray absorptiometry (SPA)  dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA)most commonly-used and most reliable   quantitative computed tomography can be used Based on DEXA BMD cann fall into three categories 10: normal (low risk of fracture) osteopenic (medium risk) osteoporotic (high risk) CTQuantitative CT can measure bone mineralization and BMD, which is usually done in the lumbar spine 10. UltrasoundQuantitative ultrasound of the calcaneal bone quality has recently emerged as a cost-efficient screening tool for osteoporosis 10. MRIBone marrow signal takes on a heterogeneous appearance with rounded focal fatty lesions replacing normal marrow with coalescence often occurring 5:  T1: heterogeneously hyperintense  T2: variable signal Osteoporotic wedge compression fractures will alter in signal characteristics depending on age.Treatment and prognosisAs osteoporosis decreases bone strength, patients are at an increased risk of fracture, often with minimal trauma, and commonly at the pelvis, hip and wrist.Oral bisphosphonates are the most commonly prescribed medications and are effective in reducing the risk of further osteoporotic fracture. There are a range of other medications that can also be used, including intravenous bisphosphonates, selective estrogen receptor modulators (e.g. raloxifene), denosumab, strontium ranelate, calcitonin, and parathyroid hormone-based treatments (e.g. teriparatide) 8.ComplicationsBisphosphonates and denosumab have been associated with rare, but serious, side effects including bisphosphonate-related atypical femoral fractures and bisphosphonate-related osteonecrosis of the jaw. 
__label__Musculoskeletal Osteoporosis circumscripta cranii (also known as osteolysis circumscripta) refers to discrete radiolucent regions of the skull on plain radiographs. They are often seen in context of the lytic (incipient-active) phase of Paget disease of the skull, but may be observed in other circumstances as well, e.g. hyperparathyroidism, leontiasis ossea 9.  On this page:  Article: Terminology Radiographic features Differential diagnosis Related articles References   Images: Cases and figures Imaging differential diagnosis   TerminologyOver time there has been some debate whether the term should be restricted to non-Pagetoid skull lesions or not 10-11. Just like contemporary literature 12-14 this article uses the term synonymously with the early phase of Paget disease of the skull.Radiographic featuresPlain radiographImaging appearances are those of: well-defined areas of radiolucency, often large most commonly located in frontal and occipital bones affecting both inner and outer calvarial tables, with changes in outer table usually more extensive In patients with simultaneous halisteretic metabolic bone changes, e.g. osteoporosis, identification of above mentioned changes may be challenging.CTBony changes are largely identical to those depicted in radiographic findings. Attenuation values of bone marrow space in affected areas are often those of macroscopic fat.As Paget disease most often presents as a continuum rather than distinct phase, sclerotic areas of the blastic (mixed) phase may more readily be detected. They usually present as cortical and trabecular thickening in a disorganized pattern without bony destruction. MRICortical changes are more readily appreciated on plain film or CT.Typical bone marrow changes in the incipient-active to early mixed phase show heterogenous signal on both T1 and T2-weighted imaging 3:  T1: decreased signal intensity, isointense to muscle, with interspersed foci of normal signal representing maintained yellow marrow (usable criterion to exclude malignant transformation)  T2: high intensity changes, heterogeneous and of "speckled" appearance, possibly presenting fibrovascular marrow changes  C+ (Gd): enhancement, typically of "speckled" appearance, may be present, indicating increased blood flow in the metabolically active sites Nuclear medicineSPECT/CTBone-seeking tracers (Tc99m conjugated bisphosphonates, typically MDP) show intense uptake in this early form of Paget disease. Additional sites (polyostotic disease) may be revealed in up to 30% of cases 6.In polyostotic disease discrepancy between morphological (CT) and pathophysiological changes (SPECT) especially in early and late stages should not lead to confusion and are well-described in literature 3,5.PET/CTNon-FDG PET/CT (F18-NaF)Owing to both higher bone uptake of this tracer combined with superior imaging quality (higher signal-to-noise ratio SNR due to faster blood clearance, higher spatial resolution of PET) compared to SPECT (see above,) intensity of uptake is even higher and polyostotic disease may be even more evident 5,7.FDG PET/CTEarly phase Paget disease of the skull usually lacks FDG-avidity 8. Encountering a lytic bone lesion (also resembling osteolysis circumscripta) in oncological patients may pose a differential diagnostic dilemma. Finding normal FDG-metabolism may aid in the diagnosis of benign Paget disease and obviate the need for biopsy 5.Differential diagnosisOn plain radiograph consider:  fibrous dysplasia (usually changes more prominent in outer table). osteolytic metastases

This disease is frequently mistaken for osteogenesis imperfecta.  On this page:  Article: Epidemiology Pathology Radiographic features References   EpidemiologyThis disease is encountered in approximately 1 in 2 million births. PathologyThis disorder is caused by a mutation in the gene encoding the low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 5 (LRP5). This gene plays an important role in bone remodelling 1. Radiographic featuresThe juvenile onset of severe osteoporosis is a constant finding, which is variably associated with one or multiple fractures and bone deformities. Fractures predominate in the spine and lower extremity. Wormian bones are frequently encountered. This combination of findings usually leads to the incorrect diagnosis of osteogenesis imperfecta 2.

However, they are largely unreported and are probably more common radiographically (present up to 14% of women older than 60 years in one study 1). Clinical presentationVertebral fractures present with pain and loss of mobility.Radiographic featuresVertebral fractures require treatment when they are symptomatic, i.e. with pain and loss of mobility. This defines the role of the radiologist in making an accurate diagnosis.The vertebral fracture should be diagnosed when there is a loss of height in the anterior, middle, or posterior dimension of the vertebral body that exceeds 20%. When in doubt, it is recommended that additional views or studies be advised for confirmation.Osteoporotic spine fractures can be graded based on vertebral height loss as: mild: up to 20-25% moderate: 25-40%  severe: >40% Also, see Genant classification of vertebral fractures.Acute vs chronicChronicity of the fracture indicates its temporal relationship with symptoms and hence is an important determination.On conventional imaging, acute fracture signs include cortical breaking or impaction of trabeculae; in the absence of these signs fractures are chronic.In uncertain cases, MRI signs of edema (acute) and presence of radiotracer uptake on bone scintigraphy (acute) help decide the age of the fracture.Osteoporotic vs pathological Discriminating between acute osteoporotic fracture and pathological fracture is sometimes challenging.The following features favor the diagnosis of a benign compression fracture: no bony destruction preserved normal fatty bone marrow T1WI signal low signal intensity band on T1WI and T2WI indicating a fracture line fluid sign retropulsion (not posterior bulging) of the posterosuperior cortex of the vertebral body no epidural mass multiple compression fractures Treatment and prognosisManagement options include: non-surgical observation/bracing medications: bisphosphonates for osteoporosis    surgicalvertebroplasty  
__label__Musculoskeletal Osteoradionecrosis (ORN) refers to a severe delayed radiation-induced injury and is characterized by bone tissue necrosis and failure in healing. There is some overlap with the term radiation osteitis. On this page:  Article: Pathology Radiographic features Treatment and prognosis Differential diagnosis See also References   Images:Cases and figures  PathologyMicrovascular damage is thought to result in altered blood supply to the bone.  This limits the ability of the tissues to repair normal wear and tear which, in turn, eventually results in the tissue breakdown seen on imaging.Usually, large radiation doses are required for osteoradionecrosis to occur (e.g. <3000-5000 cGy) 2.LocationWhile it can involve any bone within the irradiated field, there are specific sites in which osteoradionecrosis is more commonly seen. These include: mandible: mandibular osteoradionecrosis: this site is particularly prone due to its superficial location and high doses of radiation required to radically treat naso-oropharyngeal tumors chest wall-shoulder-humerus-scapula spine bony pelvis Radiographic featuresWhile there are general features, radiographic features can somewhat vary with the site of involvement.Plain radiographWith mandibular osteoradionecrosis, there can be ill-defined cortical destruction without sequestration. In osteoradionecrosis of the ribs, clavicle, scapula, and humerus, radiography may demonstrate 2 :  osteopenia: typically occurs after ~1 year after irradiation 4  disorganization and coarsening of trabecular architecture cortical irregularity heterogenous bone density CTWith mandibular osteoradionecrosis, CT may additionally show cortical interruptions and loss of spongiosa trabeculation 6. In other sites, CT may show the presence of subtle fractures, alterations in bone architecture and dystrophic soft-tissue calcification.MRIOn MRI, they can be the development of new heterogeneous signal within the marrow of an irradiated area (intermediate or low T1 signal, intermediate or high T2 signal). Osteoradionecrosis with or without osteomyelitis can be extremely difficult to differentiate from a recurrent tumor. Adjacent muscles may appear edematous and show intense enhancement, which can be difficult to differentiate from recurrent tumor if bone changes are not visible on CT 10. In osteoradionecrosis of the spine, hematopoietic cellular elements of the spinal marrow can also be replaced with fat, which then has 2  T1: high signal intensity  T2: intermediate signal intensity  Treatment and prognosisIt either stabilizes or gradually worsens, which then becomes notoriously difficult to manage.Differential diagnosisTo give a meaningful differentiation, location and imaging modality needs to be taken into account.

__label__Oncology __label__Musculoskeletal Osteosarcomas are malignant bone forming tumors. They are the second most common primary bone tumor after multiple myeloma, accounting for ~20% of all primary bone tumors. They can be classified into primary and secondary forms, as well as histologic types, of which conventional osteosarcoma is the most common. On this page:  Article: Epidemiology Clinical presentation Pathology Radiographic features Treatment and prognosis Differential diagnosis Practical points Related articles References   Images:Cases and figures  EpidemiologyPrimary osteosarcoma typically occurs in young patients (10-20 years) with 75% taking place before the age of 20 because the growth centers of the bone are more active during puberty/adolescence 3. There is a slight male predominance.Secondary osteosarcoma occurs in the elderly, usually secondary to malignant degeneration of Paget disease, extensive bone infarcts, post-radiotherapy for other conditions, osteochondroma, and osteoblastoma.Associations Paget disease of bone irradiation Rothmund-Thomson syndrome  fibrous dysplasia (more common in the polyostotic form)  Mazabraud syndrome (rare) Clinical presentationPatients often present with bone pain, occasionally accompanied by a soft-tissue mass or swelling. At times, the first symptoms are related to pathologic fracture.PathologyLocationPrimary osteosarcomas typically occur at the metadiaphysis of long bones in the appendicular skeleton, most commonly at the following sites: femur: ~40% (especially distal femur) tibia: ~16% (especially proximal tibia) humerus: ~15%  Other sites are less common: fibula innominate bone (i.e. os coxae) mandible (gnathic osteosarcoma) maxilla vertebrae Secondary tumors, on the other hand, have a much wider distribution, largely mirroring the combined incidence of their underlying conditions, and thus much have a higher incidence in flat bones, especially the pelvis (a favorite site of Paget disease).Osteosarcomas can be further categorized by anatomic relationship to the bone 3,8: intramedullary/central: ~80% surface: ~10-15%  intracortical osteosarcoma: rare  extraskeletal osteosarcoma: ~5% ClassificationThe WHO classification of bone tumors lists the histologic types of osteosarcoma, which can be further organized by the state of underlying bone and site of origin within the bone: primary osteosarcoma intramedullary/central conventional osteosarcoma: most common (75-80%) and discussed in this article low-grade central osteosarcoma telangiectatic osteosarcoma small cell osteosarcoma   surface parosteal osteosarcoma periosteal osteosarcoma high-grade surface osteosarcoma     secondary osteosarcoma Conventional osteosarcomas can be further divided by histological subtype: osteoblastic (most common) chondroblastic fibroblastic Macroscopic appearanceOsteosarcomas are bulky tumors where a heterogeneous cut surface demonstrates areas of hemorrhage, fibrosis and cystic degeneration. Their extension within the medullary cavity is often much more extensive than the bulky part of the tumor would suggest. Areas of bone formation are characteristic of osteosarcomas, with the degree of bone formation varying widely.Microscopic appearancePoorly formed trabecular bone is seen with (in the typical high-grade conventional subtype) cellular pleomorphism and mitoses. Variable amounts of fibrocystic and chondroblastic appearing cells may also be encountered. MarkersSerum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) may be raised (particularly with advanced disease).Radiographic featuresAlthough plain radiography can provide a lot of information, MRI is used for local staging by assessing intraosseous tumor extension (e.g. growth plate/epiphysis, skip lesions) and soft-tissue involvement. Chest CT and bone scanning have a role in distant staging.Plain radiographConventional radiography continues to play an important role in diagnosis. Typical appearances of conventional high-grade osteosarcoma include: medullary and cortical bone destruction wide zone of transition, permeative or moth-eaten appearance aggressive periosteal reaction  sunburst type Codman triangle  lamellated (onion skin) reaction: less frequently seen   soft-tissue mass tumor matrix ossification/calcification variable: reflects a combination of the amount of tumor bone production, calcified matrix, and osteoid ill-defined "fluffy" or "cloud-like" compared to the rings and arcs of chondroid lesions   CTThe role of CT is predominantly utilized in assisting biopsy and staging. CT adds little to plain radiography and MRI in the direct assessment of the tumor. The exception to this rule is predominantly lytic lesions in which small amounts of mineralized material may be inapparent on both plain film and MRI 4.MRIMRI is proving an essential tool to determine accurate local staging and assessment for limb-sparing resection, particularly for evaluation of intraosseous tumor extension and soft-tissue involvement. Evaluation of the growth plate is also essential as up to 75-88% of metaphyseal tumors do cross the growth plate into the epiphysis 4.  T1 soft tissue non-mineralized component: intermediate signal intensity mineralized/ossified components: low signal intensity peritumoral edema: intermediate signal intensity scattered regions of hemorrhage will have a variable signal (see aging blood on MRI) enhancement: solid components enhance    T2 soft tissue non-mineralized component: high signal intensity mineralized/ossified components: low signal intensity peritumoral edema: high signal intensity   Treatment and prognosisCure, if achievable, requires aggressive surgical resection often with amputation followed by chemotherapy. If a limb-salvage procedure is feasible, a course of multidrug chemotherapy precedes surgery to downstage the tumor, followed by wide resection of the bone and insertion of an endoprosthesis. The outcome depends on different factors such as age, sex, site, size, and type but the most important predictor is the histologic degree of necrosis post induction chemotherapy; 90% histologic necrosis is associated with much better prognosis 6. Currently, the 5-year survival rate after adequate therapy is approximately 60-80% 4.The most frequent complications of conventional osteosarcoma are a pathologic fracture and the development of metastatic disease, particularly to bone, lung and regional lymph nodes.Differential diagnosisGeneral differential considerations include the following: osteomyelitis other tumors metastatic lesion to bone Ewing sarcoma aneurysmal bone cyst   When the lesion is at the posteromedial distal femur, consider cortical desmoid Practical pointsWhen planning to biopsy a potential sarcoma, the treating surgeon should be consulted to plan the biopsy track as this will require excision to reduce the chance of seeding. A poorly planned track that crosses compartments can result in a more extensive resection, potentially with poor outcomes for the patient.

On this page:  Article: Terminology Epidemiology Clinical presentation Pathology Radiographic features Differential diagnosis References   Images: Cases and figures Imaging differential diagnosis   TerminologyThe specific type of otitis media depends on various clinical findings and setting:  acute otitis media: acute infection of the middle ear  otitis media with effusion: middle ear fluid without signs or symptoms of acute infection  adhesive otitis media: retracted tympanic membrane with adhesions to medial wall of tympanic cavity, with or without perforation  chronic otitis media: tympanic membrane perforation in the setting of recurrent infections of the middle ear benign/inactive chronic otitis media: dry tympanic membrane perforation  chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM): purulent drainage through perforated tympanic membrane chronic otitis media with effusion (formerly chronic serous otitis media): serous drainage through the perforated tympanic membrane    otomastoiditis: inflammation or infection from acute or chronic otitis media has spread to involve the mastoid EpidemiologyIt is most commonly seen in children.Clinical presentationIn acute otitis media, otalgia is the most common complaint. Other common signs and symptoms include otorrhea, hearing loss, headache, fever, and irritability. The otoscopic signs with the highest positive predictive value for acute otitis media are a bulging tympanic membrane followed by impaired mobility on pneumatic otoscopy 5. The redness of the tympanic membrane is less reliable but may be used to make the diagnosis in combination with other signs such as the presence of middle ear effusion.In otitis media with effusion, most cases are asymptomatic. When patients are symptomatic, the most common finding is mild conductive hearing loss.In chronic otitis media, the most common complaints are persistent otorrhea and hearing loss. Otoscopic examination demonstrates a perforated tympanic membrane.PathologyA mixture of factors predispose to otitis media, but Eustachian tube dysfunction or obstruction is thought to be one of the most important factors. Congenital palate defects, host immunity, and viral or bacterial infection may all be contributing factors.Radiographic featuresImaging is not usually required in cases of acute otitis media as the diagnosis is clinical. However, patients with chronic otitis media that present with hearing loss in whom the tympanic membrane cannot be visualized may require imaging. Exact imaging features vary depending on the form but in general includesCTHigh-resolution temporal bone CT is routinely performed and may show: soft tissue density in the middle ear cavity thickened tympanic membrane bulging tympanic membrane tympanic perforation Features seen in chronic rather than acute otitis media include: air-fluid level in the middle ear (effusion) bony erosion (less than 10%) adjacent sclerosis and hypopneumatisation of the mastoid MRIfluid signal in the middle ear cavity and mastoid antrum.Differential diagnosis  cholesteatoma causes disruption and erosion of the auditory ossicles mass-like appearance rather than dependent fluid can be difficult to exclude if the middle ear cavity is diffusely opacified    hemotympanum following trauma associated with skull base fracture

It is one of the leading causes of deafness in adults. On this page:  Article: Terminology Epidemiology Clinical presentation Pathology Radiographic features Treatment and prognosis History and etymology Related articles References   Images:Cases and figures  TerminologyThe term otosclerosis is somewhat of a misnomer. Much of the clinical course is characterized by lucent rather than sclerotic bony changes and hence it is more appropriately known as otospongiosis which is a term preferred by many head and neck radiologists. EpidemiologyTypically, patients present during their 4th and 5th decades. However, because the condition tends to have symptoms that gradually worsen, it is often difficult to precisely determine onset 6. Presentation during childhood is uncommon. A female predilection is present with a F:M ratio of ~2:1. Caucasians are more frequently affected than other racial groups 6,7. In up to 50% of cases, a familial predisposition can be identified 7.Histologic prevalence of otosclerosis has been reported between 3.4-10% in unselected Caucasian temporal bones 7.Clinical presentationOtosclerosis most commonly presents with hearing loss, most often conductive, but can also be sensorineural or mixed, and is frequently bilateral 3,9. The clinical course is usually slowly progressive over the years. Hearing loss may be exacerbated by pregnancy 6.On otoscopy, there are usually minimal or no findings, except in severe cases where cochlear involvement can result in hyperemia of the cochlear promontory (Schwartze sign) 1-3. On pure-tone audiometry, there may be a characteristic decrease in bone conduction at 2000 Hz (Carhart notch).PathologyThe pathophysiology of otosclerosis is multifactorial and incompletely understood, with genetic, viral, inflammatory and autoimmune components 9,10.Two phases are described: early/active (otospongiosis) and late/inactive (otosclerosis). In the early phase, lesions consist predominantly of histiocytes, osteoblasts and osteocytes, the latter being the most active cell group. The bone around pre-existing blood vessels is absorbed, creating a better microcirculation. Eventually, osteoblasts become more involved, resulting in the formation of irregular foci of new spongy bone 9. This new bone appears densely blue on hematoxylin and eosinophil staining and is known as the blue mantles of Manasse.SubtypesThere are two subtypes: fenestral (stapedial): ~80% involves the oval window and the stapes footplate hearing loss is often conductive, due to stapes thickening and fixation   retrofenestral (cochlear): ~20%  cochlear involvement with demineralization of the cochlear capsule hearing loss is often sensorineural, but the mechanism by which this occurs is uncertain   NB: the prefix 'retro' does not mean 'posterior' but rather 'behind', as in 'deep to', the medial wall of the middle ear from the perspective of otoscopy.Retrofenestral otosclerosis usually occurs with fenestral involvement, so the two entities are considered a continuum rather than distinct 11.Radiographic featuresCTThin-slice CT scan through the temporal bones, also called high-resolution CT, is the imaging modality of choice. Axial and coronal (or preferably 20 degrees coronal) thin-slice bone algorithm non-contrast scans are needed to adequately demonstrate the inner ear structures and subtle early changes 1-3.On imaging, two main types of presentations have been described:  fenestral the most common the site of involvement is just anterior to the oval window, involving a small cleft known as the fissula ante fenestram 5  bony overgrowth can cause fixation of the stapes    retrofenestral the second most common involvement of the round window niche, which when present usually accompanies fenestral disease 12. However, isolated round window otosclerosis can occur on occasion 12,13  the bone surrounding the cochlea is the site of involvement, which may be focal or circumferential 1-3, with the latter producing a "fourth turn" or "double ring" sign 14    Findings depend on the phase of the disease: otospongiotic phasethere are demineralization and formation of spongy bone, manifest as decreased attenuation (lucency) within the normally homogeneously dense border of the otic capsule  otosclerotic phase the region increases in attenuation as otosclerotic bone may be difficult to distinguish from surrounding normal bone, some have identified diagnostic criteria using the thickness of the otic capsule or an abnormally convex contour of the otic capsule cortex anterolateral to the anterior margin of the oval window 13in severe cases, the oval window and/or, less commonly, the round window is completely filled in by a dense bony plate (with complete fixation of the stapes)    CT grading system (Symons and Fanning)Various authors have used CT grading systems of otosclerosis in their studies. In 2009, a Lee et al 3 article assured that the Symons and Fanning CT grading system yields excellent interobserver and intraobserver agreement: grade 1solely fenestral, either spongiotic or sclerotic lesions, evident as a thickened stapes footplate, and/or decalcified, narrowed or enlarged round or oval windows  grade 2patchy localized cochlear disease (with or without fenestral involvement) grade 2A: basal cochlear turn involvement grade 2B: middle / apical turns involvement grade 2C: both the basal turn and the middle / apical turns involvement    grade 3diffuse confluent cochlear involvement of the otic capsule (with or without fenestral involvement)  MRIMRI has a limited role. In retrofenestral otosclerosis, pericochlear, and perilabyrinthine soft tissue intensity signal on T1 with contrast enhancement may be demonstrated. Increased T2 signal may also be present 8. Treatment and prognosisA stapedectomy with stapes prosthesis is the treatment of choice for fenestral otosclerosis 4.In the first part of the 20th century, a procedure referred to as fenestration was performed, in which a neo-window was created in the lateral semicircular canal or vestibule to allow passage of sound waves into the inner ear, bypassing the ossicular chain. These changes should not be mistaken with labyrinthine fistulae or middle and inner ear malformations 4.History and etymologyIt was first described by the Italian anatomist, Antonio Maria Valsalva (of the maneuver fame) in 1735.

Whilst FTA-Abs assays have high sensitivity and specificity (100% and 98% respectively) due to the very low levels of disease prevalence the positive predictive value is only 22%.2 Western blot assays are however able to confirm if the infection is active. Clinically, patients report vertigo that lasts minutes to hours, and the Tullio phenomenon may also be present, whereby motion of the tympanic membrane and ossicular chain (loud noise) can induce vertigo and nystagmus (Hennebert sign) in patients with otic syphilis, but may also occur in perilymph fistula and semicircular canal dehiscence.3Radiographic featuresRadiographic features are best appreciated on MRI: gummas may be seen in the internal auditory canal 4  there may be radiographic evidence of osteitis and osteolysis of the adjacent temporal bone 4  Furthermore, other manifestations of neurosyphilis may also be evident, in particular, those of acute syphilitic meningitis 4.

__label__Gynaecology Ovarian carcinoid tumors are very rare sub type of ovarian tumor. They are usually classified under ovarian germ cell tumors (monodermal teratoma 5). The term carcinoid tumor of the ovary can be used to described primary ovarian carcinoid tumors or metastatic carcinoid tumors to the ovary. The former are comparatively commoner. On this page:  Article: Epidemiology Pathology Radiographic features Related articles References   EpidemiologyAs a group they are thought to account for 0.3% of all ovarian tumors and 0.5% of carcinoid tumors. They are commonly seen in perimenopausal and postmenopausal women 5.PathologyPrimary carcinoid tumors of the ovary are divided into four main types: insular type: most common and the only type that is associated with the carcinoid syndrome 1  trabecular type strumal type: second commonest type mucinous type (goblet cell 4) AssociationsThe majority of primary ovarian carcinoids occur in association with mature cystic teratoma, but a considerable number present in pure form.Radiographic featuresGeneralPrimary carcinoids of the ovary are invariably unilateral. They form a solid nodule within a cystic teratoma, or form a pure solid hypervascular mass. They can be  indistinguishable from other solid neoplasms of the ovary 5.Lesions can markedly vary in size. Metastatic carcinoids are nearly always bilateral with scattered tumor deposits present  throughout both ovaries.

On this page:  Article: Epidemiology Clinical presentation Pathology Radiographic features Treatment and prognosis See also Related articles References   Images:Cases and figures  EpidemiologyThey account for less than 1% of ovarian tumors. Clinical presentationIn pre-menarchal patients, the tumors manifest with iso-sexual precocity (approximately 50% of cases) and other symptoms associated with excessive hormone production.PathologyA choriocarcinoma arising in association with the ovary can occur in a number of situations. The tumors may occur during or outside of pregnancy. A gestational ovarian choriocarcinoma may represent a metastasis from a uterine choriocarcinoma or much rarely arise from an ovarian ectopic pregnancy 1.Primary ovarian choriocarcinoma (non gestational ovarian choriocarcinoma) arises presumably from a germ cell and is extremely rare. These may be mixed with other germ cell tumors like immature teratoma, dysgerminoma or rarely occur in a pure form - pure primary choriocarcinoma of the ovary. The tumors are formed from placental trophoblastic elements. While most gestational choriocarcinomas show haematogenous spread, the non gestational choriocarcinoma tend to follow the lymphatic system.MarkersSerum β-HCG levels are often elevatedRadiographic featuresGeneralOn imaging, choriocarcinomas appear as vascular solid tumors with cystic, hemorrhagic, and necrotic areas. StagingThe staging depend on the original site of the tumor for metastatic gestional uterine choriocarcinoma - standard choriocarcinoma staging applies. from primary non gestational choriocarcinoma - staging ovarian cancer staging applies 6  Treatment and prognosisAs with choriocarcinoma in general, the tumors are capable of widespread metastases.  Choriocarcinoma is however extremely sensitive to chemotherapy, which is the mainstay of treatment. Since the disease is associated with a high incidence of metastasis and recurrence, the recommended management of primary extrauterine choriocarcinoma is often complete surgical resection followed by chemotherapySee alsoovarian tumors

On this page:  Article: Epidemiology Pathology Radiographic features See also Related articles References   Images:Cases and figures  EpidemiologyThey are rare ovarian tumors that occur predominantly in young women (majority occurring in the 2nd to 3rd decades 5).  Approximately 10-20% of cases occur in pregnancy.PathologyThe tumor is thought to arise from primordial germ cells and is considered the ovarian counterpart of seminoma of the testis. They are usually solid and multi-lobulated.MarkersThe tumors are usually hormonally inert 4 and in their pure form not associated with endocrine hormone secretion. However, syncytiotrophoblastic giant cells, which produce HCG, are present in 5% of dysgerminomas and can cause elevation of serum HCG levels.VariantsApproximately 15% of tumors can contain other malignant germ cell variants in which instance they are termed malignant mixed germ cell tumors of the ovary 5.LateralityApproximately 10-17% of tumors can be bilateral.Radiographic featuresUltrasoundMay be seen as a septated ovarian mass with varying echotexture. Color Doppler interrogation may show prominent flow signal within the fibrovascular septa 2.CTCalcification may be present in a speckled pattern. Characteristic imaging findings include multilobulated solid masses with prominent fibrovascular septa.

__label__Gynaecology An ovarian follicle (also known as a Graafian follicle in its mature state) is the basic unit of female reproductive biology and is composed of roughly spherical aggregations of cells and contains a single oocyte. On this page:  Article: Gross anatomy Radiographic features History and etymology Related articles References   Gross anatomyAn ovarian follicle can be initiated to grow and develop, culminating in ovulation of usually a single competent oocyte in humans. Approximately 10 ovarian follicles begin to mature during a normal menstrual cycle and out of these usually one will turn into a dominant ovarian follicle.During ovulation, the primary follicle forms the secondary follicle and then the mature vesicular follicle. After rupture, the follicle turns into a corpus luteum and eventually involutes to the corpus albicans. Radiographic featuresUltrasoundFollowing maturations under the development of gonadotropins, small follicles can be seen as small sonolucent rounded structures around the ovary. In the normal physiological state one of the follicles enlarges to ~1 cm to become a dominant follicle which grows further to ~2.5 cm 1. This is then called an ovarian follicular cyst.See the 1-2-3 rule.MRIOvarian follicles, as well as follicular cysts, may be seen as rounded structures around the ovary. Signal characteristics T2: high signal (as with many fluid-filled entities)History and etymologyIt is named after Reinier de Graaf, Dutch physician and anatomist (1641-1673).
__label__Gynaecology An ovarian follicular cyst is type of simple physiological ovarian cyst. On this page:  Article: Terminology Epidemiology Clinical presentation Pathology Radiographic features Treatment and prognosis References   Images:Cases and figures  TerminologyThe terms "ovarian cyst" and "ovarian follilcular cyst" are often used interchangeably. These two terms describe lesions >3 cm, and it is important to differentiate them from an "ovarian follicle" which is <3 cm.EpidemiologyThey present in women of reproductive age.Clinical presentationThey are asymptomatic and frequently present on routine pelvic scans.PathologyThey are a type of functional ovarian cyst and result from persistence of an unruptured Graafian follicle which then becomes larger in size.Natural courseThey generally resolve spontaneously in two to three cycles.Radiographic featuresUltrasound thin walled and unilocular usually range around 3 to 8 cm in sizeby definition, if <3 cm it is an ovarian follicle rather than an ovarian follicular cyst  there is typically posterior acoustic enhancement and an absence of internal echoes there should be no color flow, nodules or or any solid components. Treatment and prognosisSmall, simple presumed follicular cysts (<5 cm) in premenopausal patients can be left alone and require neither surgery nor imaging follow-up.  According to a recent consensus statement 6, yearly followup is suggested for cysts 5-7 cm, and large cysts (>7 cm) should ideally be assessed with MRI to exclude any subtle worrisome features, as it may be difficult to visualize these entirely with ultrasound.Follicular cysts do not occur in postmenopausal women.

Rarely, it may also occur as a spontaneous event in pregnancy (see spontaneous ovarian hyperstimulation later in the article).The clinical syndrome consists of ovarian enlargement with extra-vascular accumulation of exudates leading to varying degrees of weight gain increase in abdominal circumference ascites pleural effusions intravascular volume depletion with hemoconcentration oliguria  On this page:  Article: Epidemiology Clinical presentation Pathology Classification Radiographic features Treatment and prognosis Differential diagnosis Practical points Related articles References   Images: Cases and figures Imaging differential diagnosis   EpidemiologyThe syndrome is relatively common, occurring in ~5% of patients undergoing in vitro fertilisation (IVF). There is probably an even higher incidence of the syndrome in egg "donors" due to their young age ( which is a known risk factor for the disease) however there is a known problem of lack of reporting for such cases.Clinical presentationThe clinical picture may vary from abdominal distension and discomfort to potentially life-threatening capillary leak with fluid sequestration in a third space, and massive ovarian enlargement.  Pain, abdominal distention, nausea, and vomiting are frequently seen as symptoms.PathologyIt is characterized by massive cystic ovarian enlargement and fluid shift from the intravascular compartment into the peritoneal, pleural or pericardial cavities. The vascular fluid leakage is thought to result from an increased capillary permeability of mesothelial surfaces under the action of one or several vasoactive ovarian factors produced by multiple corpora lutea. Acute pelvic pain can result from stretching of the ovarian capsule or hemorrhage/rupture of a follicle.Risk factors baseline ovarian volume 8  background polycystic ovaries 9  low body weight 8  long ovulation induction cycle duration 8  Markersserum estradiol (E2) levels are elevatedSubtypesSpontaneous ovarian hyperstimulationThis subtype occurs in the absence of any external stimulation. This form can occur in pregnancy 15.There are also very rare sporadic forms which carry a genetic component. These have an association with early pubertal development and primary hypothyroidism (Van Wyk-Grumbach syndrome). Ovarian stimulation in the hypothyroid child may result in estrogen production, breast development, endometrial proliferation, and vaginal bleeding. It is likely that raised TSH concentrations bind and stimulate the FSH receptor, although a similar overlap phenomenon might occur at the level of the pituitary, with enhanced TRH production stimulating the GnRH receptor with subsequent ovarian enlargement. The cystic ovarian enlargement resolves with thyroid hormone replacement. A hyperstimulation phenomenon in patients with an abnormal FSH receptor has been described.ClassificationBased on the clinical manifestation and imaging findings, the modified Golan classification divides OHSS  into the following three categories with 5 grades 12,17:  mild OHSS: characterized by bilateral multicystic ovarian enlargement  grade 1: abdominal distention and discomfort  grade 2: plus nausea, vomiting and/or diarrhea plus ovarian enlargement from 5 to 12 cm    moderate OHSS: if there is associated ascites and abdominal distension grade 3: features of mild OHSS plus ultrasonographic evidence of ascites   severe OHSS: characterized by hypovolemia, hemoconcentration, thrombosis, oliguria, pleural and pericardial effusion  grade 4: moderate OHSS plus clinical evidence of ascites and/or hydrothorax and dyspnea  grade 5: grade 4 plus change in blood volume, hemoconcentration, coagulation abnormalities and diminished kidney perfusion and function   Radiographic featuresImaging findings can be similar on ultrasound, CT and MR imaging.Ultrasound typically shows bilateral symmetric enlargement of ovaries (often >12 cm in size) multiple cysts of varying sizes, giving the classic spoke-wheel appearance  associated ascites and pleural +/- pericardial effusion (which is due to capillary leak) may also be present Treatment and prognosisThe syndrome is usually self-limiting in most cases and management is mainly supportive, however, cases with fatal outcome have been reported 14. Severe cases usually require hospitalization and close monitoring of hematocrit, liver function, renal function, serum electrolytes and oxygen saturation.The profoundly altered maternal environment of OHSS is a significant risk factor for miscarriage, especially when occurring in the early phase after IVF (defined as <10 days after oocyte retrieval) 16.Complications  hypovolemic shock with resultant thromboembolic disease stroke   increased risk of ovarian torsion 6  Differential diagnosisFor ultrasound appearances in mild cases consider  polycystic ovaries  cysts are typically small no ascites or pleural effusions    theca lutein cysts associated with gestational trophoblastic disease: some also considered a part of OHSS mucinous ovarian malignancy  Practical pointsFamiliarity with ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome and the appropriate clinical setting should help avoid the incorrect diagnosis of an ovarian cystic neoplasm. On encountering severe forms not suspected by the clinician suggesting the diagnosis may reduce both morbidity and mortality.
__label__Gynaecology Ovarian hyperthecosis (OHT) is a condition where there is a presence of luteinized thecal cells within a hyperplastic ovarian stroma. On this page:  Article: Clinical presentation Pathology Radiographic features Treatment and prognosis Differential diagnosis References   Images:Cases and figures  Clinical presentationClinical manifestations include hyperandrogenism, obesity, hypertension, and impaired glucose tolerance. Virilization has been reported to be more common in premenopausal women, whereas oestrogenic effects seem more common in postmenopausal women.PathologyThe ovarian stroma is at least moderately hyperplastic and has luteinized thecal cells which may occur as single cells, small nests, or occasionally nodules.OHT and polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) are manifestations of the same heterogeneous disturbance of androgen metabolism. Histopathological differentiation between PCOS and OHT exists in the location of luteinized thecal cells. In OHT they exist within the stroma and in PCOS they exist along the periphery of the follicle.Laboratory findingsTestosterone and dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate (DHEA-S) is the first hormones to be measured. Testosterone levels are nearly always above the postmenopausal range and are higher than the levels observed in PCOS. Imaging of the adrenal glands and ovaries is warranted if the serum total testosterone level is >150 ng/dL.Associations endometrial hyperplasia  endometrial carcinoma probably due to increased androgen production by luteinized thecal cells, which then serve as precursors for estrogen production ovarian fibrothecoma Radiographic featuresUltrasoundVariable appearance but most ovaries appear normal. They may have a nodular appearance. Increased ovarian size with increase in the ovarian stroma may also be seen; however, unlike PCOS the number of follicles tend to be normal. The ovarian size is increased beyond the expected limits in postmenopausal women. MRIRole of MRI is yet to be proven. Symmetric bilateral ovarian enlargement, with homogeneous T2-hypointensity and mild enhancement of the ovaries, may be seen.A CT or MRI of the adrenals is important for women with high levels of DHEA-S. Treatment and prognosis postmenopausal women: bilateral oophorectomy is suggested; however, if the patient has multiple comorbidities, then long-term GnRH agonist treatment may be an option when malignancy has been excluded premenopausal women: treatment is the same as for PCOS; once malignancy has been excluded Differential diagnosis  polycystic ovarian syndrome: may have a similar appearance, but with multiple numbers of small follicles ovarian fibroma

__label__Gynaecology Mucinous cystadenocarcinoma of the ovary is a rare malignant ovarian mucinous tumor. This type can account for 5-10% of all ovarian mucinous tumors. It is a type of ovarian epithelial tumor.  On this page:  Article: Pathology Radiographic features Treatment and prognosis See also Related articles References   Images: Cases and figures Imaging differential diagnosis   PathologyRetrospective studies have suggested that many mucinous carcinomas initially diagnosed as primary to the ovary have in fact metastasized from another site 4.Associationsa development of mucinous cystadenocarcinoma has been very rarely associated with malignant transformation of a mature cystic teratoma 1 Radiographic featuresIn general, the cell type (e.g. serous, mucinous) often cannot be determined on the basis of appearance at MR imaging, CT, or ultrasound 6. Biopsy or excision is necessary.General Mucinous tumors are typically multilocular, with numerous smooth, thin-walled cysts. Mucoid material is found within the cysts, sometimes accompanied by hemorrhagic or cellular debris. The imaging appearances are variable depending on the proportion of mucinous content. A proportionately greater solid/nodular, non-fatty, non-fibrous tissue is often considered the most powerful predictor of malignancy 6. Thick septa and solid nodules usually exhibit enhancement. Mucinous ovarian carcinoma is less likely to be bilateral than serous carcinoma, with bilateral lesions occurring in 5-10% of the stage I cases. They often present as large masses spanning >6 cm.Ultrasoundappearance is similar to an ovarian mucinous cystadenoma, but with mural thickening, solid components, or aggressive featuresCTCT may demonstrate high attenuation in some loculi due to the high protein content of the mucoid materialMRI  T1 the signal intensity of mucin on T1-weighted images varies depending on the degree of mucin concentration on T1-weighted images, loculi with watery mucin have a lower signal intensity than loculi with thicker mucin    T2on T2-weighted images, the corresponding signal intensities are flipped, so that loculi with watery mucin have a high signal intensity and loculi with thicker mucin appear slightly hypointense  StagingThe staging is the same as general ovarian cancer staging.Treatment and prognosisOften presenting as large masses at stage I disease, the most conventional means of treatment are tumor-debulking operations and neoadjuvant chemotherapy. The latter may be performed pre- or post-operatively. The estimated median survival when presenting at an advanced stage is significantly shorter (14 months) compared to ovarian serous cystadenocarcinoma (42 months) 4.See alsoovarian tumors
__label__Gynaecology Mucinous cystadenoma of the ovary is at the benign end of the spectrum of mucin-containing epithelial ovarian tumors. On this page:  Article: Epidemiology Pathology Radiographic features Treatment and prognosis See also Related articles References   Images:Cases and figures  EpidemiologyThe estimated peak incidence is at around 30-50 years of age. They comprise approximately 80% of mucinous ovarian tumors and 20-25% of all benign ovarian tumors.PathologyThe tumors are lined by columnar epithelium, typically similar to endocervical epithelium, though occasionally an intestinal type may be seen. These cells secrete thick, gelatinous mucin which fills the locules 5. Radiographic featuresMucinous cystadenomas tend to be larger than serous cystadenomas at presentation 1. Bilaterality is rare (2-5%). Mural calcification is more common than serous tumors 6. Ultrasound typically large cystic adnexal mass multilocular with numerous thin septations loculations may contain low-level internal echogenicity due to increased mucin contentdifferent locules may contain various degrees of echogenicity  MRIMucinous cystadenomas are usually seen as large multilocular cysts containing fluid of various viscosity. Due to this reason, the loculi of the tumors often show variable signal intensities on both T1 and T2 sequences. This can sometimes give a “stained glass” appearance. They rarely appear as unilocular cysts.Treatment and prognosisA mucinous cystadenoma is benign with excellent prognosis (c.f. borderline mucinous tumors of the ovary or mucinous cystadenocarcinoma of the ovary). Nonetheless, they are frequently surgically excised for histological confirmation of benignity, and due to mass effect of the large tumors.See alsoovarian tumors
__label__Gynaecology Ovarian mucinous tumors are a subgroup of ovarian epithelial tumors. They represent 10-15% of all ovarian tumors and ~10% of all malignant ovarian tumors. They are subdivided according to their malignant potential and clinical behavior into: ovarian mucinous cystadenoma ovarian borderline mucinous tumor ovarian mucinous cystadenocarcinoma  On this page:  Article: Clinical presentation Pathology Radiographic features Treatment and prognosis Differential diagnosis Related articles References   Images: Cases and figures Imaging differential diagnosis   Clinical presentationBenign mucinous tumors tend to affect women 20-40 years old, whereas borderline and malignant tumors tend to occur in a slightly older age range (40-50 years of age) 6,PathologyOn histology they show multiple cysts lined by mucinous epithelium, often resembling gastrointestinal-type epithelium 6. KRAS mutations are a common feature.SubtypesMucinous ovarian tumors can be broadly subclassified into three main subgroups:  ovarian mucinous cystadenoma: ~80 %  ovarian borderline mucinous tumor: ~10-15 %   ovarian mucinous cystadenocarcinoma: ~5-10 %  Radiographic featuresIn general, the cell type (e.g. serous, mucinous) often cannot be determined by the appearance on imaging 5. While some of the specific features can vary between the subtypes, there are certain features which are more common among mucinous tumors: 3 often larger than their serous counterparts (on occasion they may be enormous) tend to be more multilocular with small cystic components +/- honeycomb-like locules calcification is comparatively rare and if present tends to be linear usually unilateral  peritoneal carcinomatosis is less common compared with serous tumors may have accompanying pseudomyxoma peritonei  MRI  T1 signal intensity of locules varies depending on the degree of mucin concentration loculi with watery mucin have a lower signal intensity than loculi with thicker mucin    T2 the above-mentioned corresponding signal intensities are flipped so that loculi with watery mucin have a higher signal intensity and loculi with thicker mucin appear slightly hypointense the combination of locules with different signal intensities may result in a "stained glass appearance"   Treatment and prognosisPrognosis of mucinous tumors is highly dependent on the stage and histologic composition: see individual subtypes for further details.

__label__Gynaecology Ovarian serous cystadenocarcinoma is the malignant form of ovarian serous tumor, the most common type of ovarian epithelial tumor. It is the most common type of ovarian malignancy.Increasingly, high-grade serous carcinoma and low-grade serous carcinoma are recognized as distinct tumor types rather than a spectrum of disease grade as implied by the nomenclature (see Pathology for more). On this page:  Article: Terminology Epidemiology Pathology Radiographic features See also Related articles References   Images:Cases and figures  TerminologySerous ovarian tumors are traditionally described with a "cyst-" prefix because of their primarily cystic composition, e.g. cystadenoma, cystadenocarcinoma.EpidemiologyAccount for the largest proportion of malignant ovarian tumors 1, representing over 50-80% of all malignant epithelial ovarian tumors 4. Serous ovarian cystadenocarcinomas account for ~25% of serous tumors.The incidence peaks around the 6th to 7th decades of life 2. PathologyMacroscopic appearancemultilocular cystic ovarian tumor with papillary projectionsMicroscopic appearance classified as high-grade versus low-grade carcinoma 9: high-grade serous carcinoma (HGSC) common (70-80%) thought to originate from distal fallopian tube epithelium  high grade nuclear features (e.g. nuclear pleomorphism, abnormal mitotic figures) characterized by intratumoral heterogeneity  nearly ubiquitous p53 positivity    low-grade serous carcinoma (LGSC) uncommon (~5%) 9  thought to mostly represent malignant degeneration of serous cystadenoma 9      psammomatous bodies may be present in either LGSC or HGSC, but more numerous in LGSC 9  Risk factorsRecognized risk factors include: nulliparity early menarche  late menopause positive family history infertility Markers elevated serum CA-125 (>90% of cases 6)StagingSee ovarian cancer staging.Radiographic featuresImaging plays an important role in the diagnosis of ovarian tumors and in the assessment for metastatic disease. However, surgical evaluation is the standard of care for staging of disease.Typical imaging features of ovarian cystadenocarcinoma include: cystic adnexal mass with a substantial solid component calcification uncommon, but can be seen (~12%) 4also seen in serous cystadenoma and other tumors  frequently bilateral In the setting of suspected ovarian cystadenocarcinoma, features suggestive of extra-ovarian metastasis include:  ascites - often of disproportionately large volume 3  peritoneal nodularity lymphadenopathy Ultrasound mixed cystic/solid lesion more heterogeneous than a serous cystadenoma  papillary projections, thick septations, and/or solid components   ascites concerning for peritoneal metastatic spread discrete peritoneal deposits may be seen   color Doppler is useful to confirm vascularity of the solid componentsquantitative parameters (resistive index (RI) and pulsatility index (PI)) do not reliably predict malignancy  CTCT may be used for preoperative evaluation to assess for metastatic disease, e.g. peritoneal nodularity, ascites, or intrathoracic lesions.MRIMRI provides the most detailed imaging evaluation for ovarian malignancies and may be used in either preoperative evaluation or post-treatment follow up.  T1  ​cystic portions are T1 dark, unless there has been intralesional hemorrhage (keep in mind mucinous tumors also have brighter T1 appearance in the cystic component) solid portions are T1 intermediate    T2 cystic portions are T2 bright solid portions are T2 intemediate    T1 C+: solid portions enhance  DWI/ADC solid components restrict diffusion metastases may exhibit restricted diffusion may The cystic components are high T2, low T1 signal unless there has been intralesional hemorrhage (c.f. , where there is typically slightly increased T1 signal of the cystic component).

__label__Gynaecology Ovarian serous cystadenomas are a type of benign ovarian epithelial tumor at the benign end of the spectrum of ovarian serous tumors. On this page:  Article: Terminology Epidemiology Clinical presentation Pathology Radiographic features Treatment and prognosis Differential diagnosis See also Related articles References   Images:Cases and figures  TerminologySerous ovarian tumors are traditionally described with a "cyst-" prefix because of their primarily cystic composition, e.g. cystadenoma, cystadenocarcinoma.EpidemiologySerous cystadenomas account for ~60% of ovarian serous tumors 1. They are the commonest type of ovarian epithelial neoplasm. The peak incidence is at the 4th to 5th decades of life.Clinical presentationGenerally asymptomatic. If symptoms are present, they are usually related to mass effect with displacement of adjacent structures, e.g. loops of bowel, adnexal torsion.PathologyEtiologyThought to largely derive from ovarian epithelial inclusions, which itself is derived from fallopian tube epithelium.LocationThey can be bilateral in ~15% of cases.Macroscopic appearanceSerous cystadenomas are usually composed of unilocular (or at times multilocular) cysts filled with clear watery fluid. The cysts measure 10 cm in average diameter, but may be extremely large. The lining of the cyst is flat or may contain small papillary projections. Microscopic appearanceComposed of a solitary layer of benign epithelium which resembles fallopian tube mucosa and may form papillary structures. As with other serous tumors, psammomatous calcification can be a feature.Radiographic featuresUltrasound usually seen as a unilocular cystic/anechoic adnexal lesion papillary projections are absentif there is any wall irregularity, it is thin, with an acute angle with the cyst wall and has a regular surface 5   some lesions may contain sonographically detectable septations no flow is detected on color doppler higher resistive and pulsatility indices on pulsed doppler when compared to malignant neoplasms CTOften seen as a unilocular (typically) or multilocular cystic mass with homogeneous CT attenuation, with a thin regular wall or septum, and usually no endocystic or exocystic vegetation 1,4. Cysts can be quite large in size and have the potential to be seen filling most of the lower pelvis with extension into the upper abdomen.MRIThe typical MR imaging appearance of serous cystadenoma is a unilocular thin walled adnexal cyst 2. MRI may show a beak sign which may suggest an ovarian origin.Signal characteristics within the cyst are usually homogeneous.  T1: cyst content is generally of hypointense signal in uncomplicated cases  T2: cyst content is of fluid (hyperintense) signal  T1 C + (Gd): enhancement of cyst wall sometimes occurs after contrast administration Treatment and prognosisThey are benign lesions usually with a good prognosis. However, ovarian cystadenocarcinoma is thought to result from ovarian cystadenoma evolution into serous borderline tumors and invasive carcinoma. Surgical options include resection or oophorectomy. Cystadenomas do not recur following oophorectomy.Differential diagnosisGeneral imaging differential considerations include:  ovarian cysts: for small lesions consider ovarian functional cysts such as follicular cysts  corpus luteum cysts: occurs in pre-menopausal women     ovarian mucinous tumors: usually larger and multilocular  serous cystadenocarcinoma: thick septa with solid components  paraovarian cysts: no beak sign  paraovarian cystadenoma: no beak sign endometrioma  mature teratoma: calcification and fat content See alsoovarian tumors
__label__Gynaecology Ovarian serous neoplasms are the commonest of four general types of the epithelial ovarian tumors, and are more prevalent than the mucinous ovarian tumors.Serous ovarian neoplasms are subdivided into benign, borderline, and malignant lesions according to their malignant potential and clinical behavior (see Pathology - Classification section below). On this page:  Article: Epidemiology Pathology Radiographic features Differential diagnosis See also Related articles References   Images: Cases and figures Imaging differential diagnosis   EpidemiologyApproximately 60% are benign and ~15% of borderline malignancy; These occur most commonly in women of reproductive age. The malignant tumors comprise of 25% of cases and tend to occur in older patients.  PathologySerous ovarian tumors are defined by a histologic resemblance to normal Fallopian tubal epithelium 5.ClassificationThe most recent 2014 WHO classification system for serous ovarian neoplasia identifies three categories of tumor:  benign - no cellular proliferation or invasion serous cystadenoma serous cystadenofibroma serous surface papilloma    borderline - cellular proliferation + minor nuclear atypia without invasionborderline serous cystadenoma   malignant - cellular proliferation + nuclear atypia + stromal invasion low grade serous carcinoma  high grade serous carcinoma - most common serous carcinoma (85-90% serous carcinomas), highest associated mortality 6    Radiographic featuresImaging evaluation may be performed preferably with ultrasound or MRI, with CT usually reserved for staging purposes. In general, the cell type (e.g. serous, mucinous) often cannot be determined on the imaging basis of appearances. Serous ovarian tumors are typically smaller than mucinous tumors on presentation. They are typically unilocular and homogeneous. They are often bilateral, and this is particularly so for the malignant subtypes. Psammomatous calcification is a feature of serous, but not mucinous subtypes. Features that suggest a malignant over a benign cystic neoplasm include:  large cystic mass thick irregular walls and septa papillary projections large soft tissue component ascites evidence of invasive spread or adenopathy Differential diagnosisConsiderations include:  ovarian functional cyst usually smaller thin walls with no septations  tend to change or resolve in the next menstrual cycle    para ovarian cystovaries can be individualized apart from the cyst    ovarian mucinous tumors tend to be multiseptated  often larger than serous tumors monolateral rather than bilateral cystic loculi with variable signal intensities on MRI giving the appearances of "stained glass"   See also ovarian tumor ovarian cancer staging  benign serous cystadenoma / serous cystadenofibroma  borderline cystadenoma malignant serous cystadenocarcinoma

On this page:  Article: Epidemiology Clinical presentation Pathology Radiographic features Treatment and prognosis See also References   Images:Cases and figures  EpidemiologyThey are rare and only account for ~0.5% of all ovarian tumors. While they can present at any age, they typically present <30 years old, with a mean age of 14 years.Clinical presentationIn ~30-50% of patients, the presenting symptoms are related to clinical signs of androgenic activity 6. Many patients have symptoms of virilization depending on the quantity of androgen production. A small subset are hyperoestrogenic.Hormonally inactive tumors often have a nonspecific presentation such as an abdominal mass and/or pain. The majority of patients present with stage I disease.PathologyMost tumors are unilateral (>90% of cases) and confined to the ovaries. These tumors are characterized by the presence of testicular structures that produce androgens. However, only 30% are hormonally active.Ovarian SLCTs can be divided into four subtypes: well-differentiated intermediately-differentiated poorly-differentiated retiform The tumors may contain heterologous elements in approximately 20% of cases. These can, in turn, be further separated into two basic types: endodermal and mesenchymal. Heterologous hepatic differentiation is responsible for elevated AFP levels 11.Variants pure Sertoli cell tumor of ovary 10:Radiographic featuresSLCTs are usually unilateral.UltrasoundImaging features are nonspecific and variable. SLCT may manifest as a well-defined, enhancing solid mass 3 or as a cystic lesion 6.

__label__Gynaecology Ovarian torsion, also sometimes termed adnexal torsion or tubo-ovarian torsion, refers to rotation of the ovary and portion of the fallopian tube on the supplying vascular pedicle. It can be intermittent or sustained and results in venous, arterial and lymphatic stasis. It is a gynecological emergency and requires urgent surgical intervention to prevent ovarian necrosis.  On this page:  Article: Epidemiology Clinical presentation Pathology Radiographic features Treatment and prognosis Differential diagnosis Practical points Related articles References   Images:Cases and figures  EpidemiologyOvarian torsion has a bimodal age distribution occurring mainly in young women (15-30 years) and post-menopausal women. Approximately 20% of the cases occur during pregnancy 1.Torsion occurs due to two main reasons 2:  hypermobility of the ovary: <50% adnexal mass: ~50-80% most lesions are dermoid cysts or paraovarian cysts  large cystic ovaries undergoing ovarian hyperstimulation are at particular risk masses between 5-10 cm are at most risk 13    Clinical presentationMost patients present with severe non-specific lower abdominal and pelvic pain, either intermittent or sustained, nausea, and vomiting. There is adnexal tenderness. A raised white cell count is common.PathologyThe result of vascular compromise secondary to ovarian torsion is hemorrhagic infarction and necrosis, that can occur as rapidly as within hours of torsion onset.Torsion of a normal ovary more commonly occurs in young children when developmental abnormalities predispose the ovary to torsion, such as excessively long Fallopian tubes or an absent mesosalpinx.In adulthood, causes include both benign and malignant ovarian tumors, polycystic ovaries and adhesions. In early pregnancy, a torsion can occur secondary to a corpus luteal cyst or laxity of the adjacent tissues.Radiographic featuresThe main feature of torsion is ovarian enlargement due to venous/lymphatic engorgement, edema, and hemorrhage. Secondary signs include free pelvic fluid, an underlying ovarian lesion, reduced or absent vascularity and a twisted dilated tubular structure corresponding to the vascular pedicle. Adnexal torsion is commonly unilateral, with a slight (3:2) right-sided predilection (presumably due to the protective effects of the sigmoid colon on the left) 6,8.UltrasoundUltrasound is the initial imaging modality of choice. Sonographic features include enlarged (>4 cm) ovary variable echogenicity (hypo- or hyperechoic)a long-standing infarcted ovary may have a more complex appearance with cystic or hemorrhagic degeneration  peripherally displaced follicles with hyperechoic central stroma midline ovary position free pelvic fluid may be seen in >80% of cases an underlying ovarian lesion may be seen (possible lead point for torsion) Doppler findings in torsion are widely variable 3  little or no ovarian venous flow (common; sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 97%) 14  absent arterial flow (less common, sign of poor prognosis) absent or reversed diastolic flow normal vascularity does not rule out intermittent torsionnormal Doppler flow can also occasionally be found due to dual supply from both the ovarian and uterine arteries     whirlpool sign of twisted vascular pedicle 3  ovary tenderness to transducer pressure 13  CT good at ruling out ovarian torsion if a normal ovary/adnexa is seen on ultrasound the twisted ovarian pedicle is pathognomonic for ovarian torsion if demonstrated 11  torsion appears as a complex adnexal lesion representing enlarged ovary (>4.0 cm 11) distended pedicle  possible underlying ovarian lesion   HU >50 on non-contrast CT suggests hemorrhagic necrosis 2  lack of enhancement may be seen surrounding fat stranding, edema, and free fluid MRINot the imaging modality of choice if torsion is suspected, as urgent imaging is required.If hemorrhagic infarction is present, signal changes include 4:  T1 thin rim of high signal (methemoglobin) without contrast enhancement  endometriomas and hemorrhagic corpus luteal cysts are less likely to have a high T1 rim and do not usually involve the entire ovary    T2: can have low signal due to interstitial hemorrhage Treatment and prognosisUrgent surgery is required to prevent ovarian necrosis. Most ovaries are not salvageable, in which case a salpingo-oophorectomy is required. If not removed, the necrotic ovary can become infected and cause an abscess or peritonitis. In the case of a non-infarcted adnexa, surgical untwisting can be performed. Mortality resulting from ovarian torsion is rare. Spontaneous detorsion has also been reported.Differential diagnosisFor an enlarged edematous ovary +/- Fallopian tube, consider:  pelvic inflammatory disease (PID): has a very different clinical presentation massive ovarian edema (MOO) oophoritis Practical points the ovary should be tender to transducer pressure absence of ovarian Doppler flow is highly specific for torsion, but normal Doppler flow does not completely rule out torsion an ovarian mass causing the torsion must always be sought

__label__Urogenital __label__Vascular __label__Gynaecology Ovarian vein syndrome is a relatively rare condition where a dilated ovarian vein (ovarian venous varix) causes notching, dilatation, or obstruction of the ureter. This is usually secondary to varicoses of the ovarian vein or ovarian vein thrombosis and occurs at the point where the ovarian vein crosses the ureter.History and etymologyIt was first reported in 1964 by Clark 3.See alsopelvic congestion syndrome

On this page:  Article: Epidemiology Pathology Radiographic features Treatment and prognosis See also Related articles References   Images:Cases and figures  EpidemiologyOvarian yolk sac tumor is a rare malignant ovarian germ cell tumor that usually occurs around the second decade of life. It is considered the most common malignant germ cell tumor of the ovary in children 4. The overall occurrence is rare, however.PathologyThey are typically well-encapsulated round to oval masses.Associationsoccasionally an ovarian yolk sac tumor can arise from a pre-existing ovarian dermoid cyst Markersaffected patients have an elevated serum tumor marker AFP Radiographic featuresTypically, yolk sac tumors manifest as a large, complex pelvic mass that extends into the abdomen and contains both solid and cystic components. The cystic areas are composed of epithelial lined cysts produced by the tumor or of co-existing mature teratomas. Bilaterality is rare.UltrasoundTends to have both echogenic and hypoechoic components 4.MRIThey can be associated with prominent signal voids on MRI 2. Areas of hemorrhage can also be seen.Treatment and prognosisThese tumors tend to grow rapidly and had a poor prognosis in the past, but now the prognosis has improved with the use of new therapies (platin or carboplatin, etoposide, bleomycin). Early lymphatic spread, as well as invasion, is common.See alsoovarian tumors
__label__Gynaecology The ovaries are paired female gonads of the reproductive and endocrine systems. They lie within the ovarian fossa on the posterior wall of the true pelvis.  On this page:  Article: Gross anatomy Blood supply Lymphatic drainage Innervation Variant anatomy Radiographic features Related pathology Related articles References   Gross anatomyThe ovaries are firm and ovoid in shape and measure approximately 1.5-3.0 cm × 1.5-3.0 cm × 1.0-2.0 cm (length x width x thickness) (corresponding to a volume of 1.2-9.4 cm3). An ovary typically weighs 2-8 g, however, they change during life and double in size in pregnancy. Typically they lie on the peritoneum of the pelvic wall in a shallow fossa in the angle between internal and external iliac vessels on the obturator nerve but have variable location secondary to their mobility. They are oriented with their long axis oblique, with lateral and medial surfaces, uterine and tubal ends, and mesovarian and free borders. The suspensory ligament of the ovary, a peritoneal fold, runs from the side wall of the pelvis to the ovary. The ovarian vessels run in this ligament, crossing over the external iliac vessels.Each ovary is attached to the posterior lamina of the broad ligament by the mesovarium, which is continuous with its outer coat. A third attachment, the ovarian ligament, is a continuation of the round ligament and attaches the ovary to the side of the uterus.Despite all its attachments, the ovary is very mobile, especially in women who have had children. It is frequently found behind the uterus in the pouch of Douglas and has a variable relationship with the uterus: anteflexed uterus: lateral or posterolateral retroflexed uterus: superolateral Relations anteriorly: broad ligament, mesovarium, obliterated umbilical artery posteriorly: ureter, internal iliac vessels, suspensory ligament with ovarian vessels superiorly: external iliac vessels inferiorly: levator ani  medially: ovarian ligament attaching ovaries to uterus, pararectal fossa and rectouterine pouch, bowel loops laterally: obturator vessels and nerves in ovarian fossa, obturator internus and fascia, parietal peritoneum of pelvic wall 3,4  Blood supply arterial supply: ovarian artery (primarily)  venous drainage: pampiniform plexus to the ovarian veins: right ovarian vein drains into the inferior vena cava  left ovarian vein drains into the left renal vein    Lymphatic drainage drain alongside the ovarian vessels either to para-aortic nodes, or  follow para-uterine vessels to iliac nodes, or  alternative routes include to inguinal nodes via round ligament or reaching the contralateral ovary by passing across the fundus of the uterus  Innervation sympathetic supply from T10 and T11 spinal segments via aortic plexus and its branches  parasympathetic supply from inferior hypogastric plexus via uterine artery responsible for vasodilatation sensory fibers accompany sympathetic nerves Variant anatomy suprapelvic position on psoas major inguinal canal location spheroidal, flattened, crescentic shape supernumerary ovaries absence or hypoplasia of one or both ovaries ectopic adrenal or thyroid tissue polycystic ovary   Radiographic featuresUltrasound first-line investigation homogeneous echotexture with a central echogenic medulla volume on ultrasound can be calculated with the following formula 5:  0.523 × length (cm) × width (cm) × depth (cm) volume is expressed in cubic centimeters (cm3)   CT can be difficult to identify or may be confused with enlarged lymph nodes 5  its position may be determined by the following techniques 5:  anterior or anterolateral to the pelvic ureter if in a typical position tracking the ovarian vein from the IVC or left renal artery anterior to the psoas major to the region where the ovary lies suspensory ligament of the ovaryusually, extends from the ovary to the external or common iliac vessels; most easily identifiable pelvic ligament    the ovary can be differentiated from lymph nodes, which are extraperitoneal and displace the ureter medially or anteromedially or efface the common iliac vessels when enlarged 5  Related pathology Müllerian duct abnormalities ectopic pregnancy: ovarian pelvic inflammatory disease endometriosis ovarian cyst ovarian dermoid ovarian cancer

It is comparable to the Agatston score but has the advantage of being able to be performed on non-dedicated cardiac scans without dedicated post-processing 1; it has yet (c. 2019) to be validated in the wider radiological community with one study performed by subspecialist thoracic radiologists on low-dose CT thorax exams for lung cancer screening 1. 
__label__Gastrointestinal Fecal impaction is a sequela of long term constipation, whereby a hard fecal mass in the rectum prevents defecation from occurring. The resultant rectal dilatation leads to smooth muscle relaxation of the internal anal sphincter. Concurrently the obstructing stool mass leads to increased secretions in the upstream colon. This combination of secretions and particulate/fluid stool matter seeps around the rectal feces. This may be reported by the patient as diarrhea, for which the clinicians may apply the misnomer overflow diarrhea.

__label__Central __label__Nervous __label__System __label__Paediatrics __label__Chest Oxygen (chemical symbol O) is one of the basic organic elements, and is a constituent of most of the known organic molecules - and therefore all lifeforms - on earth.  On this page:  Article: Chemistry Toxicity Radiological importance History and etymology Related articles References   ChemistryBasic chemistryOxygen is a colourless odorless diatomic gas with an atomic number 8 and atomic weight 15.999. It has a melting point of -219°C and a boiling point of -183°C 1. It is mainly found in its diatomic form, O2. In the high atmosphere, it is commonly found as ozone, O3, its triatomic form.RadiochemistryThe stable isotope oxygen-16 accounts for more than 99.7% oxygen found on earth. Tiny percentages of oxygen-17 and oxygen-18 make up the remainder of the naturally-occurring oxygen 2.ToxicityOf course, oxygen is vital for the treatment of hypoxic states, however pure 100% oxygen is potentially toxic. The development of a hyperoxic state as may occur when administering high flow oxygen gas to an unwell patient can lead to the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), primarily the superoxide anion (O2-●​), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), and the hydroxyl radical (HO●). The hydroxyl radical has the severest injurious effects in the body. These free radicals can overwhelm the human body's innate defenses and lead to deleterious effects 3.NB: '●' symbol indicates the presence of an unpaired electron and partially accounts for the highly reactive and damaging nature of these molecular species.Clinically, oxygen toxicity may lead to:Pulmonary toxicity acute lung injury (ALI) acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) CNS toxicityIf the oxygen is being inhaled at higher than normal atmospheric pressures, then high-pressure oxygen toxicity (a.k.a. Paul Bert effect) may occur, with severe deleterious CNS effects 3: abrupt-onset seizures, usually rapidly followed by coma (30-60 minutes)usually lethal  also: nausea, muscular spasms, dizziness, visual impairment, delirium  Radiological importance oxygen-16 may be employed to synthesize radioactive nitrogen-13 for use in ammonia molecules in myocardial PET 2  oxygen-17 has been usefully employed as a tracer to assess cerebral oxygen usage 2   oxygen-enhanced MRI is an emerging technique to study hypoxic tumors in vivo 6  In the presence of oxygen (O2), biological tissues are more sensitive to ionizing radiation (oxygen effect) 7  History and etymologyOxygen was discovered by J Priestley and CW Scheele in 1774 1. However it was not until 1786 that the word oxygen was coined by the French chemists Morveau and Lavoisier 4.The word oxygen is from the French word oxygène, which itself was derived from the Ancient Greek words οξυς (oxys) meaning acid and γεν (-gen) meaning producing, i.e. an acid-producing substance 4,5.

In the uterine cervix, p16 positivity supports the diagnosis of a high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL). Testing p16 positive in a squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck indicates an HPV-related etiology and confers, particularly in the oropharynx, a better prognosis.
__label__Musculoskeletal Pachydermoperiostosis (PDP) refers to a rare osteoarthrodermopathic syndrome with familial and idiopathic forms. It is also known as primary hypertrophic osteoarthropathy because it is not due to a secondary cause such as lung disease. On this page:  Article: Terminology Epidemiology Clinical presentation Pathology Radiographic features History and etymology References   TerminologyAlso known as Touraine-Solente-Golé syndrome, named after the three French physicians who described it in 1935 (see below).EpidemiologyPDP most commonly affects black people and adolescent boys.Clinical presentationPDP is characterized by marked thickening of the skin of the extremities, face, and scalp (including cutis verticis gyrata). PathologyPDP is an autosomal dominant inherited disorder that is self-limiting and progresses for several years by stabilizing. Radiographic featuresPlain radiograph/CTSkeletal findings include symmetric, shaggy subperiosteal bone formation in the long bones, especially of the forearm and leg bones, but also of the metacarpals, metatarsals, and phalanges.Involvement of the epiphyseal region distinguishes it from the secondary form, in which the epiphyses are usually spared 2.There can be a widening of the ends of bones, especially in the wrist and knee joints which are due to increased bone formation. The generalized and symmetric periosteal reaction in pachydermoperiostosis tends to blend with the cortex and primarily involves the distal ends of the radius, ulna, tibia, and fibula.History and etymologyAlthough not the first to describe the entity, the French physicians, Albert Touraine (1883-1961), G Solente and L Golé, were the first to recognize pachydermoperiostosis as a primary form of hypertrophic osteoarthropathy in 1935 4,5.

Placing immobilization devices to ensure the patient is faced down with their hips flexed will allow for increased stability in positioning.
__label__Paediatrics The supine cross-table lateral view is an additional projection to demonstrate the pediatric abdomen.

__label__Paediatrics The anteroposterior erect chest view is ideal in younger cooperative pediatric patients (approximately 3-7 years old; this age range is only a guide). This chest view examines the lungs, bony thoracic cavity, mediastinum and great vessels.The AP erect view is often chosen over the PA erect view for younger children as this view allows for observing the child’s breathing and decreased patient stress (due to the child being able to observe what is happening in the room). However, the AP view will result in an increased radiation dose to radiosensitive organs and magnify the heart and mediastinum 1. The choice to perform a PA erect or AP erect chest view will depend on the radiographer’s judgment of the patient’s cooperative and understanding ability.

Examples include: “you have to breathe in like you are about to blow out a birthday candle!” “take a big sniff now” “lets play dead fish!” “freeze!” ImmobilizationThe AP erect chest view is often associated with using the parent or a staff member to hold the child’s arms above their head. However, research regarding the most effective method of immobilization is lacking. It is suggested to try explanations and distraction before automatically assuming the patient requires physical holding 5.Specialized equipmentSpecialized pediatric departments will have 'chairs' appropriate to hold children during examination 5, these chairs often contain multiple Velcro strap points, are counterweighted for stability and have a radiolucent backing such as perspex. It is important when using this equipment that the children is safely fastened with no risk of falling. In extreme cases, the parent may stand in front of the patient ensuring they feel safe.
__label__Paediatrics The horizontal beam pediatric lateral chest view is a modified lateral projection often utilized in populations under the age of 6 months old due to the inability of that patient to independently hold up their head.There is a body of research that suggest the lateral projection is not required for the detection of pneumonia in the paediatic patient 1,2. The appropriateness of a lateral chest x-ray in the paediatic patient will differ from institution to institution.  On this page:  Article: Patient position Technical factors Image technical evaluation  Practical Points Related articles References   Images:Cases and figures  Patient position the patient is supine, placed on a radiolucent sponge to ensure the entirety of the chest is imaged arms are held above the patients by either a carer, nurse or external velcro straps.

Departments will either have specialized equipment or utilize the carer/parent, radiographer, or nurse to maintain the child's position.Specialized equipmentSpecialized pediatric departments will often have immobilization devices that possess multiple velcro attachment points to ensure the patient is not moving during the examination. The appropriateness in using these devices will vary greatly from region to region.  Personnel immobilizing the patientWhen specialized equipment is not available, yet a lateral cross table projection is required, the radiographer may nominate themselves, a carer/parent or the nurse to maintain a correct patient position. The patient should be placed on a radiolucent sponge to ensure no artifact from the table/bed is present, arms will be placed above head (placing them behind the head restricts movement and is most effective) and the legs kept still to avoid movement. 
__label__Paediatrics The pediatric lateral chest view may be performed as an adjunct to a frontal chest radiograph in cases where there is diagnostic uncertainty. The lateral chest view examines the lungs, bony thoracic cavity, mediastinum, and great vessels.

__label__Paediatrics In pediatric imaging, the anteroposterior supine chest x-ray is beneficial for imaging unconscious or uncooperative patients. This view is preferred in infant and neonate imaging, whilst AP erect and PA erect views are ideal for children able to cooperate in sitting or standing 1.As radiation protection is necessary for pediatric patients, it is essential to image the chest properly and avoid unnecessary repeats. If the pediatric patient can only manage a supine view, this is more ideal than performing a poor erect view.

__label__Urogenital __label__Paediatrics The pediatric cystic renal diseases are a heterogeneous group of conditions defined by the presence of kidney cysts due to hereditary or non-hereditary causes: isolated simple cyst   cystic renal dysplasia multicystic dysplastic kidney (MCDK) obstructive cystic renal dysplasia   genetic disorders autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease (ARPKD) autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) nephronophthisis-medullary cystic disease complex (NPH-MCKD)  renal cysts and diabetes syndrome (RCAD) (HNF1B-associated disease, maturity-onset diabetes of the young type 5) Bardet-Biedl syndrome Joubert syndrome related disorders Jeune syndrome Meckel-Gruber syndrome tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) Zellweger syndrome   complex cystic tumors  cystic nephroma and cystic partially differentiated nephroblastoma (CPDN) Wilms tumor (nephroblastoma) mesoblastic nephroma renal cell carcinoma   acquired cystic kidney disease Radiographic featuresUltrasound is the first-line modality for investigating kidney cysts, which appear as anechoic areas in the renal parenchyma 1.Ultrasound of the liver and female internal genitalia is also recommended at first evaluation of cystic kidney disease to identify signs of associated pathology (liver cysts, hepatic fibrosis, portal hypertension, Müllerian duct anomalies) 1. If there is a concern for malignancy on finding complex cysts, contrast-enhanced MRI is recommended.Radiology reportAn international working group made the following suggestions for reporting investigations of pediatric cystic kidney disease 1. Size: The kidney should be measured using midsagittal length, as well as width and depth at the level of the hilum, which allows estimation of kidney volume by the prolate ellipsoid formula. Parenchyma: The renal parenchyma should be assessed by the cortical echogenicity (compared to the liver) and corticomedullary differentiation (normal, absent, or reversed), as very small cysts can solely manifest as increased echogenicity. Cysts: The presence of macroscopic cysts should be described by their number (1, 2-5, 6-10, or >10), side (unilateral or bilateral), location (cortical, medullary, corticomedullary border, ubiquitous), and size (maximal diameter of the largest cyst). Abnormal features suggestive of bleeding, infection, or malignancy should be documented, such as calcification, wall thickening, septations, echogenic debris, or hypervascularity of the septations or wall. Urinary tract: Urinary tract dilation should be identified, as it may be confused for cysts. Additionally, obstruction may be the cause of cystic renal dysplasia.

__label__Musculoskeletal __label__Paediatrics The frog leg lateral view is a special radiographic of the pelvis to evaluate the hip. Some departments will perform this routinely instead of the AP pelvis view to reduce exposure and maintain high diagnostic accuracy 1.  On this page:  Article: Indication Patient position Technical factors Image technical evaluation Practical points Radiation protection considerations Related articles References   Images:Cases and figures  IndicationBilateral examination allows for better visualization of the hip joints and femoral neck. It is almost exclusively used in the pediatric population.

This is to avoid the child rotating their pelvis to look at their parent; this will require clear instructions for the parents to follow so that they do not allow rotation of the child's pelvis or motion artifact from kicking if the parent is accompanying the child by holding them in position, whilst the parent puts on a lead gown, it is the radiographer's responsibility to ensure the baby does not roll off the x-ray table Radiation protection considerations If the pediatric patient can be kept still using other methods such as distraction techniques, or swaddling, this is ideal to avoid scattered radiation to parents and staff 3  lead shielding may be used in some departments, for pediatric patients; nevertheless, as x-ray dose reduction technology advances; the consequence of missing valuable information obscured by lead shielding and requiring a repeat should be considered, especially for first presentation 4  in some institutions, pediatric patients with hip pain may be assessed with a single frog leg view to reduce radiation exposure. This is evidence to support this approach, but individual practice will vary by department 5  
__label__Paediatrics Pediatric immobilization relates to techniques used to keep children still for medical imaging examinations. Since radiation dose can affect children up to ten times more than adults 1, it is important to keep the radiation dose to a minimum. One method of achieving this is by avoiding repeat imaging due to motion artefact. Immobilization techniquesImmobilization techniques often vary depending on the department. In general, techniques that are used include 2: distraction techniques verbal techniques physical holding by the parent or radiographer Velcro straps sandbags swaddling feed and sleep sedation The decision to use various techniques are either through departmental protocol or by the judgment of the radiographer. As the patients' age and maturity may affect the type of technique used, studies have shown a potential need for specific immobilization guidelines to assist radiographers 2,3. Immobilization vs restraintImmobilization refers to keeping a child still with their consent. Restraint refers to using physical force to hold the child still without their consent 4. Restraining children can increase anxiety and post-traumatic stress for future imaging procedures. In practice, however, children are often unable to give consent and physical force is difficult to quantify. It can then be suggested that verbal and distraction techniques are most ideal when imaging children.To avoid restraint, some reflections can be made: has consent been obtained from the child?

__label__Paediatrics __label__Hepatobiliary The PRETEXT system proposed by the International Childhood Liver Tumors Strategy Group (previously called Société Internationale d’Oncologie Pédiatrique - Epithelial Liver Tumor Study Group - SIOPEL) aims for staging and risk stratification of liver tumors at diagnosis. It is used to describe tumor extent before any therapy, thus allowing more effective comparison between studies conducted by different groups. The liver tumors could be staged by interpretation of CT or ultrasound with or without additional imaging by MRI. Original system was created to classify hepatoblastomas, but after its revision in 2005 it can be used for any tumor lesion of the liver in children1.This system is based on Couinaud’s segmentation of the liver. The liver segments are grouped into sections: left lateral section: segments 2 and 3 left medial section: segments 4a and 4b right anterior section: segments 5 and 8 right posterior section: segments 6 and 7 The caudate lobe of the liver was initially ignored. PRETEXT number and its definition: one section is involved and three adjoining sections are free one or two sections are involved, but two adjoining sections are free tumor involves three liver sections and one liver section is free of tumor or tumor involves two liver sections and two non-adjoining liver sections are free of tumor all four sections are involved, there is no liver section free of tumor Stage increases and prognosis decreases as the number of liver sections radiologically involved with tumor increases from one to four.In 2005 the revision of the system was performed and a number of additional categories were proposed1. They include:  caudate lobe involvement (letter C) extrahepatic abdominal disease (E) tumor focality (F) tumor rupture or intraperitoneal hemorrhage (H) distant metastases (M) lymph node metastases (N) portal vein involvement (P) and  Involvement of the IVC and/or hepatic veins (V) PRETEXT system divides patients into two risk groups:   high-risk group can be characterized by following features: PRETEXT number IV serum alpha-fetoprotein <100 μg/l presence of additional PRETEXT criteria from groups E, H, M, N, P, and V   the rest of patients belong to the standard risk group

These masses are often found incidentally on imaging but can be readily apparent clinically. On this page:  Article: Clinical presentation Pathology Radiographic features References   Clinical presentationThe clinical features of these lesions tend to mimic upper respiratory processes and may result in delayed diagnosis due to this. As symptoms are often non-specific, imaging is usually required to evaluate these lesions.PathologyLesions can arise from structures of the nose, nasopharyngeal mucosa, or adjacent anatomical structures. There is a wide range of underlying conditions that can result in pediatric nasal cavity masses, and these can largely be grouped into non-neoplastic and neoplastic disorders:  non-neoplastic disorders congenital and developmental congenital nasolacrimal duct mucocele nasal midline masses   infectious and inflammatory cysts polyps nasal septal abscess   vascular: nasal pyogenic granuloma  trauma: septal hematoma  foreign body    neoplastic disorders benign neoplasms infantile hemangioma juvenile nasopharyngeal angiofibroma giant cell tumor nasal pleomorphic adenoma aneurysmal bone cyst fibro-osseous lesions   malignant neoplasms rhabdomyosarcoma leukemia, lymphoma nasopharyngeal carcinoma metastatic disease: neuroblastoma  esthesioneuroblastoma     Radiographic featuresCT and MRI are important in characterizing these lesions.

This is to avoid the child rotating their pelvis to look at their parent; this will require clear instructions for the parents to follow so that they do not allow rotation of the child's pelvis or motion artifact from kicking if the parent is accompanying the child by holding them in position, whilst the parent puts on a lead gown, it is the radiographer's responsibility to ensure the baby does not roll off the x-ray table if other methods can be used such as distraction techniques, or swaddling, this is ideal to avoid scattered radiation to parents and staff 3

On this page:  Article: Epidemiology Clinical presentation Pathology Radiographic features References   EpidemiologyPediatric urinary tract infections affect up to 2.8% of all children every year, with approximately 2% of boys and 8% or more of girls developing a urinary tract infection at some stage during childhood.More frequent in boys until three months of age, after that it mainly affects girls.Clinical presentationIt is important to realize that in children symptoms may be nonspecific.Clinical features suggestive of UTI in a child under five years include: vomiting poor feeding lethargy irritability abdominal pain or tenderness urinary frequency or dysuria offensive urine or hematuria In patients under two years look out for: pyrexia of unknown origin feeding disorder diarrhea slow weight gain failure to thrive sepsis PathologyUrinary tract infection is usually defined as a pure growth of at least 100,000 organisms/ml of a single strain of bacterial pathogen.For urinary infection to be called 'recurrent',  it needs to be a symptomatic and proven UTI, which is adequately treated and then recurs.Radiographic featuresUltrasoundUltrasound is the first line investigation: assess renal morphology, echogenicity and position of kidneys observe congenital abnormalities: horseshoe, pancake, dysplasia, etc. greater than 10% size difference indicative of renal scarring assess bladder morphology Voiding cystography is performed >6/52 after the acute phase.DMSA is carried out after 6/12 (to allow for resolution of acute inflammatory changes). This represents the gold standard in assessing for renal scarring.If there is a clinical concern of vesicoureteric reflux, micturating cystography can be performed.There are four types performing micturating cystography:  micturating (voiding) cystourethrography (MCUG): requires fluoroscopy direct isotope cystography (DIC): isotope Tc99 is introduced into the bladder via the urethra and the kidneys are imaged with a gamma camera indirect isotope cystography: may be done as part of a MAG 3 study voiding ultrasonography (echo-enhanced cystosonography): no ionizing radiation

On this page:  Article: Clinical presentation Pathology Radiographic features History and etymology References   Images:Cases and figures  Clinical presentationPatients present with hypertension, which may be recognized acutely after an inciting event or following a delay 3. In the acute setting, patients may complain of flank pain. Reduced renal function may be noted.PathologyCompression of the kidney results in compression of the intrarenal vessels, which leads to decreased blood flow to the renal parenchymal tissue and induction of renin secretion. Renin-angiotensin system activation results in hypertension.EtiologyPatients usually have an inciting event that leads to the development of a subcapsular collection, such as trauma or surgery. In some cases, spontaneous rupture of a mass, aneurysm, or cyst can be responsible 3.Radiographic featuresAll modalities will demonstrate a collection surrounding the kidney, of variable density/intensity/echogenicity depending on the nature of the collection. The collection is usually subcapsular in location, maintaining a reniform contour. Importantly, however, the adjacent renal parenchyma should be distorted.UltrasoundOn Doppler evaluation, renal arterial resistive index is elevated 4.CTOn contrast-enhanced examination, the affected kidney may demonstrate a delayed nephrogram.History and etymologyThis phenomenon was first described by Irvine H (Heinley) Page (1901-1991) 5,6 in 1939 2 when he discovered that hypertension could be produced in a dog by wrapping one or both kidneys in cellophane. Dr Page, was a renowned American cardiologist and is remembered for his research into hypertension, in particular his discovery of serotonin and his work on the renin-angiotensin system. 
__label__Musculoskeletal Paget disease of the bone is a common, chronic bone disorder characterized by excessive abnormal bone remodelling.

There may be a slight male predilection. Incidence can be considerably higher in the United Kingdom than in other countries 8. It is also common in Australia, New Zealand, Western Europe, and the United States.Clinical presentationThe majority (approximately three-quarters) of patients are asymptomatic at the time of diagnosis.

Viral infection (paramyxovirus) 6 in association with genetic susceptibility has been postulated.There are three classically described stages, which are part of a continuous spectrum 22: early destructive stage (incipient active, lytic): predominated by osteoclastic activity intermediate stage (active, mixed): osteoblastic as well as osteoclastic activity late stage (inactive, sclerotic/blastic) These stages correlate well with the imaging findings.Markers elevated serum alkaline phosphatase normal calcium and phosphorus levels increased urine hydroxyproline Radiographic featuresSignsThere are many Paget disease-related signs, listed here and described in the modality-specific sections below:  tam o' shanter sign: not an eponym blade of grass sign osteoporosis circumscripta  jigsaw pattern bone or mosaic pattern bone  picture frame vertebra cotton wool appearance of bone banana fracture Looser zones ivory vertebra sign Mickey Mouse sign Lincoln sign Plain radiographPlain radiographic features will depend upon the phase of the disease.The early phase features osteolytic (lucent) regions which are later followed by coarsened trabeculae and bony enlargement. Sclerotic changes occur much later in the disease process.Additional destructive features may become apparent if malignant transformation occurs. Skull  osteoporosis circumscripta: large, well-defined lytic lesions involving the inner aspect of the outer table of the skull (stage one) with a preserved inner table.  cotton wool appearance: mixed lytic and sclerotic lesions of the skull.  diploic widening: both inner and outer calvarial tables are involved, with the former usually more extensively affected  tam o'shanter sign: frontal bone enlargement, with the appearance of the skull falling over the facial bones, like a tam o'shanter hat Spine  picture frame sign: Paget disease of the spine frequently manifests with cortical thickening and sclerosis encasing the vertebral margins, which gives rise to this appearance on radiographs in mixed-phase disease  squaring of vertebrae: on lateral radiographs, flattening of the normal concavity of the anterior margin of the vertebral body also adds to the rectangular appearance  vertical trabecular thickening: coarser than the more delicate pattern seen in intraosseous hemangiomas with which it may be confused Pelvis cortical thickening and sclerosis of the iliopectineal and ischiopubic lines results in the pelvic brim sign and leads to obliteration of Köhler's​ teardrop  acetabular protrusion enlargement of the pubic rami and ischium  These findings are often asymmetric, and for some reason, are more commonly seen on the right side.Long bones  blade of grass or candle flame sign: begins as a subchondral area of lucency with advancing tip of V-shaped osteolysis, extending towards the diaphysisin rare cases, the disease is isolated to the diaphysis, most commonly in the tibia, rather than subchondral bone, which can cause diagnostic confusion  lateral curvature (bowing) of the femur anterior curvature of the tibia MRIThe overall signal characteristics are variable, likely reflecting the natural course of the disease process in different phases.Several major patterns of involvement have been described 8,16: dominant signal intensity in Pagetic bone similar to that of fat; most common pattern and probably corresponds to longstanding disease relatively low T1 and high T2 signal alteration (also referred as a “speckled” appearance); second most common pattern: probably corresponds to granulation tissue, hypervascularity, and edema seen in early mixed active disease low signal intensity on both T1 and T2 images; suggesting the presence of compact bone or fibrous tissue; least common pattern: seen in late sclerotic stage Fatty marrow signal is usually preserved in all sequences unless there is a complication 10.Bone scintigraphyTc-99m-MDP is highly sensitive but not specific.

__label__Breast __label__Oncology Paget disease of the breast, which is also known as Paget disease of the nipple, has traditionally been described as a form of breast malignancy characterized by infiltration of the nipple epidermis by malignant cells. Although most cases have underlying focus or foci of in situ or invasive carcinomas, some cases of Paget disease are confined to the skin of the nipple-areola without underlying neoplastic foci. On this page:  Article: Epidemiology Clinical presentation Pathology Radiographic features Treatment and prognosis History and etymology Related articles References   Images:Cases and figures  EpidemiologyThe condition can represent 1-5% of breast malignancies. The average age at diagnosis is around the 6th decade (53-59 years).Clinical presentationEczematous appearing changes of the nipple include reddening, scaling, hyperkeratosis, and crusting of the nipple surface.Clinical stagingMammary Paget disease can be classified into four clinical stages:  stage 0: lesion is confined to the epidermis, without underlying ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) of the breast  stage 1: associated with DCIS just beneath the nipple  stage 2: associated with extensive DCIS  stage 3: associated with invasive ductal carcinoma  PathologyIn most cases of Paget of the breast, there are malignant ductal cells that extend to the nipple surface through the terminal lactiferous ducts.Malignant epithelial (Paget) cells infiltrate and proliferate in the epidermis, causing an eczema-like rash of the nipple and the areolar skin. There are several histologic variants of Paget disease including: adenocarcinoma-like cell type spindle cell type anaplastic cell type acantholytic cell type pigmented cell type Radiographic featuresMammographyMammary Paget disease can be undetectable on mammography in ~50% of cases 2. Features that may be evident on mammography include skin thickening, nipple retraction, subareolar or more diffuse malignant microcalcifications, and discrete subareolar mass(es).Breast MRIMR imaging may play an important role in the selection of patients with Paget disease for breast-conserving therapy if there is no clinical or mammographic evidence of breast carcinoma. Abnormal nipple enhancement and linear clumped enhancement indicative of DCIS in association with Paget disease.Treatment and prognosisTraditionally, treatment has been a mastectomy with nodal dissection. However, with MRI, breast-conserving therapy is more frequently being used.History and etymologyPaget disease of the breast is named after Sir James Paget (1814-1899), the British surgeon and pathologist, who first described it in 1874 6.

__label__Chest __label__Vascular Paget-Schrötter syndrome, alternatively spelled Paget-Schroetter syndrome and also known as effort thrombosis, refers to primary thrombosis of the axillary and/or subclavian vein. It can be thought of as a venous equivalent of thoracic outlet syndrome. On this page:  Article: Epidemiology Clinical presentation Pathology Radiographic features Treatment and prognosis History and etymology References   Images:Cases and figures  EpidemiologyIt is associated with forced abduction of the upper limb and most commonly seen in young athletes who use repetitive shoulder-arm motions, e.g. weight-lifters, wrestlers, baseball pitchers or tennis players. Clinical presentationPatients present with symptoms and signs of an upper limb deep vein thrombosis (i.e. arm pain and swelling).PathologyCompression of the subclavian vein when it passes through the costoclavicular space is the most favored mechanism of thrombosis. Various surrounding structures that lie in close proximity to subclavian vein, when it passes through the costoclavicular space, have been postulated to cause the compression.Radiographic featuresThe presence of thrombus can be confirmed on ultrasound or venography. CT or MRI of the thoracic inlet is used to search for a cause of the extrinsic compression.  Treatment and prognosisThe thrombus is treated with anticoagulation and catheter-directed thrombolysis, after which surgical decompression is performed. Following surgical decompression, if there is residual venous stenosis on repeat venography, angioplasty of the lesion is performed. Stenting is avoided where possible due to the poor long-term patency rate, and must only be performed after surgical decompression otherwise the stent may be crushed or fractured.History and etymologyThe first detailed case was described by the British surgeon and pathologist Sir James Paget (1814-1899) 4 in 1875. The German laryngologist Leopold von Schrötter Ritter von Kristelli (1837-1908) 5 identified vascular trauma as a potential cause in 1894. The term Paget-Schroetter syndrome was first used by Hughes in 1948 3. 
__label__Gastrointestinal __label__Musculoskeletal There are a number of pain rating scales used by clinicians and researchers to gauge the severity of patients' pain. Commonly used methods:  pain numeric rating scale (NRS/NPRS)  visual analog scale (VAS)  verbal rating scale (VRS)  faces pain scale-revised (FPS-R)  On this page:  Article: Pain numeric rating scale Visual analog scale Verbal rating scale Faces pain scale-revised References   Pain numeric rating scaleThe pain numeric rating scale (NRS), a.k.a. numeric pain rating scale (NPRS), employs an 11-point scale, ranging from '0' for no pain, to '10' for the worst pain imaginable.Visual analog scaleThe visual analog scale (VAS) is a line, horizontal or vertical, usually 10 cm in length, with 'no pain' written at one end and 'worst possible pain' written at the other end. Patients are asked to mark on the line where they think the severity of their pain would be. Verbal rating scaleThe verbal rating scale (VRS), a.k.a. verbal pain score (VPS) or verbal descriptor scale (VDS), uses written questions, with descriptors as answers, for patients to indicate which of them applies to their pain.Faces pain scale-revisedThe faces pain scale-revised (FPS-R) uses pictures of faces showing expressions of increasing discomfort. It is ideal for younger children, poor readers and the cognitively-impaired.

On histology, there are disordered arrangements of hyperplastic neurons admixed with astrocytes and minimal white matter which shows varying degrees of myelination 3.Craniofacial abnormalities are thought to be a result of disruption of the midline development by the hypothalamic hamartoma 3.Radiographic featuresMRI is the imaging modality of choice for hypothalamic hamartoma. They appear as non-calcified, non-enhancing and homogeneously isointense to grey matter on T1 weighted images and often hyperintense on T2 weighted images 3. These findings are helpful in distinguishing hypothalmic hamartoma from more common suprasellar lesions such as craniopharyngioma 3.Treatment and prognosisPrognosis in those with no known family history is based on the severity of the malformations present.

__label__Musculoskeletal The interossei muscles, form part of the intrinsic muscles of the hand, and as a group consist of four palmar (1st is often rudimentary) and four dorsal muscles. Collectively the interossei contribute to abduction and adduction of the fingers and also contribute to flexion of the metacarpophalangeal joints (MCPJ) and extension of the interphalangeal joints (IPJ) through their insertion to the extensor hood. The reference axis through which abduction and adduction occur is the long axis of the 3rd phalanx (middle finger).

There are four muscles in this group, however, the 1st is rudimentary and often considered part of either the adductor pollicis or the flexor pollicis brevis 1,3. They adduct the thumb, index, ring and little fingers along the long axis of the middle finger. Just like the dorsal interossei, the tendons pass deep to the transverse metacarpal ligament.There is no palmar interosseous muscle for the third digit as it cannot be adducted towards itself.RelationsThe first palmar interosseous lies anterior to the first dorsal interosseous. The adductor pollicis crosses anterior to both the heads of the first and second palmar interossei. The flexor tendons of flexor digitorum superficialis and profundus similarly overlap the third and fourth palmar interossei.Blood supplyPalmar interossei are largely supplied by branches from the deep palmar arch, princeps pollicis and palmar metacarpal arteries.Clinical pearlsThe mnemonic “PAD” and “DAB” can be used to help remember the different functions of the two muscle groups.

The orientation and position of the symbol are such that if the mouth were to be divided by a cross from the viewpoint of the dental practitioner looking into the mouth, the symbol reflects the two line segments of the cross bounding that quadrant: right upper (maxillary) quadrant = ┘  left upper (maxillary) quadrant = └  left lower (mandibular) quadrant = ┐  right lower (mandibular) quadrant = ┐  Therefore, the notation 1┘ indicates the permanent right upper central incisor.When listing multiple teeth, they may be depicted within the same line diagram structure, but this is difficult to demonstrate using standard text formatting on word processors and websites 1.Primary teethThe deciduous teeth are lettered A through E from mesial to distal in each quadrant 2: central incisor = A lateral incisor = B canine = C 1st molar = D 2nd molar = E The bracket symbols for each quadrant is as in the permanent teeth.Therefore, the notation B┐indicates the primary right lower lateral incisor.History and etymologyThe system is named after Corydon Palmer, a dentist from Ohio, United States, who modified the system developed by Adolf Zsigmondy, a dentist from Hungary.See also Fédération Dentaire Internationale (FDI) notation American Dental Association (ADA) Universal Numbering System 
__label__Central __label__Nervous __label__System Palmini classification of focal cortical dysplasia published in 2004 was one of the leading classification systems used for focal cortical dysplasia, recently replaced by a newer classification; Blumcke classification of focal cortical dysplasia. Unfortunately, as is the case with many classification systems that have developed in parallel with numerous iterations and revisions, there is significant overlap between the various classifications systems with the same terminology used slightly differently. The Palmini classification divides focal cortical dysplasia into three groups: mild malformation of cortical development (mild MCD), type I and type II.   mild MCD type I: with ectopically placed neurons in or adjacent to layer I type II: with microscopic neuronal heterotopia outside layer I​    type I: architectural abnormalities with no dysmorphic neurons or balloon cells type IA: isolated architectural abnormalities type IB: architectural abnormalities, plus giant or immature, but not dysmorphic neurons     type II: architectural abnormalities with dysmorphicneurons  (Taylor-type focal cortical dysplasia) type IIA: without balloon cells type IIB: with balloon cells

__label__Head __label__& __label__Neck __label__Chest Pancoast syndrome (historically known as Ciuffini-Pancoast-Tobías syndrome, Hare syndrome or variation thereof) results from involvement of the brachial plexus and sympathetic chain by a Pancoast tumor or, less commonly, from other tumors - or even non-malignant disease - involving the lung apex.Clinical presentationThe syndrome consists of: shoulder pain C8-T2 radicular pain Horner syndrome The classical syndrome is uncommon, with Horner syndrome present in only 25%.History and etymologyPancoast syndrome as a result of apical lung tumors was described in a number of publications (by Hare in 1838, Ciuffini in 1911 and Tobias in 1932) before Pancoast reported it using the term 'superior pulmonary sulcus tumor' 2-4.   Edward Selleck Hare (1812-1838), British physician  Publio Ciuffini (18??-19??), Italian physicianCiuffini, is mentioned in non-referenced sources 2, an original reference remains elusive   Henry Khunrath Pancoast (1875-1939), American radiologist, Philadelphia  Jose W Tobias, Argentine physician, Buenos Aires 4  
__label__Oncology __label__Chest Pancoast tumor, also known as superior sulcus tumor, refers to a relatively uncommon situation where a primary lung cancer arises in the lung apex and invades the surrounding soft tissues. Classically a Pancoast syndrome results, but in actuality this is only seen in one quarter of cases.  On this page:  Article: Terminology Epidemiology Clinical presentation Pathology Radiographic features Treatment and prognosis History and etymology Differential diagnosis Related articles References   Images:Cases and figures  TerminologyThe term superior pulmonary sulcus is now discouraged, both as a discrete anatomical entity and as a site for the origin of malignancy. It is an unhelpful term, not least because most formal anatomical texts do not even mention it as a structure. Moreover, there is no consistent usage in the literature as to what it actually refers to 12. Using the term "superior sulcus tumor" is imprecise and unneeded, as in all situations a 'lung apical tumor' would suffice as an alternative.  Notwithstanding the above, the term superior sulcus tumor is still seen in the radiological, medical and surgical literature. For the remainder of the article whenever Pancoast tumor or apical lung tumor is mentioned, the term superior sulcus tumor can be substituted, although we discourage its use.Definitions vary from author to author, with some only referring to Pancoast tumors if the histology is a non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and treating other apical tumors separately (even though any apical malignancy can cause Pancoast syndrome) 7; and some only referring to Pancoast tumors if they have presented with Pancoast syndrome and call the rest apical tumors. Others use the term apical tumor and Pancoast tumor interchangeably, but limit the use to bronchogenic carcinomas, while others include all tumors that involve the thoracic apex (whether or not they arise from the lung).For the sake of simplicity, we have taken the middle road. For this article pulmonary apex tumor and Pancoast tumor are used interchangeably to refer to a primary bronchogenic carcinoma with an apical pulmonary origin.EpidemiologyPancoast tumors account for 3-5% of all bronchogenic carcinomas and have similar demographics to other lung cancers (see bronchogenic carcinoma article for a discussion of demographics and risk factors) 5,8.Clinical presentationAlthough classically apical lung tumors present with Pancoast syndrome, this is only the case in approximately 25% of cases 1. The missing element is usually Horner syndrome.The most common symptoms at presentation are chest and/or shoulder pain, with arm pain being also common. Weight loss is frequently present 5.PathologyApical lung tumors are usually non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC). The most common histology encountered historically in this region were squamous cell carcinomas 6,7, however, more recently, and in keeping with the overall shift in frequency, bronchogenic adenocarcinomas are now more frequently identified 8.Radiographic featuresPlain radiographPlain films demonstrate a soft tissue opacity at the apex of the lung. Occasionally rib involvement or extension into the supraclavicular fossa may be evident. Lordotic views may be helpful.UltrasoundThe role of ultrasound is limited, but it may be useful in aiding percutaneous biopsy as it can visualize the external component of the tumor via an intercostal or supraclavicular acoustic window 3.CTAlthough, as is the case with bronchogenic cancer at other locations, CT is the workhorse for diagnosis, it has poor sensitivity (60%) and specificity (65%) for accurate local staging 7. It is, however, excellent at identifying bony involvement.MRIMRI is helpful in the assessment of pulmonary apical tumors due to its excellent demonstration of soft-tissue involvement and is far more sensitive (88%) and specific (100%) for local staging 7.Careful assessment of the brachial plexus is important as the involvement of more than the lower trunk, or C8 nerve root, is usually considered inoperable 7.The anatomy lends itself particularly to imaging in the coronal and sagittal plane, and the T1 sagittal images offer most of the required information 2,8.PET-CTAs for bronchogenic carcinomas in general, it is useful for assessing nodal and distant metastases at the baseline staging. For Pancoast in particular, PET-CT permits an accurate delineation of the gross tumor volume, which will be essential for the radiation treatment planning 8. Treatment and prognosisTreatment depends crucially on the extent of involvement notably through the apex, as these lesions usually involve the brachial plexus and subclavian vessels. In such lesions, radiotherapy is typically administered in an attempt to downstage the tumor sufficiently to allow for attempted resection 2.Much controversy nonetheless exists over exact inclusion and exclusion criteria for surgery and the timing and administration of radiotherapy and chemotherapy.Despite advances in management, prognosis remains poor with an overall 5-year survival of only 36%. Complete resection is the most important factor in determining survival 5: complete resection achieved - 45% 5-year survival incomplete resection only - 0% 5-year survival History and etymologyPancoast syndrome as a result of superior sulcus tumors was described in some publications (Hare 1838 and Ciuffini in 1911) before Pancoast reported it using the term 'superior pulmonary sulcus tumor' in 1924 5,8,9:  Edward Selleck Hare (1812-1838), British physician, who died tragically at the age of 26 years from typhus 10   Publio Ciuffini , Italian physician: it is stated elsewhere that Ciuffini, a bona fide Italian physician of the early 20th century, described this entity in 1911, however an original reference remains elusive  Henry Khunrath Pancoast (1875-1939) 11, American radiologist Differential diagnosisGeneral imaging differential considerations include: pulmonary metastases mesothelioma  primary chest wall tumors Ewing sarcoma PNET   chest wall metastases apical pleural thickening secondary to e.g. previous pulmonary tuberculosis  In addition a number of plain film mimics should be considered, including: vascular lesions: e.g. carotid pseudoaneurysm 4  anterosuperior mediastinal masses 
__label__Gastrointestinal __label__Hepatobiliary The pancreas (plural: pancreata) is a retroperitoneal organ that has both endocrine and exocrine functions: it is involved in the production of hormones (insulin, glucagon and somatostatin), and also involved in digestion by its production and secretion of pancreatic juice. On this page:  Article: Gross anatomy Arterial supply Variant anatomy Related pathology Related articles References   Images:Cases and figures  Gross anatomyThe pancreas may have the shape of a dumbbell, tadpole or sausage. It can be divided into four main parts: head: thickest part; lies to the right of the superior mesenteric vessels (superior mesenteric artery (SMA), superior mesenteric vein (SMV)) uncinate process: extension of the head, posterior to SMV attached to "C" loop of duodenum (D2 and D3)   neck: thinnest part; lies anterior to SMA, SMVSMV joins splenic vein behind pancreatic neck to form portal vein  body: main part; lies to left of SMA, SMV anterior surface is covered with peritoneum forming the posterior surface of the omental bursa (lesser sac) splenic vein lies in groove on posterior surface of body   tail: lies between layers of the splenorenal ligament in the splenic hilum Pancreatic juice is secreted into a branching system of pancreatic ducts that extend throughout the gland. In the majority of individuals, the main pancreatic duct empties into the second part of duodenum at the ampulla of Vater.See article: pancreatic ducts for more information. Relations: posterior L2 vertebral body right kidney hilum, portal vein and IVC behind head  common bile duct grooves posterior surface of upper part of head close to duodenum aorta behind neck and uncinate process  left kidney hilum, left suprarenal gland and right crus behind body  splenic vein joined by inferior mesenteric vein, and confluence of splenic vein and superior mesenteric vein to form portal vein   anterior lesser sac separating it from stomach lesser omentum and liver through it above the lesser curvature  attachment of transverse mesocolon across head and lower margin of neck and body  D1 duodenum anterior to (or above) head of pancreas  infracolic compartment in front of lower part of head, neck and body   superior origin of celiac trunk common hepatic artery runs to the right across upper margin of head and neck splenic artery runs to the left across upper margin of body     Arterial supplyArterial supply to the head is primarily from the inferior and superior pancreaticoduodenal arteries. Branches of the splenic artery supply the neck, body and tail via multiple branches including the dorsal pancreatic artery, greater pancreatic artery (arteria pancreatica magna) and transverse pancreatic artery.Venous return is by numerous small veins into the splenic hilum. From the head the superior pancreaticoduodenal vein drains into the portal vein and the inferior pancreaticoduodenal vein drains into the superior mesenteric vein. Variant anatomyAnnular pancreas An annular pancreas is an uncommon (~1 in 20,000 1) variation with partial or complete surrounding of the duodenum with pancreatic tissue. The ventral pancreatic anlage is responsible for this anomaly by dividing early into two segments: often detected incidentally in asymptomatic patients may be associated with duodenal stenosis, postbulbar ulcerations, pancreatitis or biliary obstruction Bifid pancreasRare branching anomaly of the pancreas tail and its duct system, also known as fishtail pancreas 6.Ectopic pancreatic tissueEctopic pancreatic tissue refers to pancreatic rests that lie outside and separate to the pancreatic gland. It is reportedly quite common, affecting ~5% (range 1-10%) 1 of people, most of whom are completely asymptomatic.Recognized locations for ectopic pancreatic tissue include the gastric antrum, proximal duodenum, ileum and Meckel diverticula.Pancreatic cleftsLinear clefts may be seen which contain fat where small vessels enter the pancreas and are a common mimic of pancreatic laceration.

__label__Hepatobiliary Pancreas divisum represents a variation in pancreatic ductal anatomy that can be associated with abdominal pain and idiopathic pancreatitis. It is characterized, in the majority of cases, by the dorsal pancreatic duct (main pancreatic and Santorini ducts) directly entering the minor papilla with no communication with the ventral duct (Wirsung), and thus, the major papilla. On this page:  Article: Terminology Epidemiology Clinical presentation Pathology Radiographic features Treatment and prognosis Related articles References   Images:Cases and figures  TerminologyThe term dominant dorsal duct syndrome is sometimes used in the literature to reflect that the main pancreatic duct draining via the minor papilla does not always have the classical pancreas divisum anatomy 8. The classic description of pancreas divisum refers to the complete form but incomplete and reverse forms have also been described (see figures 2 to 4).EpidemiologyIt is the most common variation of pancreatic duct formation and may be present in ~4-10 % of the general population 3-4,6. Its MRCP prevalence is at around 9% with autopsy prevalence going up to 14% 7.Clinical presentationMost people with a pancreas divisum are asymptomatic, but this is more frequently found in patients with chronic abdominal pain and idiopathic pancreatitis than in the general population 4.PathologyIt results from failure of fusion of dorsal and ventral pancreatic anlages. As a result, the dorsal pancreatic duct drains most of the pancreatic glandular parenchyma via the minor papilla. Although controversial, this variant is considered as a cause of pancreatitis. Pancreatic divisum can result in a santorinicoele, which is a cystic dilatation of the distal dorsal duct (Santorini duct), immediately proximal to the minor papilla.  Three subtypes are known:  type 1 (classic): no connection at all; occurs in the majority of cases: 70%   type 2 (absent ventral duct): minor papilla drains all of pancreas while major papilla drains bile duct; 20-25%   type 3 (functional): filamentous or inadequate connection between dorsal and ventral ducts: 5-6% A reverse pancreas divisum has been described where the main duct fuses with the ventral duct and a small residue dorsal duct does not communicate with the main duct and drains separately into the minor papilla 9, 10.Radiographic featuresFluoroscopy: ERCPThis was the traditional method of diagnosis where a pancreas divisum was suspected when there was no contrast extending towards the pancreatic tail upon administration at the ampulla of Vater.MRCP/MRI pancreasIt is the current gold standard method of evaluation. The key imaging features: the dorsal pancreatic duct being in direct continuity with the duct of Santorini, which drains into the minor ampulla ventral duct (Wirsung duct), which does not communicate with the dorsal duct but joins with the distal bile duct to enter the major ampulla Some authors suggest increased sensitivity of secretin MRCP (S-MRCP) in detection sensitivity of pancreas divisum 2.Treatment and prognosisA diagnosis of pancreas divisum does not routinely warrant treatment, especially when incidental and asymptomatic.  In symptomatic patients (e.g. recurrent pancreatitis), management options may include 6: non-operative treatment +/- pancreatic enzyme supplements minor papillectomy minor papilla stenting balloon dilatation of any associated stricture 
__label__Gastrointestinal A pancreas transplant is a procedure in which a donor pancreas is transplanted to a recipient. The donor pancreas is typically cadaveric, but may rarely be a segment from a living donor 1. The transplant is meant to establish normoglycemia in patients with diabetes mellitus, typically type 1, though similar outcomes may be achieved with patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus 2.The most common types of pancreas transplants are 3: SPK: simultaneous pancreas and kidney transplant (~78% of cases) PAK: pancreas after kidney transplant (~16% of cases) PTA: pancreas transplant alone (~7% of cases)  On this page:  Article: Indications Procedure Radiographic features Complications Outcomes Practical points Related articles References   IndicationsTransplants are typically performed in patients with diabetic complications or hyperlabile diabetes. To be a candidate for transplant, the risks and complications from the patient's diabetes must outweigh the risk from surgical complications and post procedure immunosuppression, which must be continued for life 4.Pancreas transplants may be performed for both type 1 and type 2 diabetes, although it is currently more commonly performed for type 1. Patients with type 1 diabetes often have absent or minimal serum levels of c-peptide (<1 mg/ml), and are considered better surgical candidates 5.Indications for pancreas transplant and simultaneous pancreas and kidney transplant are continually evolving. The American Diabetes Association 2006 indications for pancreas transplant are 4: hyperlabile diabetes defined by frequent acute severe metabolic complications (hypoglycemia, marked hyperglycemia, and ketoacidosis) requiring medical attention clinical and emotional problems with insulin therapy that are incapacitating consistent failure of insulin based management to prevent complications presence of (two or more) diabetic complications that are progressive and unresponsive to intensive insulin therapy early diabetic nephropathy proliferative retinopathy symptomatic peripheral or autonomic neuropathy vasculopathy with accelerated atherosclerosis  The indications for a pancreas and kidney transplant are: CKD stages 4 or 5 (creatinine clearance <30 ml/min) with type 1 diabetes and with other diabetic complications prior renal transplant which is failing in a type 1 diabetic ProcedureTechniqueThe pancreas is procured from the donor in a variety of ways, depending on the operative needs. The second portion of the duodenum (containing the ampulla of Vater) is recovered with the pancreas.The technique generally consists of 3: incision and exposure: intraperitoneal or retroperitoneal approaches possible donor portal vein mobilization: to confluence of splenic vein and superior mesenteric vein  arterial reconstruction, involving either: donor Y-graft: donor internal iliac artery is anastomosed end-to-end with the recipient external iliac artery  the other ends of the donor internal iliac artery bifurcation are anastomosed end-to-end with the donor pancreas superior mesenteric artery (SMA) and splenic artery  systemic venous drainage   direct splenic artery to SMA donor SMA is anastomosed to recipient external iliac artery donor splenic artery is anastomosed end-to-side with the donor SMA portal venous drainage     end-to-side or side-to-side anastomosis of the donor duodenal segment with recipient jejunum  Radiographic featuresUltrasoundUltrasound is considered the first-line modality in evaluating the transplanted pancreas and vasculature 3, demonstrating the following features: grayscale: transplant is hypoechoic relative to mesenteric fat useful to evaluate for peripancreatic fluid collections   color Doppler / power Doppler: evaluate flow to all parts of the transplant parenchyma evaluation of patency of arterial and venous anastomoses   spectral Doppler arterial waveforms: sharp upstroke with continuous diastolic flow venous waveforms: monophasic   Ultrasound may be limited by the presence of overlying bowel gas, which is common due to the frequent anastomosis to the small bowel.  One of the primary roles of ultrasound is to exclude thrombosis. Ultrasound has limited ability to diagnose rejection. Rejection and pancreatitis may appear similarly. CTCT is superior to ultrasound in cases of suspected abdominal infections, bowel complications, graft rejection, or pancreatitis 3.  It is typically performed with oral contrast.MRIGiven the common presence of contraindications to IV contrast material in donor recipients, MR is superior to CT in assessing vascular complications 3. ComplicationsVascular complications of a pancreas transplant are conceptually similar to a renal transplant, and include 3 graft rejection anastomotic breakdown and hemorrhage stenosis or thrombosis of the arterial inflow or venous outflow Bowel complications may also occur 3:  small bowel obstructionusually from adhesions, but internal hernia may occur  anastomotic exocrine leak colitis, specifically pseudomembranous and cytomegalovirus colitis  Other complications include 3: fluid collections, especially peripancreatic fluid collection  post-transplant lymphoproliferative/lymphoproliferation disorder (PTLP) Post-grafting pancreatitis is also possible.OutcomesUnadjusted patient survival rates 6: SPK: 1 year: 95-98% 3 years: 91-93% 5 years: 87% 10 years: 70%   PAK: 1 year: 95-98% 3 years: 91-93% 5 years: 84% 10 years: 65%   PTA: 1 year: 95-98% 3 years: 91-93% 5 years: 89% 10 years: 73%   SPK patients demonstrate the best pancreas graft survival rates.Practical pointsThe donor duodenum sometimes may not fill well with oral contrast and can simulate a perianastomotic fluid collection.

Most commonly it is associated with aging, obesity and end-stage chronic pancreatitis. It occurs principally with fatty replacement of the pancreas (pancreatic lipomatosis), and the etiology overlaps considerably. Lobular (lubulocentric) atrophy may be seen in pancreatic malignancies including adenocarcinoma, pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN) and IPMN 4,5,6.

Typically ductal adenocarcinomas appear as poorly defined masses with extensive surrounding desmoplastic reaction. They enhance poorly compared to adjacent normal pancreatic tissue and thus appear hypodense on arterial phase scans in 75-90% of cases, but may become isodense on delayed scans 1 (thus the need for multiple phase scanning when pancreatic cancer is the clinical question). Double duct sign may be seen.CT correlates well with surgical findings in predicting unresectability (positive predictive value of 89-100% 3). The most important feature to assess locally is the relationship of the tumor to surrounding vessels (SMA and celiac axis). If the tumor surrounds a vessel by more than 180 degrees, then it is deemed T4 disease and is unresectable 3.MRISignal characteristics include:  T1: hypointense cf. normal pancreas 5   T1 FS: hypointense cf. normal pancreas 5   T1 + C (Gd): slower enhancement than the normal pancreas, therefore dynamic injection with fat saturation with arterial phase imaging is ideal  T2/FLAIR: variable (therefore not very useful), depending on the amount of reactive desmoplastic reaction 1,5   MRCP: double duct sign may be seen Treatment and prognosisMost tumors are not resectable at diagnosis.Surgery for stage I and II (see staging of pancreatic cancer) does offer the chance of cure, though with high morbidity (20-30%) and mortality (5%) 3. Resection is performed with a Whipple operation.Even when resection is possible, the majority of patients succumb to recurrence, with only a doubling of survival in operated patients 1, from 5% to 10% at 5 years 4.

__label__Gastrointestinal __label__Oncology __label__Hepatobiliary Staging of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma is traditionally done according to American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) / Union for International Cancer Control (IUCC) TNM system.  In 2017 new edition (8th edition) AJCC published with some major changes; now exocrine and endocrine tumors of the pancreas are staged using different staging systems. The following is for staging of adenocarcinoma of the pancreas. In the 8th edition of AJCC,  T staging has become more size-based rather than descriptive-based, resectability has been omitted from T4 category, and the number not just the presence of the regional lymph nodes defining the N stage of disease 1,3. As a majority of tumors are non-resectable, staging is mostly achieved with imaging, although laparoscopy is often required to confirm resectability. CT is the preferred modality for assessing resectability 2.Primary tumor staging (T)  Tx, T0, Tis: see TNM system   T1: tumor ≤ 2 cm in greatest dimension  T2: tumor >2 cm in greatest dimension but less than ≤ 4 cm  T3: tumor >4 cm in greatest dimension  T4: involvement of SMA or celiac axis Regional lymph nodes (N)  Nx: nodes cannot be assessed  N0: no evidence of nodal involvement  N1: 1-3 regional node metastases present  N2: 4 or more regional node metastases present Metastases (M)  Mx: presence of metastases cannot be assessed  M0: no evidence of metastases  M1: distant metastases present Stage groupings  stage 0:   Tis N0 M0  stage Ia:  T1 N0 M0  stage Ib:  T2 N0 M0  stage IIa:  T3 N0 M0  stage IIb:  T1, T2 or T3 with N1 M0  stage III:  any T N2 M0, or T4 any N  stage IV:  M1 (any T any N) 
__label__Hepatobiliary The diameter of the (main) pancreatic duct is a commonly assessed parameter in imaging.Gross anatomyThe duct diameter is greatest at the head and neck region and is slightly narrower towards the body and tail. Its normal reported value ranges between 1-3.5 mm 5,8: head: 3.5 mm body: 2.5 mm tail: 1.5 mm The diameter of duct can increase with inspiration 3.Related pathologyAbnormal dilatation of the pancreatic duct indicates obstruction of the normal flow of pancreatic secretions due to a distal (i.e. downstream) tumor or stricture. This can occur with acute pancreatitis, chronic pancreatitis or pancreatic neoplasms. Rarely, pancreatic duct dilatation can occur with tumoral hypersecretion of mucin (e.g. from intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms).Some authors suggest a main pancreatic duct dilatation (≥2.5 mm) without an obvious cause as an independent predictor of developing pancreatic cancer 6.
__label__Hepatobiliary __label__Gastrointestinal The ductal embryology of the pancreas is moderately complicated, leading to a number of anatomical variants of the pancreatic ducts, many of which are clinically significant. On this page:  Article: Gross anatomy Variant anatomy History and etymology Related articles References   Images:Cases and figures  Gross anatomyThe normal arrangement is for the entire pancreas to be drained via a single duct, to the ampulla of Vater through the sphincter of Oddi.Conventional pancreatic ductal anatomy is described below. Main pancreatic duct portion of the dorsal duct proximal to the dorsal-ventral fusion point drains at the ampulla of Vater connects with the accessory pancreatic duct (of Santorini) (see below) if present Nomenclature of the main pancreatic duct can be confusing 10-12: based on distance from pancreatic head: proximal (head region); distal (tail region) based on direction of secretion flow: proximal (tail region); distal (head region) it may be best to refer to duct location by region, e.g. "duct in the head region" to avoid confusion Pancreatic duct of Wirsung distal portion of the main pancreatic duct segment of the ventral duct between the dorsal-ventral fusion point and the major papilla continuous with the main pancreatic duct proximally Accessory pancreatic duct (of Santorini or Bernard) portion of the dorsal duct distal to the dorsal-ventral fusion point  drains anterior and superior portion of the head in 70% of individuals drains to the minor papilla in 30% of individuals persists as a branch of the main pancreatic duct   Variant anatomyVariants of the pancreas which result in ductal variations are covered in the pancreas article. Pancreas divisumA pancreas divisum is the most common variation of pancreatic duct formation and can account for up to 14% 3. It results from the failure of fusion of dorsal and ventral pancreatic anlages. As a result, the dorsal pancreatic duct drains most of the pancreatic glandular parenchyma via the minor papilla. Although controversial, this variant is considered as a cause of pancreatitis 1,3. Pancreatic divisum can result in a santorinicele 2, which is a cystic dilatation of the distal dorsal duct, immediately proximal to the minor papilla . Three subtypes are known 5:  type 1: classic, no connection at all; occurs in the majority of cases (~70%)  type 2: absent ventral duct, minor papilla drain all of pancreas while major papilla drains bile duct (~25%)  type 3: functional, filamentous or inadequate connection between dorsal and ventral ducts (~5%) Meandering main pancreatic ductMeandering main pancreatic duct (MMPD) comprises of a reverse Z-type and loop-type of pancreatic ducts.Ansa pancreaticaAnsa pancreatica is a rare anatomic variation of the pancreatic ducts. It is a communication between the main pancreatic duct and the accessory pancreatic duct.Anomalous pancreaticobiliary junctionAnomalous pancreaticobiliary junction refers to the union of the pancreatic duct and common bile duct outside the duodenal wall. History and etymologyThe duct of Wirsung was first reported in an etching by Johann Georg Wirsung (1589-1643), a German-Italian anatomist 8.  The accessory pancreatic duct of Santorini is named after Giovanni Domenico Santorini (1681-1737), an Italian professor of medicine 8. 
__label__Gastrointestinal Pancreatic intraductal tubulopapillary neoplasms (ITPNs) are rare variants of intraductal papillary neoplasms. Unlike an IPMN, an ITPN does not produce mucin.

__label__Gastrointestinal __label__Hepatobiliary Pancreatic lipomatosis refers to fat accumulation in the pancreatic parenchyma. This finding is most often associated with obesity and aging. It tends to be the commonest pathological condition involving the pancreas.

__label__Gastrointestinal __label__Vascular The pancreaticoduodenal veins accompany their corresponding arteries and act to drain the head of the pancreas and duodenum.Gross anatomyThere are four small pancreaticoduodenal veins: posterior superior pancreaticoduodenal vein anterior superior pancreaticoduodenal vein posterior inferior pancreaticoduodenal vein anterior inferior pancreaticoduodenal vein They drain the head of the pancreas and the second and third parts of the duodenum.LocationThe pancreaticoduodenal veins lie on the surface of the pancreas and form anterior and posterior arcades via anastomoses between the inferior and superior veins. Duodenal branches extend inferiorly and to the right of the head of the pancreas. The superior veins are generally larger than the inferior veins and drain a greater portion of the pancreatic head 1.CourseThe posterior superior pancreaticoduodenal vein runs through the posterior pancreaticoduodenal sulcus and drains into the right posterior wall of the portal vein 2.The anterior superior pancreaticoduodenal vein runs a horizontal course across the anterior aspect of the pancreatic head before draining into the gastrocolic trunk or the right gastroepiploic vein 1. Both of these subsequently drain into the superior mesenteric vein.   The anterior and posterior inferior pancreaticoduodenal veins drain a smaller portion of the pancreatic head, often only the uncinate process. They pass horizontally to the left and drain into the first jejunal vein or directly into the superior mesenteric vein at the caudal margin of the pancreas 3.Related pathologyduodenal varices
__label__Chest __label__Gastrointestinal __label__Hepatobiliary Pancreaticopleural fistulae are a rare complication of acute or chronic pancreatitis whereby enzymatic pancreatic fluid, either from a pancreatic pseudocyst or directly from a disrupted duct, dissects into the pleural cavity. Pancreaticopleural fistulas may also develop in the setting of trauma or iatrogenic pancreatic duct disruption. On this page:  Article: Epidemiology Clinical presentation Pathology Radiographic features Treatment and prognosis Related articles References   Images:Cases and figures  EpidemiologyPancreaticopleural fistulas are seen in ~5% (range 3-7%) of pancreatitis patients. They most often occur in middle-aged men with a history of chronic alcoholism 1-3, although biliary duct obstruction is a more common etiology in children 3.It is a rare cause (<1%) of pleural effusion 3. Fistula-associated pleural effusions are more common on the left side (~75% of cases) 1.Clinical presentationThe most common presentation is that of recurrent large pleural effusion in the setting of acute or chronic pancreatitis. Patients classically complain of thoracic symptoms (especially dyspnea) moreso than abdominal pain 1,3.The major described complication is infection of the pleural space and/or lung, resulting from a persistent fistulous communication with the gastrointestinal tract 1.PathologyDue to its enzymatic property, exocrine pancreatic secretions can dissect through fascial planes and communicating into adjacent tissue compartments. For example, dissection anteriorly leads to peritoneal communication, while dissection posteriorly leads to retroperitoneal communication. Pancreaticopleural fistulas are thought to develop from rupture of a pancreatic collection or pseudocyst into the pleural space either via the aortic/oesophgeal hiatus or through the diaphragmatic muscle itself 1-3. Pseudocysts both anterior and posterior to the pancreas can result in pancreaticopleural fistula 2.Some fistulas may occur secondary to direct pancreatic duct leak 3.Radiographic featuresThe sensitivity of various imaging modalities to delineate the track is variable 2: CT: 47%  ERCP: 78%  MRCP: 80% CTCT can delineate the fistula track, but moreso depicts changes of pancreatitis. CT shows a hypodense fistulous track from the pancreatic duct, ascending upwards crossing the diaphragm through to the pleural cavity causing pleural effusion.MRIMRCP is the imaging modality of choice because it helps to diagnose the presence and site of fistula and to guide further management. Unlike ERCP, it is non-invasive and helps in visualization of the pancreatic duct beyond strictures. Like CT, it can also show changes in pancreatic parenchyma 4.Treatment and prognosisManagement of non-healing fistula may require endoscopic or (if necessary) surgical repair. Although endoscopic intervention is often the first-line approach for management, patients may eventually require surgery to address persistent communication.In general, if the pancreatic duct is normal or mildly dilated and there are no strictures proximal to the site of the leak, pleural drainage (e.g. thoracocentesis) with somatostatin analogs may permit healing and resolution.Pancreatic duct disruption within the pancreatic head/body with stricture distal to the disruption may be addressed by ERCP-guided stent placement. However, pancreatic duct disruption with obstruction proximal to leak may require pancreatic resection or surgical enteropancreatic anastomosis 3.

Presentations attributable to a pseudocyst include: mass effect biliary obstruction gastric outlet obstruction   secondary infection PathologyPseudocysts occur from disruption of pancreatic duct structure with resulting leakage and accumulation of pancreatic juice resulting in hemorrhagic fat necrosis. They are not lined by epithelium (thus, “pseudocysts”), rather a severe inflammatory reaction results in encapsulation of the cyst by fibrosed granulation tissue. This usually takes 4-6 weeks 8,9. In approximately 50% of cases the cyst retains a communication with the pancreatic duct 2. Such cysts are more problematic to treat, and are more likely to recur.Etiology  acute or chronic pancreatitis (most common) pancreatic trauma iatrogenic, e.g. post partial gastrectomy 12  Radiographic featuresPseudocysts are fluid-filled oval or round collections with a relatively thick wall.

It is due to bilateral involvement of parotid and lacrimal glands in sarcoidosis, superimposed on the normal uptake in the nasopharyngeal mucosa.The presence of perihilar adenopathy adds the lambda distribution of increased uptake in the chest, which at times has been included in the description of the panda distribution.The panda sign is not specific for sarcoidosis, although it is one of few disorders that affect the salivary and lacrimal glands symmetrically.Since Ga-67 citrate accumulates in areas of inflammation and malignancy, the differential diagnosis for the symmetric bilateral accumulation in the lacrimal and salivary glands include lymphoma (after irradiation), Sjögren syndrome and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome.Radiographic featuresWhen the normal accumulation of the radionuclide in the nasopharynx is combined with increased symmetric accumulation in the parotid and lacrimal glands, the image shows a striking similarity to the mottled coloring of the giant panda.

__label__Chest Panlobular emphysema is a morphological descriptive type of emphysema that is depicted by permanent destruction of the entire acinus distal to the respiratory bronchioles with no "obvious" associated fibrosis.PathologyPanacinar emphysema is characterized by permanent destruction of the airspaces (alveoli) distal to the respiratory bronchioles. The pathogenesis relates to an intrinsic imbalance in the activity of protease/elastase released and an inhibitor of protease - alpha-1 antitrypsin.Microscopically emphysema is depicted by abnormally enlarged alveoli with floating alveolar septa but as the disease progress the lung parenchyma are further destroyed and intervening alveoli walls become harder to find. The term "panlobular" refers to the involvement of the entire acinus in contrast to the centrilobular distribution in a smoker. Macroscopically panlobular emphysema affects the lower lobes more severely.Two distinct patterns have been described 2: localized form: multilobular distribution diffuse form: distribution not related to the zonal anatomy of the lung Panlobular emphysema can either involve the entire lung in a rather homogeneous manner, or it may show lower lobe predominance 4.Etiology  alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency: classical cause and may show a lower zone predominance Ritalin lung  Swyer-James syndrome: affects one lung  obliterative bronchiolitis 3  can also manifest as a normal senescent finding in non-smokers 3  Radiographic featuresCTThe entire lung appears darker with attenuation of bronchovascular markings.

__label__Central __label__Nervous __label__System The Papez circuit is a fundamental component of the limbic system. It is a closed neural circuitry that starts and ends in the hippocampus. It is also known as the medial limbic circuit. On this page:  Article: Gross anatomy Radiographic features History and etymology Related articles References   Gross anatomyThe Papez circuit involves different structures of the brain including 2: hippocampus and adjacent cortex (entorhinal cortex) fornix mammillary bodies anterior nucleus of the thalamus  cingulum PathwayInformation from cortical association areas passes to the hippocampus via the cingulate gyrus, cingulum and parahippocampal gyrus. After information processing in the hippocampus, signals are transferred to the hypothalamus (mammillary body) via the fornix. Completion of the circuit and feedback to the cortex is accomplished through mammillothalamic fibers, relaying information from the hypothalamus to the anterior nucleus of the thalamus. The anterior nucleus of the thalamus projects fibers to the cingulate gyrus, cingulum and parahippocampal gyrus back to the hippocampus.In a more succinct format 2:Hippocampus → fornix → mammillary body → mammillothalamic fibers→ thalamus (anterior nucleus) → cingulum→ entorhinal cortex → hippocampal formation. Radiographic featuresMRI and DTI (diffusion tensor imaging)The pathway described above can be imaged using MRI and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in particular.History and etymologyIn 1930, James Papez suggested that the cognitive activity in the cortex affects the expression of emotions through connections to the hypothalamus and hippocampus. In Papez’s proposal, the hypothalamus regulates the autonomic nervous system activity during the expressions of emotions. Subsequently Paul MacLean modified Papez’s proposal to include the basal forebrain, amygdala and prefrontal cortex, and named it the limbic system. Recent studies show that Papez circuit has a more significant role in memory functions than in emotions 1,2.

They typically present in postmenopausal patients with the mean age at being ~63-67 years.Clinical presentationA papillary carcinoma may manifest clinically as a palpable mass or nipple discharge, with the latter present in 22-34% of patientsPathologyPapillary carcinomas may be solitary or multiple. When the epithelium of a papillary carcinoma has features diagnostic of intraductal carcinoma, the lesion is classified as papillary ductal carcinoma in situ. If a cystic component is present, the tumor is described as an intracystic papillary carcinoma (ICPC). In the absence of an appreciable cyst, a diagnosis of solid papillary carcinoma is appropriate. Invasive elements arising in a papillary carcinoma are almost always detected at the periphery of the lesion. Papillary carcinomas are usually well circumscribed and often contain hemorrhagic and cystic areas.Histologically it is characterized by a frondlike growth pattern on a fibrovascular core lacking a myoepithelial layer.Pathologically, four potential cellular patterns exist: cribriform compact columnar epithelial stratified spindle cell transitional form: similar to urothelial tumors Combinations of these patterns may be seen.LocationApproximately 50% of papillary carcinomas arise in the retro-areolar/subareolar region of the breast.Radiographic featuresMammographyThe most common mammographic pattern of invasive papillary carcinoma is a round, oval or lobulated mass. The mass margins are usually circumscribed but may be obscured or indistinct. Accompanying microcalcifications or a dilated ductal pattern may also be present.Breast ultrasoundSonographic evaluation of invasive papillary carcinomas may reveal a hypoechoic and solid mass, often with posterior acoustic enhancement; alternatively, complex cystic and solid masses may be evident. As they are relatively vascular, there are often color flow components on Doppler interrogation.There is overlap in the imaging patterns of invasive papillary carcinoma and papillary ductal carcinoma in situ. Galactography: ductographyFor patients presenting with nipple discharge, galactography may be helpful. Like intraductal papillomas, papillary carcinomas may be evident as ductal obstruction, filling defects, or focal or diffuse ductal wall irregularity.Breast MRIIn the case of an intracystic papillary carcinoma, it usually appears as a round or oval mass with well-defined margins. The internal composition is typically heterogeneous, with multiple nodular masses of intermediate signal intensity projecting from the periphery into the lumen. The signal intensity also dependent on the intracystic fluid composition: If serous, it will have low signal intensity on T1-weighted images and high signal intensity on T2-weighted images if there are hemorrhagic contents, it will be hyperintense on both T1- and T2-weighted images and fluid-fluid levels may be seen on T2-weighted images. Intracystic hemorrhage is a characteristic common finding at pathologic examination of papillary carcinomas. Contrast-enhanced MR imaging may show marked enhancement of the cyst walls, septa, and mural nodules 5.Treatment and prognosisThe overall prognosis is better than for commoner types of breast malignancy such as invasive ductal carcinoma not otherwise specified (NOS).

Both mucinous and non-mucinous adenocarcinomas typically consist of a mixture of histologic patterns, but reporting of the predominant subtype (lepidic, acinar, papillary, micropapillary, or solid growth) is specifically recommended for non-mucinous lesions, with all mucinous tumors placed in a separate category.EpidemiologyIt may account for 7-12% of all lung adenocarcinomas. There may be predilection in female non-smokers 1.PathologyIt this form papillary structures replace the underlying alveolar architecture. True papillary adenocarcinoma is usually diagnosed when the pathological features constitute >75% of the tumor on histopathology.Radiographic featuresCT Variable appearances have been described ranging from a solitary pulmonary nodule, as a mass containing internal bubble lucencies with surrounding ground-glass opacity and satellite micronodules or as a triangular mass with satellite micronodules 2.Treatment and prognosisThe presence of a micropapillary component in papillary carcinoma has been associated with early lymph node metastasis, intrapulmonary metastasis and a significantly lower 5-year survival rate 1.
__label__Hepatobiliary The papillary process of the caudate lobe, also known as the medial papillary process, represents a division of the inferior caudate lobe of the liver 1. The inferior aspect of the caudate may be divided into medial and lateral processes.  While the lateral or caudate process is contiguous with the right liver lobe, the medial or papillary process extends leftward and towards the stomach 1,3.There is variable morphology of the inferior caudate lobe. Often, a sagittally-oriented inferior fissure or groove separates the lateral caudate and medial papillary processes. The papillary process itself may extend anteriorly or inferiorly to protrude into the superior recess of the lesser sac 3.It is important to remain cognizant of the papillary process of the caudate on cross-sectional imaging, as it can often be mistakenly interpreted. Due to its leftward projection and (variable) fissure separation from the medial process, the papillary process usually appears discontinuous from the rest of the liver on at least one axial CT slice. Thus it can be mistaken for a lymphadenopathy or a pancreatic body mass, particularly when congenitally hypertrophied (variant anatomy) or enlarged from cirrhosis 1,3. The papillary process can be confidently identified on the basis of contiguity with the rest of the caudate lobe.
__label__Urogenital Papillary renal cell carcinomas (pRCC) are the second most common histological subtype of renal cell carcinoma. On this page:  Article: Epidemiology Clinical presentation Pathology Radiographic features See also References   Images:Cases and figures  EpidemiologyThis subtype may account 13-20% of all renal cell cancer 1. There is slightly increased male predilection.Clinical presentationAs with other types of renal cell cancer, most are asymptomatic and incidentally discovered.PathologyThere are two subtypes described according to morphology 7:  type I have papillae covered by a single layer of cuboidal or low columnar cells with scanty cytoplasm and low-grade nuclei carry a better prognosis than type II tumors    type II: are of a higher nuclear grade and contain more than one layer of cells with abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm although mostly unilateral, this subtype is considered the most common to result in bilateral renal cell cancers 1    While it has been described to have a tendency to present at a lower stage, it still has a distinct potential for progression and aggressive behavior 4.Associations hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell carcinoma hereditary papillary renal cell cancer type 1 Radiographic featuresAlthough there is no absolute rule, in general, papillary renal cancers at diagnosis tend to have a smaller mean diameter and be at a lower stage. The imaging features of type 1 and type 2 tumors may overlap.UltrasoundGenerally tends to be hypoechoic on ultrasound 9.CTSmaller lesions tend to be homogeneous is attenuation with larger tumors tending to be heterogeneous.These tumors are characteristically less vascularized than the more common clear cell subtype, showing overall hypoenhancement compared to the adjacent normal renal cortex, particularly seen in the corticomedullary phase.When not enhancing at all, it can be difficult to differentiate from hyper-attenuating cysts 8. MRIThe tumors generally present with a pseudo-capsule.   T1: hypointense  T2: hypointense  T1 C+ (Gd): contrast enhancement tends to be less intense than in the more common clear cell RCC subtype  DWI: restricted diffusion may be useful for differentiating from a hemorrhagic cyst See alsoWHO classification of tumors of the kidney
__label__Gynaecology A papillary serous carcinoma of the cervix (PSCC) is an uncommon histological type of cervical cancer. It is considered a sub type of adenocarcinoma of the cervix.  On this page:  Article: Epidemiology Pathology Treatment and prognosis See also References   EpidemiologyAccodring to some studies, there was a bimodal age distribution, with one peak occurring before the age of 40 years and the second peak after the age of 65 1.PathologyPapillary serous adenocarcinoma of the cervix resembles microscopically its counterparts elsewhere in the female genital tract and peritoneum. MarkersPSCC may give a significantly higher p53 and lower CEA reactivity than other more common histologic subtypes 5StagingStaging is same other cervical tumors - see - cervical cancer stagingTreatment and prognosisThese tumors can behave aggressively with supradiaphragmatic metastases and a rapidly fatal course when diagnosed at an advanced stage, but the outcome for patients with stage I tumors is similar to that of patients with cervical adenocarcinomas of the usual type 1. The following factors have been associated with a poorer prognosis 1 age <65 years at diagnosis stage > I tumor size > 2 cm tumor invasion > 10 mm presence of lymph node metastases elevation of serum CA-125 In contrast to ovarian, tubal, and endometrial serous carcinomas, local therapy appears to be effective treatment for many serous carcinomas of the cervix 2.See alsoWHO histological classification of tumors of the uterine cervix
__label__Gynaecology Papillary serous carcinoma of the endometrium is an uncommon histological subtype of endometrial carcinoma accounting for only 5-10% of all such tumors 2. It is considered type II endometrial adenocarcinoma and has a clinically aggressive form with an early extension of the tumor via Fallopian tubes into the peritoneum and peritoneal seeding which accounts for its poorer prognosis compared to the other adenocarcinomas of the uterus. This is thought to closely resemble ovarian papillary serous carcinoma 1.PathologyLike is ovarian counterpart papillary projections characterize it and frequently contains psammoma bodies (may be found in ~1/3 of cases) that may calcify 2. MarkersThis subtype may increase serum CA-125 levels 2.

__label__Oncology __label__Head __label__& __label__Neck Papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) is the most common malignancy of the thyroid gland and frequently has nodal metastases at presentation. On this page:  Article: Terminology Epidemiology Clinical presentation Pathology Radiographic features Treatment and prognosis Differential diagnosis Related articles References   Images: Cases and figures Imaging differential diagnosis   TerminologyWhen the tumor measures <1 cm, the term micropapillary carcinoma (mPTC) is used 14. EpidemiologyPapillary thyroid cancer (as is the case with follicular thyroid cancer) typically occurs in the middle-aged, with a peak incidence in the 3rd and 4th decades. It is more common in women with an M:F ratio of 1:2.5 (range 1:1.6-3:1) 2.It accounts for the majority (~70%) of all thyroid neoplasms and 85% of all thyroid cancers 2,4. There are 45,000 cases in the United States every year and this type of carcinoma has the fastest increasing incidence of any malignancy in the thyroid. Those at risk include family history and previous head/neck radiation.Clinical presentationPresentation is usually with a solitary palpable thyroid mass.Papillary carcinoma has a tendency to metastasize early to local lymph nodes, with 50% (39-90% 2) of patients having nodal involvement at presentation 1 (c.f. 10% for follicular thyroid cancer). These metastases are usually to the ipsilateral jugular chain (87.8%) and are usually confined to the mid and lower lymph node levels, level III and IV (73.2%) 1.In ~20% of patients, lymph node metastases are the first presentation. In 50% of children and 20% of adults a cervical lymph node is palpable at the time of diagnosis 4.Distal haematogenous dissemination is less common than with follicular cancer, with a prevalence of only in 5-10% of patients at presentation.PathologyLymphatic spread is more common than haematogenous spread (c.f. follicular thyroid carcinoma) and multifocality is common.HistologyHistologically papillary carcinoma demonstrates 'delicate stalks of epithelial cells' 3 which account for its name. Cells have characteristic Orphan Annie eye nuclear inclusions, and psammoma bodies are common.VariantsSeveral variants have been described according to biological behavior 13 aggressive tall cell variant columnar cell variant hobnail variant   less favourable solid variant diffuse sclerosing variant   favourable follicular variant / encapsulated variant cribriform variant / morula variant Warthin like variant   Associations Gardner syndrome Cowden syndrome  familial adenomatous polyposis: usually associated with the cribriform-morular variant Radiographic featuresImaging of the neck of a patient with papillary thyroid carcinoma involves both examination of the thyroid as well as careful assessment of the regional lymph nodes for the presence of metastases.UltrasoundPapillary carcinoma within the thyroid usually appears as a solitary mass usually with an irregular outline, located in the subcapsular region and demonstrating vascularity 6. Small punctate regions of echogenicity representing microcalcifications (psammoma bodies) may be present 5.Lymph node metastases have a tendency to completely cavitate (40%), and although usually multiple, in a minority of cases (6%) a single completely cystic node may be present 1. They tend to have septations, mural nodules and relatively thick walls 1.Fine needle aspirationAny thyroid nodule presents a diagnostic challenge as up to 50% of the general population will have thyroid nodules of some description on high-resolution thyroid ultrasound 9. There has previously been great variance in investigating thyroid nodules with some operators routinely aspirating thyroid lesions while others use traditional discriminators such as size in deciding whether or not to proceed to needle biopsy.Recent research in North America, Korea, and Europe has demonstrated that traditional discriminators are poor correlates for thyroid cancer, which is most commonly papillary. Guidelines have now been produced to broadly categorize nodules as benign, indeterminate, or suspicious for malignancy with a shift in focus to looking at ultrasound appearances rather than simply size.The U-classification system is an example proposed by the British Thyroid Association10.CTCT is best at staging lymph node involvement (see thyroid cancer staging). Involved lymph nodes tend to have 1: cystic components: ~35% thick nodular walls: ~40% septae: ~60% purely cystic nodes are uncommon and more frequent in young patients calcification may be seen occasionally the so-called lateral aberrant thyroid is actually a lymph node metastasis from papillary thyroid carcinoma MRIMRI, although probably more sensitive than CT, is nonetheless still far from perfect with a sensitivity of only 67% 2. This is largely a result of the fact that as many as half involved nodes found histologically following surgery, being less than 3 mm in diameter 2.As discussed above, nodes have a tendency to become cystic. The cystic component will have near-fluid attenuation. The solid metastatic component will appear 2:General signal characteristics include:  T1 hypointense to muscle enhancement is best seen with fat suppression    T2: variable 2 hypointense: 34% isointense: 45% hyperintense: 21%   Nuclear imagingPapillary thyroid cancer usually concentrates radioiodine, but not pertechnetate. FDG-PET FDG-avid incidental FDG-avid thyroid nodules have approximately 40% risk of being a primary thyroid malignancy 9.  Treatment and prognosisTreatment involves both surgical resection and administration of radioactive iodine for lymph node metastases.Overall papillary carcinoma carries a relatively good prognosis with a 20 year survival rate of approximately 90%. The 5 year survival is in the range of 95%.  If the tumor is confined to the gland then mortality is less than 2.5%, with a sharp increase in mortality in patients with extension beyond the gland, to 38% 2.There is a paucity of high quality data on the extent of surgery required (thyroid lobectomy versus total thyroidectomy) for low risk papillary thyroid cancer 12. A recent systematic review suggests that operative approach did not impact overall survival 12.Differential diagnosisOther thyroid neoplasms should be considered in the absence of cavitary cervical lymph nodes.The differential of a cystic neck mass(es) includes:  thyroglossal duct cyst (only if single)  branchial cleft cyst (only if single) cystic metastasis to the thyroid abscess including tuberculous lymphadenitis  multiple neurofibromas  
__label__Central __label__Nervous __label__System Papillary tumors of the pineal region (PTPR) are a relatively recently described entity, and considered one of four pineal parenchymal tumors under the current (2016) WHO classification of CNS tumors.  On this page:  Article: Epidemiology Clinical presentation Pathology Radiographic features Differential diagnosis Related articles References   EpidemiologyPapillary tumor of the pineal region are seen in a wide range of ages, reported from 1-70 years of age, with most cases found in middle age 3,4. They are encountered equally in both genders 3.   Clinical presentationAs with all other pineal region masses clinical presentation is mainly from obstructive hydrocephalus secondary to compression of the tectum of the midbrain and obstruction of the aqueduct. Compression of the superior colliculi can also lead to a characteristic gaze palsy, known as Parinaud syndrome.PathologyPapillary tumor of the pineal region are though to arise from specialized ependymocytes of the subcommissural organ located in the lining of the posterior commissure rather than from the pineal gland itself 1-3. It is also hypothesized that some, or perhaps many, previously published descriptions of unusual pineal region tumors (e.g. choroid plexus papillomas and papillary ependymomas) actually represent PTPRs, as histologically they are difficult to distinguish, requiring immunohistochemistry 1.These tumors are considered WHO grade II or III tumors 3.Macroscopic appearancePapillary tumor of the pineal region are macroscopically indistinguishable from pineocytomas, appearing as well circumscribed tumors of the pineal region 3.Microscopic appearancePapillary tumor of the pineal region demonstrate varible morphology ranging from solid to predominantly papillary, reminiscent of ependymomas, including the presence of ependymal rosettes 3. Areas of necrosis are sometimes identified 3,4.ImmunophenotypePTPRs have a fairly characteristic immunohistochemical profile that allows them to be distinguished from other pineal parenchymal tumors.  cytokeratins (AE1/3, CAM5.2, KL1, CK18): positive  S100: positive  vimentin: positive  tansthyretin: positive neuron-specific enolase: positive  MAP2: positive  GFAP: variable Radiographic featuresMRI Papillary tumors of the pineal region are often indistinguishable from pineocytomas.

This is a relatively specific findings when other causes of T1 shortening are excluded (e.g fat in a teratoma or lipoma, melanoma, hemorrhagic metastases) 1,3.Screening of the entire neural axis is required as CSF dissemination has been reported in up to 7% of cases 4. Differential diagnosisOn imaging consider other pineal region masses, particularly: pineocytoma and pineal parenchymal tumor of intermediate differentiation: indistinguishable from each other based only on imaging and immunohistochemistry tests are required
__label__Central __label__Nervous __label__System Papilledema is an ophthalmoscopic diagnosis and refers to swelling of the optic disc. The MRI appearance relates to the dural anatomy of the optic nerve, which is continuous with the subarachnoid space, thereby allowing increased intracranial pressure (ICP) to be transmitted to the optic disc. The causes are protean, a veritable Augean stable of conditions (see below), the most common of which would be an intracranial mass or collection. In most cases, the papilledema is bilateral, however can be unilateral in Foster Kennedy syndrome and its pseudovariants.Note however that with the advent of motion correction (e.g. BLADE) sequences, CSF in the dural sheath over the optic nerve is much more frequently seen, and caution should be shown when reporting this. Flattening or bulging of the optic nerve head, is probably a more specific sign.The differential is also broad for the fundoscopic findings, although most have quite different MRI appearances. These include: optic neuropathy malignant hypertension optic nerve papillitis optic nerve tumors Possible etiologies of papilledema intracranial masses primary CNS malignancies cerebral metastases   extra-axial collection subdural hemorrhages subdural hygromas subdural empyemas   meningeal disease meningioma(s) leptomeningeal carcinomatosis granulomatous conditions / infections tuberculosis neurosarcoidosis      idiopathic intracranial hypertension also known as pseudotumor cerebri progressive stenosis of the optic canals and compressive optic neuropathy - rare but can occur in certain skeletal dysplasias such as progressive diaphyseal dysplasia 4  Differential diagnosisPossible imaging differential considerations include: pseudopapilloedema: from drusen 2,3 See alsooptic nerve sheath diameter

__label__Vascular __label__Hepatobiliary Paracaval lipoma (juxtacaval fat collection or pseudolipoma of the inferior vena cava) can be a frequent finding on CT and can be seen in up to 0.5% of examinations 1. Some even consider this as a normal variation 5. It occurs at the medial aspect of the intrahepatic portion of the inferior vena cava (IVC) above the caudate lobe and represents pericaval fat appearing to invaginate into the inferior vena cava. This is thought to be due to volume averaging through inwards and upwards in-drawing of the posteromedial wall of the inferior vena cava as a result of negative pressure created within the thorax on inspiration 2.EpidemiologyAssociationsIt can be seen in patients with cirrhosis 4. Differential diagnosisOn imaging consider  bland thrombus in the inferior vena cava  tumor thrombus renal cell carcinoma (RCC) hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) adrenal carcinoma    tumors of the inferior vena cava, e.g. leiomyosarcoma 3  
__label__Central __label__Nervous __label__System The paracentral lobule is located on the medial surface of the cerebral hemisphere, and includes parts of both the frontal and parietal lobes. It is the medial continuation of the precentral and postcentral gyri. It has motor and sensory functions related to the lower limb. On this page:  Article: Gross anatomy Function Blood supply Variant anatomy Related articles References   Images:Cases and figures  Gross anatomyRelations and boundariesThe paracentral lobule is bounded anteriorly by the paracentral sulcus, which is usually an ascending branch of the cingulate sulcus. This sulcus separates the paracentral lobule from the medial frontal gyrus (the medial continuation of the superior frontal gyrus) and the supplementary motor area (the posterior part of the medial frontal gyrus) 1-4.Posteriorly, the paracentral lobule bounded by the pars marginalis; the ascending terminal extension of the cingulate sulcus, which separates the paracentral lobule from the precuneus1-4.The inferior boundary is the cingulate sulcus, which separates the paracentral lobule from the cingulate gyrus. The central sulcus extends into the posterosuperior aspect of the paracentral lobule in most cases, creating the division between the frontal lobe, anteriorly, and the parietal lobe, posteriorly1,4.It is important to note, that the medial continuation of the precentral sulcus (which is often interrupted), is not the anterior border of the paracentral lobule, as this is located posterior to the paracentral sulcus 3,4. As a result of this, the superior frontal gyrus extends further posteriorly than the medial frontal gyrus, and the paracentral lobule includes not just the medial continuation of the precentral and postcentral gyri, but also an additional gyrus anteriorly 3,4.  FunctionThe anterior two-thirds are part of the primary motor area controlling the leg, foot and urinary bladder. Blood supplyIt is supplied by branches of the anterior cerebral artery.Variant anatomyApproximately 95% of paracentral lobules are of continuous type. Continuous paracentral lobule describes incomplete separation of the precentral and postcentral gyri, such that they merge together. The remaining 5% are of segmented type , with complete separation of the precentral and postcentral gyri 2. In this latter type, an additional small gyrus, known as the lobulo-limbic transitional gyrus is found between the lower border of the paracentral lobule and cingulate gyrus 2.

__label__Cardiac __label__Paediatrics A parachute mitral valve is a valvular congenital abnormality usually identified in infants or young children, though it can present later, in adulthood.PathologyParachute mitral valves occur when all the chordae tendineae are attached to a single papillary muscle origin. Unlike the normal situation where there are two papillary muscles providing attachment to the two leaflets, this single origin means the valve has limited opening, thus causing a relative obstruction. When presenting in infancy, the condition usually progresses to mitral stenosis.AssociationsIt may occur as a single anomaly but is recognized as part of the Shone complex.Other recognized associations include: supravalvular mitral ring subaortic stenosis aortic coarctation See also mitral valve disease mitral valve

It is sometimes difficult to differentiate from honeycombing due to pulmonary fibrosis.
__label__Chest Paracoccidioidomycosis (PCM) is a systemic fungal infection endemic in South America that, although asymptomatic in most infected patients, may progress to debilitating symptomatic forms. The chronic disease commonly affects adult males and manifest with lung and mucocutaneous lesions. On this page:  Article: Epidemiology Clinical presentation Pathology Treatment and prognosis History and etymology   References   Images:Cases and figures  EpidemiologyPCM represents the most prevalent systemic mycosis in South America and, in particular, in Brazil, where it is estimated to affect about 10% of the population in the endemic regions, particularly in the rural areas 1. There is a strong male preference of the chronic symptomatic form, with a ratio of 13:1 1,2.Clinical presentationThe primary pulmonary infection is usually self-limited and subclinical, confirmed only by laboratory tests such a positive paracoccidin intradermal test 2.Only about ~2% of the infected patients will manifest the clinical forms 2. The clinical disease is divided into two main types: acute or juvenile type represents the most severe form, commonly affecting children, adolescents, and young adults, with a course of weeks or months involvement of the reticuloendothelial system, presenting with fever, weight loss, hepatosplenomegaly and lymphadenopathy bone marrow dysfunction and osteolytic lesions are less frequently present   chronic or adult type represents the majority of cases (>90%) and it usually results from the reactivation of a quiescent lung infection in adulthood the presentation is usually nonspecific and includes a cough, dyspnea, expectoration hemoptysis, weight loss, and fever. mucous oropharyngeal lesions characteristically prompt patients to seek medical attention. These range from bleeding gingivitis, loose of teeth, to painful granulomas involving the lips, tongue, gums, and palate. Granulomatous lesions may also involve the larynx and vocal chords   PathologyParacoccidioides brasiliensis is a thermally dimorphic fungus. Microscopically, it shows a characteristic yeastlike appearance with multiple peripheral budding resembling a pilot’s wheel, or, when only two buds around the mother cell, resembling a ‘Mickey Mouse’’ head 2. Staining is usually performed with methenamine–silver nitrate (Grocott-Gomori) or periodic acid–Schiff 1,2.PCM is acquired by the inhalation of the fungal conidia from free-living mycelial forms, which commonly leads to a self-limited lung infection inciting a predominantly granulomatous tissue reaction, which also shows a less prominent suppurative infiltrates 1,2. The vast majority of the infected patients will then remain asymptomatic throughout life. Years later, due to a not fully understood mechanism of loss of the immune balance, there is a reactivation of latent pulmonary foci formed during the primary infection and patients progress to the chronic clinic form. Extrapulmonary manifestations occur due to haematogenous spread from the primary pulmonary foci.  The strong male prevalence is explained by the presence of beta-estradiol membrane receptors in the P. brasiliensis, which inhibits the switch of forms from the conidia-mycelial propagules to the yeast form 2.  Postmenopausal women are no longer protected by this mechanism and may also present with the chronic clinical form of the disease.Treatment and prognosisP. brasiliensis is a very sensitive fungus and responds to a great range of antifungal drugs. Most mild and moderate clinical forms of PCM are managed with itraconazole or sulfamethoxazole plus trimethoprim and, the severe cases, with amphotericin B 2,3. History and etymology  The disease was first described by Adolpho Lutz (1855-1940), Brazilian physician, in 1908 2.

This may result in subfalcine and/or transtentorial herniation. It is often triggered by acute imbalance caused by CSF drainage or lumbar puncture.Clinical presentationMay range from asymptomatic or mono symptomatic state to acute neurological deterioration.Radiographic features Large craniectomy with marked concavity of the overlying skin flap, with findings of mass effect such as effacement of the superficial sulci and buckling of the grey-white matter. There may be paradoxical midline shift away from (contralateral to) the craniectomy.Treatment and prognosisThis is a neurosurgical emergency and necessitates immediate intervention to prevent permanent damage:  place patient in Trendelenburg position to increase intracranial pressure, with aim of correcting the improper balance between atmospheric and intracranial pressure correction of the underlying cause e.g. manipulating CSF drains, lumbar puncture sites consider cranioplasty   
__label__Vascular Paradoxical embolism is a clinical scenario in which an embolism arising in the venous system crosses into the arterial circulation where it causes tissue infarction. The most common clinically important site of embolization is the cerebral circulation. On this page:  Article: Epidemiology Clinical presentation Pathology Radiographic features Treatment and prognosis References   EpidemiologyThe prevalence of paradoxical embolism is likely under reported due to its difficulty to diagnose. It likely makes up a significant portion of cryptogenic strokes, that is strokes that has no identifiable cause. Cryptogenic strokes represent up to 45% of ischemic strokes. The presence of paradoxical embolism should be considered in these patients.Clinical presentationThe presentation of a paradoxical embolism depends on the area of resulting infarction. It is usually indistinguishable from other forms of embolization as the responsible shunts are generally asymptomatic and not diagnosed. Less commonly patient’s may have coexistent hypercoagulable state, deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism.PathologyThe common underlying pathology in paradoxical embolism in any right-to-left shunt. The emboli itself is usually a venous thromboembolus, however, emboli consisting of fat, air, amniotic fluid and tumor tissue have been reported.The main routes of paradoxical emboli include:  patent foramen ovale: most common iatrogenic communication (battle defect, Fontan conduit, Rashkind device) other congenital anomalies: atrial spetal defect, ventricular septal defect, unroofed coronary sinus  pulmonary arteriovenous malformation systemic to pulmonary venous shunts arterioarterial shunts (patent ductus arteriosus) or venovenous communications Radiographic featuresUsually only the resulting arterial occlusion is detected via imaging, which may include: stroke myocardial infarction peripheral infarct splenic infarct renal infarct mesenteric infarct Radiographic diagnosis of the responsible defect is dependent on the type.Treatment and prognosisTreatment can be medical with a combination of anticoagulant and/or antiplatelet therapy. In addition to this percutaneous (e.g. atrial septal occlusion device) or surgical correction of the underling routes of paradoxical embolism can be performed.
__label__Head __label__& __label__Neck Paradoxical middle turbinate is a rare developmental cause of nasal obstruction. It refers to an inferomedially curved middle turbinate edge with the concave surface facing the nasal septum and usually occurs bilaterally.EpidemiologyParadoxical middle turbinate is a rarely encountered anomaly and can be easily recognized in CT paranasal sinuses but can be overlooked on endoscopic examination 3.The prevalence reported by different authors may diverge because some of them consider any involved portion of the turbinate as paradoxical curvature, whereas others may consider this variation only in cases where the whole turbinate is unusually curved towards the opposite side 4.Another study indicated paradoxical middle turbinate represents 9% of total anatomical variations.Radiographic featuresThis anatomic variant alone can lead to significant narrowing of the middle nasal meatus and impede the normal drainage of paranasal sinuses due to ostiomeatal complex obstruction 2. When associated with a concha bullosa, it can potentially lead to nasal obstruction 2.

However, the incidence of postoperative internal hernias has been increasing recently. The two most common types, the left and right paraduodenal hernia involve small bowel herniating through a congenital opening in the mesenteries. These internal hernias may result in closed-loop bowel obstruction. On this page:  Article: Clinical presentation Pathology Radiographic features Related articles References   Images:Cases and figures  Clinical presentationThe patient typically presents with symptoms of small bowel obstruction: abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting.PathologyLeft paraduodenal hernia the more common of the two paraduodenal hernias (75%) small bowel herniates through the fossa of Landzert, a congenital failure of fusion of the descending colon mesentery to the peritoneum in the left upper quadrant Right paraduodenal hernia the less common of the two paraduodenal hernias (25%) small bowel herniates through the fossa of Waldeyer, a congenital failure of fusion of the ascending colon mesentery to the peritoneum in the right lower quadrant associated with small bowel malrotation Radiographic featuresThese hernias usually appear as a sac-like cluster of small bowel loops in an atypical presentation. A closed-loop obstruction may occur within these loops due to the hernia.However, it is not unusual for small bowel loops to cluster in an atypical position in normal patients.

On this page:  Article: Terminology Epidemiology Clinical presentation Pathology Radiographic features Treatment and prognosis History and etymology Differential diagnosis  Related articles References   Images: Cases and figures Imaging differential diagnosis   TerminologyThe following entities with which it shares clinicopathological features are unified by this term and should no longer be used 11,12: cystic dystrophy of heterotopic pancreas pancreatic hamartoma of duodenum myoadenomatosis duodenal wall cyst groove pancreatitis EpidemiologyThe epidemiology of paraduodenal pancreatitis is similar to that of run-of-the-mill chronic pancreatitis. This rare entity is predominantly seen in males with a history of alcohol abuse. Peak incidence is roughly 40-50 years old 11,12. Clinical presentationThe clinical presentation of paraduodenal pancreatitis is dominated by symptoms resulting from marked duodenal stenosis and impaired motility with patients presenting with nausea and vomiting. Symptoms comprise: recurrent episodes of upper abdominal pain and nausea, typically aggravated by fat or protein-rich meals weight loss from poor nourishment Possible signs include: slight elevation of serum markers pancreatic enzymes (amylase and lipase) cholestatic liver enzymes gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP)   usually unremarkable level of tumor markers, e.g.  carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) CA 19-9   Jaundice is a rare finding, despite the frequent involvement of the common bile duct in terms of tubular stenosis.PathologyThe pathogenesis of paraduodenal pancreatitis remains controversial.The hallmark of disease is the presence of scar tissue with fibrosis in the pancreaticoduodenal groove or in the groove and the superior portion of the pancreatic head (in the pure and segmental forms of the disease, respectively).The duodenum is always involved by a chronic inflammatory process, with scar tissue in the wall leading to fibrosis and various levels of stenosis.EtiologyParaduodenal pancreatitis has been suggested to occur via increased viscosity of the pancreatic juice caused by alcohol, thus predisposing to crystal formation and increased production of protein, resulting in stone formation. Impeding the minor papilla either pathoanatomically or functionally this process incapacitates exocrine pancreatic function.The presence of affected pancreatic elements in the duodenal wall leads to inflammatory injury of the descending (second) part of the duodenum in the pancreatic groove. Changes may be cystic and/or stenotic 11.12.Microscopic appearanceHistopathological features have been demonstrated to include 11,12: dilated pancreatic ducts duodenal wall pseudocysts granulation tissue containing fused macrophages of foreign-body type hyperplasia of Brunner glands  heterotopic pancreatic acinar tissue interspersed by dense myofibroblastic and neural proliferation involvement of the pancreaticoduodenal groove by fibrotic inflammatory changes  Radiographic featuresParaduodenal pancreatitis is usually classified into two forms, pure and segmental:  pure form: affects exclusively the groove  segmental form: extends to the pancreatic head despite a clear predominance in the groove UltrasoundTransabdominal ultrasoundMay demonstrate 5,11: thickening of the second part of the duodenum possibly in continuity to a hypoechoic mass near the pancreatic head additional findings reflecting the background pathologic processes chronic calcific pancreatitis mild to moderate dilatation of pancreatic duct and common bile duct dilatation, possibly mimicking the "double duct sign"   Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS)May be preferred over transabdominal imaging as it more readily demonstrates the expected pathological changes comprising of: circumscript hypoechoic change between the duodenal wall and the pancreatic parenchyma thickening of duodenal wall and associated stenosis pancreatic calcifications and pseudocysts  stenotic changes of the common bile duct dilatation of the pancreatic duct EUS may also allow for guided needle tissue samples 11. CTMay depict pathological changes accurately. The following findings have been described in the literature: cystic thickening of the duodenal wall with or without duodenal stenosis fibrous tissue within the pancreaticoduodenal groove (may show late enhancement after contrast administration)  common bile duct dilatation MRIThe most characteristic finding on MRI is a sheetlike mass between the head of the pancreas and the duodenum 4.Signal characteristics include:  T1: hypointense to pancreatic parenchyma  T2: hypo-, iso-, or slightly hyper-intense Associated findings include: inflammatory changes of the pancreas duodenal stenosis local cysts regular tapering of the pancreatic and common bile ducts widening of the space between the distal pancreatic and common bile ducts, and duodenal lumen at MRCP 10  banana-shaped gallbladder 10  Treatment and prognosisConservative treatment options include analgesics, pancreatic rest and abstinence from alcohol. Symptom relief by these measures is frequently not permanent, as they are unable to stop the underlying background pathologic changes.Organ-sparing surgery with modified Whipple procedure as either pylorus-preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy or Frey procedure have been demonstrated to result in good and lasting pain relief together with improvement in quality of life 14,15.History and etymologyIt was first described by V Becker (German physician) in 1973 3.The term “groove pancreatitis” appeared later, coined in 1982 by Stolte et al, members of Becker's group. It is the direct translation of the original term "Rinnenpankreatitis". Differentiation between "pure groove pancreatitis" and "segmental groove pancreatitis" is the achievement of these Becker group members as well 16. “pure groove pancreatitis”: scarring limited to the groove area and “segmental groove pancreatitis,”  involvement of the pancreatic head Differential diagnosis   pancreatic adenocarcinoma of the head of the pancreas is the most relevant differential diagnosis of paraduodenal pancreatitis (particularly in its segmental form).

The largest cluster of cells is found within the adrenal medulla, with smaller collections in the paravertebral space, and head and neck region. Tumor arising in the paraganglia are called paragangliomas. They are classified by both location and secretory function. Clinical presentationSympathetic paragangliomas present with features of catecholamine-excess, such as headaches, palpitations, diaphoresis and hypertension. Whereas, parasympathetic paragangliomas present more commonly with mass-effect such as cranial nerve palsies, a neck mass or tinnitus. PathologyAll paragangliomas consist two types of cells; type I and type II. The main components are lobules or nests of chief cells (type I); these structures are known as Zellballen. They are surrounded by a single layer of sustentacular cells (type II) 4.Malignancy is defined as evidence of metastases. Histologically there are no reliable markers of malignant potential. Most common sites for malignancy include lymph nodes, liver, lung, and bone 5. Risk of malignancy:  pheochromocytoma: 10%  sympathetic paraganglioma: 20%  parasympathetic panganglioma: 2-20%  It is important to note biopsy (incision or fine needle aspirate) is contraindicated in suspected paragangliomas until biochemical screening is negative for catecholamine excess, due to the risk of catecholamine crisis and severe hypertension. LocationParasympathetic paragangliomasParasympathetic paragangliomas arise within paraganglia of the head and neck (see - paragangliomas of the head and neck) in association with the branches of the glossopharyngeal and vagus nerve 1. They are generally non-secretory.  carotid body paraganglioma (see carotid body tumor)   jugulotympanic paraganglioma  vagal paraganglioma   laryngeal paraganglioma  Sympathetic paragangliomasSympathetic paragangliomas generally arise in paraganglia below the level of the neck. They tend to secrete catecholamines and can be intra- or extra-adrenal.  extra-adrenal: arise outside the adrenal gland along the length of the sympathetic chain 2 abdomen organ of Zuckerkandl bladder base    thorax (see mediastinal paraganglioma)  paravertebral (aortosympathetic paraganglia) great vessels of the chest (aortopulmonary paraganglia) cardiac (extremely rare; may be located along the epicardium, in the atrial cavity, the interatrial septum or the ventricles) 3       intra-adrenal: arise within the adrenal medullapheochromocytoma  ImmunophenotypeImmunohistochemical examination confirms neuroendocrine differentiation of chief cells (type I):  neuron-specific enolase (NSE)  chromogranin-A synaptophysin Sustentacular cells (type II): S100 GFAP GeneticsParagangliomas are the most strongly hereditary group of tumors. The most common genetic cause of hereditary paragangliomas are mutations in the succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) subunit (SDHB, SDHD, SDHA or SDHAF2) 2. They are also associated with four clinical syndromes:  von Hippel-Lindau syndrome  multiple endocrine neoplasia types 2A and 2B  neurofibromatosis type 1 Carney-Stratakis syndrome von Hippel-Lindau syndrome and neurofibromatosis type 1 are more commonly associated with pheochromocytomas. SDH mutations are common in head and neck paragangliomas, except for SDHB, which is associated with sympathetic paragangliomas. SDHB also confers a higher risk of malignancy 2. Radiographic features Both anatomical and functional imaging of paragangliomas is required for diagnosis and staging. Anatomical imagining includes CT and MRI. Multiple functional imaging modalities exist:    123I-MIBG scintigraphy, 18F-FDA PET, 18F-DOPA PET, 18F-FDG PET and 68Ga-DOTATATE- PET. CT and MRI are the initial imaging modalities for tumor localization. They have excellent sensitivity, but lack specificity in unequivocally identifying a mass as a paraganglioma.CT density greater than 10 HU on non-contrast imaging (differentiates from adenoma) avidly enhances with contrast with delayed washout (due to rich capillary network) can detect lesions 0.5 cm in diameter 6  MRI   T1 hypointense to liver and adrenal salt and pepper appearance due to enhancing parenchyma (salt) and signal flow voids of vessels (pepper)    T2 hyperintense 'light bulb' appearance  salt and pepper enhancement also seen 7     T1 C+ (Gd): heterogenous prolonged enhancement Nuclear medicineTargets for functional imaging: tumor-specific catecholamine production: 123I-MIBG, 18F-FDA and 18F-DOPA PET   glucose: 18F-FDG  somatostatin receptor (overexpressed in paragangliomas):    [68Ga]-DOTATATE-PET  Each modality has strengths and weaknesses in detecting lesions depending on their location, secretory function and underlying genetic mutation.      123I-MIBG strength: pheochromocytomas and extra-adrenal sympathetic paragangliomas 8  weakness: head and neck, malignant disease, MEN2 9    18F-DOPA PET strength: head and neck paragangliomas, SDHD-mutations, non-metastatic disease 8,10  weakness: SDHB mutations 11    18F-FDA strength: metastatic disease, non-metastatic pheochromocytomas 12  weakness: limited clinical availability   18F-FDG PET strength: malignancy, SHDB-mutations, von Hippel-Lindau syndrome 8,13  weakness: may lack specificity   68Ga-DOTATATE PET strength: overall viable imaging modality; proven superiority in sporadic disease, SHDB-mutations, head and neck lesions 14-16  weakness: detection of liver and lung lesions  Treatment and prognosisTreatment may include surgical resection or radiotherapy. Paragangliomas may metastasize to other locations.Differential diagnosisDifferential diagnosis differs depending on the location and histology of the paraganglioma but can include 17: melanoma mesenchymal tumors adrenal cortical tumors 
__label__Head __label__& __label__Neck Paragangliomas of the head and neck are rare, representing <0.5% of all head and neck tumors. They arise in a number of locations along the carotid sheath and middle ear including the carotid bifurcation, vagal ganglia, jugular bulb, and tympanic plexus.For a general discussion of the pathology of these tumors please refer to the paraganglioma article. On this page:  Article: Epidemiology Clinical presentation Pathology Radiographic features Treatment and prognosis Differential diagnosis References   Images: Cases and figures Imaging differential diagnosis   EpidemiologyOverall there is a 3:1 female predominance. Two-thirds of cases are diagnosed between the ages of 40 and 60. Approximately 25% are multicentric, and these tend to be familial.Clinical presentationClinical presentation will depend on location.When involving the middle ear cavity, the tumor may grow large and extend into the external ear: these may present with pulsatile tinnitus, cranial nerve palsies (typically IX-XI, Vernet syndrome), or conductive hearing loss. Direct otoscopic examination may reveal a retrotympanic vascular mass.In the neck, the patient may present with a local mass. PathologyParagangliomas arise from neural crest cells. In the head and neck, paragangliomas tend to be innervated by the parasympathetic system and do not secrete catecholamines and are thus termed nonchromaffin paragangliomas 10. Multiple paragangliomas (both sporadic and familial subtypes) are commonly associated with mutations of the succinate dehydrogenase subunit genes 10. AssociationsAlthough often sporadically identified in otherwise normal individuals, paragangaliomas are seen associated with a number of systemic conditions including 10:  multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN)  neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1)  paraganglioma syndrome succinate dehydrogenase mutations  von Hippel-Lindau syndrome (vHL)  LocationThey are divided according to location:  carotid body tumor (or chemodectoma) located at the carotid body, and splaying the carotid bifurcation  most common paraganglioma of the head and neck (60-67% of total)    glomus tympanicum tumor arise from the glomus tympanicum  confined to the middle ear overlying the cochlear promontory  arises from the inferior tympanic branch of glossopharyngeal nerve (CN IX) (or Jacobson's nerve) second most common head and neck paraganglioma    glomus jugulotympanicum tumor arising from the glomus jugulotympanicum extending between the cochlear promontory and jugular foramen arising from Arnold's nerve, the mastoid branch of the vagus nerve (CN X)     glomus jugulare tumor arising from the glomus jugulare confined to the jugular foramen  extending into the middle ear     glomus vagale tumor arising from the glomus vagale associated with vagus nerve (CN X)  least common head and neck paraganglioma   Radiographic featuresCT useful when bone erosion occurs a moth-eaten pattern is typical MRI  T1: may show a “salt and pepper” appearance; salt representing blood products from hemorrhage (uncommon) and pepper representing flow voids due to high vascularity (common)  T1C+ (Gd): demonstrate rapid wash-in and wash-out (as opposed to the more slow and steady enhancement of a schwannoma) 9  Angiography intense tumor blush the most common feeding vessel is the ascending pharyngeal artery  Scintigraphyhigh uptake on 111In labeled octreotide 7-8 Treatment and prognosisTreatment is usually by excision. Preoperative endovascular embolization is often used to reduce tumor vascularity and aid excision. Radiotherapy may be used for palliation of unresectable lesions.Malignant transformation is not terribly uncommon and has been reported in 16-19% of glomus vagale tumors, in 6% of carotid body tumors, and in 2-4% of glomus tympanicum tumors.Differential diagnosisWhen completely imaged with CT and contrast-enhanced MRI usually little differential is present. During work-up, however, numerous entities should be considered. In the middle ear/petrous temporal bone consider: cholesterol granuloma cholesteatoma metastasis meninigoma  base of skull tumors  In the jugular and carotid region consider: jugular schwannoma lymph node metastasis/mass

__label__Chest Paragonimiasis is a disease caused by several species of the trematode genus Paragonimus. More than 50 different species of Paragonimus have been described in Asia, Africa, and the Americas and of those nine species infecting humans. The most important species is Paragonimus Westermani, which is distributed worldwide. Paragonimus heterotremus, P. siamensis and P. skrjabini are distributed in Asia. Paragonimus kellicotti is endemic in North America, P. mexicanus in Latin America, and P. africanus and P. uterobilateralis in Africa1 . On this page:  Article: Epidemiology Clinical presentation Pathology Treatment and prognosis References   Images:Cases and figures  EpidemiologyParagonimiasis Infections can occur after ingesting undercooked freshwater crayfish, crabs, or shrimp that are infected with encysted larvae 1. After penetration of the intestinal wall, juvenile worms (metacercariae) enter the inner wall of the abdominal cavity, these worms penetrate the diaphragm and then move to the lung parenchyma.The primary habitat of adult Paragonimus is the lung, and the most severe complication is secondary to the erratic migration of paragonimiasis to the brain. 2 Clinical presentationPulmonary paragonimiasis is the most common manifestation of the disease and usually presents one to twenty-seven months after infection. Patients generally present with chronic productive cough, hemoptysis, and chest pain. 3During the migration process, other parts of the body can be involved, such as the brain, skin, abdomen, heart, breast, intraspinal, and subcutaneous tissues.Cerebral paragonimiasis symptoms usually present after the onset of pulmonary symptoms and can include headaches, seizures, blurred visions, and gait disturbance, or even paralysis.1-3PathologyDiagnosis of paragonimiasis requires the finding of eggs in the sputum, feces, pleural, brain, effusion, cerebrospinal fluid, or other liquids. Ziehl-Neelsen staining can also be used for detection in the sputum as is done for tuberculosis. 1In sectioned surgical or biopsy specimens of extrapulmonary infections, juvenile or adult worms are also frequently detected.  ELISA testing should confirm the diagnosis.DNA probes, PCR, and PCR-based restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) analysis have been developed. 1-4Treatment and prognosisPraziquantel is the treatment for human paragonimiasis, 25 mg/kg three times daily for 2–3 days is the recommended dose and achieves 100% efficiency.  4Triclabendazole is a new drug for the treatment of paragonimiasis, but its efficacy is to be determined. 1

__label__Musculoskeletal Paralabral cysts of the hip joint are a location-specific subtype of paralabral cysts. They are predominantly small, sometimes septate, well-defined multiloculated fluid intensity lesions. They are closely associated with acetabular labral tears. Their presence requires a thorough search for a labral tear which may be missed as non-arthrographic MRI imaging may look deceivingly normal.Some authors have divided these into cysts that directly communicate with the synovial fluid of hip joint (true paralabral cysts) and those that do not (perilabral cyst). They may be confused with small bursal fluid collections around the hip joint, however, 90% of cystic lesions lateral to the iliopsoas are paralabral cysts. On this page:  Article: Epidemiology Clinical presentation Pathology Radiographic features Treatment and prognosis References   Images:Cases and figures  EpidemiologyUsually seen in 1-4% of the asymptomatic population and in 50-70% of patients with labral tears. They are more common in males.Clinical presentation anterior hip pain restriction of rotatory movements painful flexion at the hip snapping sensation PathologyThere is a close association with acetabular labral tears. Common underlying etiologies include: developmentally dysplastic hips trauma (including overuse: e.g. sports injuries) degenerative arthrosis It is thought that incongruity of the femoral head with acetabulum causes increased intraarticular pressure especially during flexion and rotatory movements of the hip joint, which forces the synovial fluid through the pathological labrum into the periarticular soft tissues.SizeUsual size range is around 3-30 mm.Location  anterosuperiorly: the majority ~ 56% 4   anteriorly: ~ 22%  posterosuperiorly: ~ 17%  anteroinferiorly: ~ 6% Radiographic featuresPlain radiographPlain radiographs have limited value for the diagnosis of labral pathology but an underlying cause (e.g. osteoarthritis or evidence of congenital hip disease) may be seen.UltrasoundUltrasound is helpful in cysts larger than 1.5 cm but gives little information about the labrum.MRIMRI with MRI arthrography is the modality of choice to detect paralabral cysts and delineate labral tears, hip dysplasia, signs of trauma, and degenerative changes. The vast majority are seen as multilocular cysts.   T2 / STIR: high signal  arthrography: fill with intra-articular contrast medium. Treatment and prognosisCysts may be aspirated but recur commonly. The definitive treatment is to surgically excise the cyst with an arthroscopic labral repair.  Arthroscopic cyst decompression and debridement of the degenerative labral tissues were performed using an arthroscopic thermal probe and a shaver is an effective surgical method of management.
__label__Musculoskeletal Paralabral cysts of the shoulder are a location-specific type of paralabral cysts. They are an infrequent finding on MRI, however, are an important diagnostic entity as they may cause a compression neuropathy of the suprascapular or axillary nerves depending on where they occur, along with a variety of other symptoms.  On this page:  Article: Epidemiology Pathology Radiographic features See also References   Images: Cases and figures Imaging differential diagnosis   EpidemiologyThey may occur in around 2-4% of the population and presentation may be commoner in males (especially around the third to fourth decades).PathologyThe exact pathogenesis is not well known and they may represent a synovial cyst, ganglion cyst or pseudocyst.AssociationsThere is a high association with glenoid labral tears.LocationThey most frequently occur along the posterior, anterior, and superior aspects of the glenohumeral joint in decreasing order, with inferiorly located cysts being the least common. The posterosuperior location may be the most common 5.Radiographic featuresUltrasoundMay be seen as a variably sized cyst in close proximity to the glenohumeral joint.MRIA paralabral cyst is termed when a focal well-defined collection of fluid is seen within 1 cm of the glenoid labrum. They can be unilocular or multilocular. They may be difficult to identify on MR arthrography unless a T2 sequence is performed. Direct communication between a cyst and joint is not commonly seen.See alsospinoglenoid notch ganglion cyst

__label__Head __label__& __label__Neck The paranasal sinuses usually consist of four paired air-filled spaces. They have several functions of which reducing the weight of the head is the most important. Other functions are air humidification and aiding in voice resonance. They are named for the facial bones in which they are located: maxillary sinus sphenoid sinus ethmoid sinus frontal sinus Variant anatomyThe paranasal sinuses are subject to marked variation between individuals and between sides in the same individual, regarding size (aeration) and bony septations. Total paranasal sinus agenesis is very rare 1. Isolated frontal sinus agenesis, on the other hand, is common.

__label__Head __label__& __label__Neck __label__Trauma Paranasal sinuses are air-filled cavities surrounding the nasal cavity proper which includes maxillary sinus, sphenoid sinus, frontal sinus and ethmoid sinus. Trauma to the superior and middle thirds of the face can often lead to in paranasal sinus fractures involving one or more paranasal sinuses. Furthermore, forces greater than paranasal sinus resistance may result in traumatic brain injury.  On this page:  Article: Epidemiology Clinical presentation Anatomy and pathology Radiographic features  Treatment and prognosis Related articles References   Images:Cases and figures  EpidemiologyMales in their 20-30s are the most common group to sustain facial trauma 2,3,4,5. The etiology for facial trauma causing paranasal fractures varies geographically. In urban regions, assaults and motor vehicle accidents are the main reasons for facial trauma. By contrast, in rural regions, animal-related accidents are the main cause of facial trauma 4-6. Clinical presentationPresenting complaint is usually facial pain and in some instances deformity although facial swelling can make the assessment of sinus wall depression difficult. Specific clinical signs unique to sinuses are discussed below. Often other injuries (e.g. upper limb, cranial and thoracic) are present that may be more clinically impressive. As such imaging with CT is often the first time a paranasal sinus fracture is suspected 7. Anatomy and pathologyTraumatic forces directed at the facial skeleton is transmitted and absorbed by a framework of facial bones that surround paranasal sinuses. Disruption to the bony framework results in paranasal sinus fractures. The Le Fort classification system categorizes common types of bony framework disruption along "lines of weakness" and can be associated with certain types of paranasal sinus fractures. In addition to Le Fort classification system, other classifications have been devised for facial fractures that are too complex for the Le Fort fracture lines which focus on anatomical subunits of the mid-face including zygomaticomaxillary complex (ZMC), the naso-orbitoethmoidal complex (NOE), and the dentoalveolar complex (DAC).  Le Fort I and II fractures, ZMC fractures: associated with maxillary sinus fracture (most common paranasal sinus fracture)   Le Fort II and III fractures: associated with ethmoid sinus fracture NOE fractures: associated with frontal/ethmoid sinus fracture  Maxillary sinus fractureMaxillary sinus fractures can occur in isolation from a direct blow, or as part of a more extensive injury such as Le Fort fractures. the commonest mechanism of injury high-energy trauma to the eyeball 8    common injuries and fracture sites  blow-out fracture: floor of orbit/roof of sinus 9  Iatrogenic injury (e.g. displaced dental implant) - inferior sinus wall    specific symptoms hypoesthesia of upper lip/dental arch, diplopia    complications oro-antral fistulae, maxillary sinus infection   Frontal sinus fractureFrontal sinus fractures are relatively uncommon, usually seen in the setting of other facial fractures.  commonest mechanism of injurymotor vehicle accident 10    common fracture sites  anterior sinus wall posterior sinus wall    red flag symptoms fever, clear nasal discharge, altered conscious state    complicationsdural tear, CSF rhinorrhea, mucocele, and intracranial infection (e.g. meningoencephalitis) 11,12   Ethmoidal sinus fracture Ethmoidal sinus fractures are usually seen in the setting of nasal fractures (naso-orbitoethmoid complex fractures). commonest mechanism of injury motor vehicle accident  common fracture site superior sinus wall (cribriform plate)  isolated injury rare, usually associated with injury to NOE complex and frontal sinus specific symptoms hyposomia, anosmia    complicationsolfactory nerve damage, dacryocystitis, CSF rhinorrhea, and intracranial infection 13,14   Sphenoidal sinus fractureTranssphenoidal fractures are usually seen in the setting of more extensive base of skull fractures, often extending to involve anterior cranial fossa or petrous temporal bones.  mechanism of injury various   isolated injury rare, usually associated with complex craniofacial injuries  specific symptoms clear nasal discharge, visual disturbance    complications 15 optic/oculomotor nerve damage, internal carotid artery damage, CSF rhinorrhea  Radiographic features A plain radiograph may be used to assess a number of structures but CT scans are now the gold standard in diagnosis and surgical planning of facial trauma. Plain radiograph  Waters projection for assessment of maxillary bone/sinus, orbit, zygomatic arch   Caldwell projection for assessment of frontal, and ethmoid sinus, orbit, frontozygomatic sutures  CT blood in sinus 16  dislocated bone fragments air in soft tissues   pneumocephalus: associated with ethmoidal/sphenoidal sinus fractures  Treatment and prognosisTreatment is dictated by the complexity of facial fracture, sinus wall location and associated injuries. Conservative management can be an option for maxillary, frontal and ethmoid sinus fractures. For example, anterior wall of the frontal sinus is usually managed conservatively, by contrast, posterior wall of frontal sinus require surgery due to potential extension into intracranial space. Sphenoidal sinus fracture always requires surgery due to the presence of neurovascular structures in the sinus.

__label__Head __label__& __label__Neck Paranasal sinus mucoceles represent complete opacification of one or more paranasal sinuses by mucus, often associated with bony expansion due to obstruction of the nasal sinus drainage. On this page:  Article: Clinical presentation Pathology Radiographic features Treatment and prognosis Differential diagnosis Related articles References   Images: Cases and figures Imaging differential diagnosis   Clinical presentationClinical presentation depends on two factors: location and direction of expansion presence of infection Mucoceles distort local anatomy and exert pressure on adjacent structures as they enlarge. Examples include: frontal mucocele extending into the front of the orbit, presenting as a mass posterior ethmoidal mucocele compressing the orbital apex  sphenoidal mucocele extending posteriorly to impinge on the pituitary gland and brainstem  maxillary mucocele may elevate the orbital floor with resultant proptosis  If a mucocele becomes infected, the clinical presentation is similar to acute sinusitis, with the potential extension of infection into adjacent spaces: intracranial: subdural empyema, meningitis, cerebral abscess  orbit: subperiosteal abscess  subcutaneous: e.g. Pott puffy tumor  PathologyMucoceles most likely occur as a result of obstruction of the ostium of a sinus due to inflammation, trauma, mass lesion, etc., with resultant accumulation of mucus and eventual expansion of the sinus. Some authors (the minority) believe that they represent a mucous retention cyst that gradually enlarges, eventually filling the whole sinus 2. Chronic non-invasive fungal sinusitis has also been associated with the formation of mucoceles 2,3. From a radiological point of view, which of these hypotheses is correct is immaterial.The content of the mucocele is variable, and this impacts on the imaging appearances (see below). Most simple mucoceles are formed by clear thick mucus. If the mucocele has been infected (pyocele) then the content is similar to pus.LocationThe frontal sinus is particularly prone to developing mucoceles, and up to two-thirds of all mucoceles occur there. The ethmoidal sinuses are the next most common (~25%), whereas the maxillary and sphenoid sinuses are infrequently involved 2.Subtypes (location specific) frontal mucocele frontoethmoidal mucocele ethmoid mucocele sphenoid sinus mucocele maxillary sinus mucocele Associations cystic fibrosis: particularly if occurring in children 4 Radiographic featuresMucoceles are best imaged with a combination of CT (to assess bony changes) and MRI (to assess any extension into the orbit or intracranial compartment). The presence of air within an affected sinus rules out the possibility of a mucocele 5.Plain radiographSkull radiographs do not have a significant role to play in the diagnosis of mucoceles. If obtained, they demonstrate opacification and expansion of the affected sinus.CTThe affected sinus is completely opacified and the margins are expanded and usually thinned. Areas of complete bone resorption may be present, resulting in bony defect and extension of the 'mass' into adjacent tissues 2,3. Peripheral calcification is sometimes seen 2. Following administration of contrast, only peripheral enhancement (if any) is seen.The content of the sinus is variable, depending on the degree of hydration, ranging from near-water attenuation to hyperattenuating as secretions become increasingly thick and desiccated 3.MRIMRI signal intensity is highly variable and depends on the proportions of water, mucus and protein 1-3:  T1  water-rich content: low signal (most common) protein-rich content: high signal    T2 water-rich content: high signal (most common) protein-rich content: low signal    T1 C+ (Gd): enhancement, if present, only occurs at the periphery  DWI: variable NB: colonization with fungus can lead to very low signal on both T1 and T2 weighted sequences, mimicking a normal aerated sinus 3.Treatment and prognosisIn general, drainage and marsupialisation of an affected sinus are sufficient. If large bony defects are present, reconstructive surgery may be necessary (e.g. of the orbital floor). If drainage remains impaired, the mucocele may recur.Differential diagnosisThere is often little differential, if any, provided that contrast material has been administered. The differential includes: paranasal sinus tumors, e.g. inverted papilloma or sinonasal carcinomamost of these enhance   mucus retention cyst does not completely fill the sinus no bony expansion    antrochoanal polypfocally protrudes through the ostiomeatal complex    acute sinusitisno bony expansion   Aspergillus spp. infection 6,7  
__label__Head __label__& __label__Neck Paranasal sinuses mycetomas, or fungus balls, are indolent and non-invasive fungal colonization of the paranasal sinuses.   On this page:  Article: Pathology Radiographic features Differential diagnosis Related articles References   Images:Cases and figures  PathologyPathogenesis is thought to be a cascade of processes from insufficient mucociliary clearance leading to sinus colonization and chronic inflammatory response. The patient may only have a mild symptom or be asymptomatic. Radiographic featuresCTCommonly only a single sinus is affected by the predilection for the maxillary sinus followed by the sphenoid sinus. The frontal and ethmoid are less often affected. A clue to the diagnosis includes soft tissue density within the sinus with/without foci of calcific deposit. Postobstructive change may be observed if the mycetoma obstructs the sinus drainage pathway leading to partial or complete sinus opacification 2. Evidence of chronic inflammation with sclerosis and thickening of the wall of the paranasal sinuses. Careful evaluation of the sinus cavity is prudent to exclude bone erosion that is not a feature of mycetoma / chronic fungal sinusitis rather a feature of acute invasive fungal sinusitis 2.MRIMRI signal characteristics of mycetomas reflect the internal content of the mycelia, vegetative part of a fungus consisting of a conglomerate of hyphae. This contains primarily carbohydrates with some glycoproteins, macromolecular proteins, and iron and manganese.Signal characteristics  T1: low signal  T2: low signal.

__label__Head __label__& __label__Neck Osteoma of the paranasal sinuses is a common benign tumor, usually found incidentally. On this page:  Article: Epidemiology Clinical presentation Pathology Radiographic features Treatment and prognosis Differential diagnosis Related articles References   Images:Cases and figures  EpidemiologyOsteomas are commonly found in patients undergoing imaging of the sinuses, appearing in up to 3% of CT examinations of the paranasal sinuses 1. They are most frequently diagnosed in 20-50 years olds, and there is a male predilection (M:F = 1.5-2.6:1) 1.Clinical presentationMost osteomas are asymptomatic and are found incidentally when imaging the sinuses either for sinonasal symptoms or for unrelated complaints.Osteomas may become symptomatic in one of two ways: direct mass effect obstruction of normal sinus drainage Three possible mechanisms for pain are suggested: local effect, referred pain via the trigeminal nerve, and a prostaglandin E-2 mediated mechanism 5. There can be a significant inversely proportional discrepancy between the size of the lesion and the symptoms; do not simply assume because the lesion is small it does not account for the patient's symptoms.Some osteomas are large and exophytic. They may be palpable (as is the case with skull vault osteomas) or compress structures, such as the content of the orbit 1-3. Rarely an osteoma may encroach upon the brain, and may even result in erosion of the dura with resultant CSF leak, pneumocephalus or intracranial infection (meningitis, cerebral abscess) 1,2,4.More frequently they may impair normal drainage of one or more paranasal sinuses thereby resulting in acute or chronic sinusitis or even mucocele formation 1,3.PathologyLocationOsteomas are frequently seen elsewhere in the head and neck, particularly the mandible and outer table of the skull vault. There is a particular frequency distribution within the paranasal sinuses 1-3: frontal sinuses: 80% ethmoid air cells: ~15% maxillary sinuses: ~5% sphenoid sinus: rare 2  AssociationsThere is a well-recognized association with Gardner syndrome 1. Approximately 30% of patients have a history of rhinosinusitis, although a causal link has not been established 1.SubtypesOsteomas are, as the name suggests, osteogenic tumors composed of mature bone. Three histological patterns are recognized 1:  ivory osteoma  also known as eburnated osteoma most common 2  dense bone lacking Haversian system    mature osteoma  also known as osteoma spongiosum resembles 'normal' bone, including trabecular bone often with marrow    mixed osteoma a mixture of ivory and mature histology  Radiographic featuresThe radiographic appearance is that of a dense well-circumscribed mass. Ivory osteomas are uniformly very dense, whereas mature osteomas may resemble 'normal' bone with marrow space sometimes visible.CTCT demonstrates a well-circumscribed mass of variable density, varying from very dense (similar in density to normal cortical bone) to less dense with a ground-glass appearance. They are seen either with a sinus or less commonly exophytically growing out of a sinus.MRIOn MRI, ivory osteomas demonstrate low signal intensity on all sequence. Mature osteomas may demonstrate some marrow signal but are also predominantly low signal on all sequences.Treatment and prognosisIn asymptomatic cases excision is not necessarily indicated, and management varies from surgeon to surgeon. If sinonasal symptoms are present, then they can initially be managed medically (as if the osteoma is not present). In cases where the osteoma is thought to be responsible for symptoms (e.g. mucocele) then resection is required. Some surgeons prefer to excise all osteomas.Excision may be performed either endoscopically or externally.Differential diagnosisGeneral imaging differential considerations include:  fibrous dysplasia: especially in less dense ground-glass osteomas other osteogenic tumors osteoblastoma  osteosarcoma more frequently of the maxilla (rather than maxillary sinus or mandible) younger patients more aggressive appearance and rapid growth    cemento-ossifying fibroma 2usually of the alveolar portions of the mandible or maxilla

__label__Gastrointestinal __label__Chest Para-esophageal hernias (POH), or rolling hernias, are an uncommon type of hiatal hernia representing ~10% of all hiatal hernias. The majority of the hiatal hernias being of the sliding type. On this page:  Article: Clinical presentation Pathology Treatment and prognosis Differential diagnosis References   Images:Cases and figures  Clinical presentationCan vary and can include: asymptomatic  gastro-esophageal reflux disease (mainly hiatus hernia) substernal, post-prandial chest pain epigastric pain dysphagia nausea/vomiting obstruction diaphragmatic impingement on the stomach gastric volvulus compression of the esophagus by the intrathoracic stomach   respiratory complications associated with a large para-esophageal hernia recurrent aspiration, pneumonia, and chronic cough   PathologyA para-esophageal hernia includes a peritoneal layer that forms a true hernia sac, distinguishing it from the more common sliding hiatal hernia.In para-esophageal hernia, there is an upward dislocation of the gastric fundus alongside a normally positioned gastroesophageal junction. The gastric fundus and sometimes abdominal viscera protrude into the mediastinum through the defect in the diaphragm.In contrast, a sliding hernia does not have a hernia sac and slides into the chest since the gastro-esophageal junction (GEJ) is not fixed inside the abdomen.ClassificationGenerally, a hiatus hernia is classified into four types.  type I - sliding hernia: GEJ migrates into the posterior mediastinum through the esophageal hiatus   type II-IV - para-esophageal hernias type II: occurs when the fundus herniates through the hiatus alongside a normally positioned GEJ type III: is a combination of types I and II hernias with a displaced GEJ as well as hernia sac containing portions of the fundus/body of stomach protruding through the hiatus type IV: characterized by displacement of the stomach along with other organs (colon, spleen, pancreas and small bowel) into the thorax   Treatment and prognosisSurgical management is indicated when medical management fails to control symptoms of gastro-esophageal reflux that may be related to the POH, or when there is an emergent complication.According to the Society of American Gastrointestinal and Endoscopic Surgeons 2013 guidelines: in the absence of reflux disease, repair of a type I hernia is unnecessary all symptomatic paraesophageal hiatal hernias (types II-IV) should be repaired, especially in the presence of acute obstructive symptoms or volvulus Differential diagnosisOn a chest radiograph, possible considerations include: lung abscess lower esophageal duplications cyst  lower thoracic aortic aneurysm  neurenteric cyst epiphrenic diverticulum 
__label__Gynaecology Paraovarian cysts are remnants of Wolffian duct in the mesosalpinx that do not arise from the ovary. They account for ~10-20% of adnexal masses 3,4. On this page:  Article: Terminology Epidemiology Clinical presentation Pathology Radiographic features Treatment and prognosis Differential diagnosis Related articles References   Images:Cases and figures  TerminologyParaovarian cysts are also sometimes referred to as paratubal cysts or hydatid cysts of Morgagni 14.EpidemiologyThey typically occur in women at the ages of 20-40 years old.Clinical presentationMost are asymptomatic, although patients with large lesions can present with pelvic pain.PathologyThey usually occur around the broad ligament and arise from paramesonephric, mesothelial, or mesonephric remnants. They are usually simple cysts (although some authors include paraovarian cystadenomas under the umbrella of paraovarian cysts).Radiographic featuresA paraovarian cyst is easier to recognize if the ipsilateral ovary is demonstrated to be separate from it. Pelvic ultrasound typically thin-walled and smoothly marginated typically unilocular simple cyst (in ~66%); rarely multilocular (~4%) cyst moves independently of ovary when transducer pressure is applied rarely, a soft tissue nodule in the cyst may indicate the development of a neoplasm 9  Pelvic MRIOften seen located close to the ipsilateral round ligament and are often of homogenous signal intensity. In uncomplicated cases, signal characteristics usually follow that of fluid 12.  T1 hypointense can be hyperintense if complicated by hemorrhage    T2hyperintense  Other features include beak sign 11 Treatment and prognosisParaovarian cysts occasionally can be complicated by rupture, torsion, or hemorrhage. Large or symptomatic cysts often undergo surgical resection. Smaller asymptomatic ones are treated conservatively. Given a small chance of representing neoplasm, paraovarian cystic lesions may be recommended for follow-up imaging. Societal guidelines differ in this regard.The 2010 Society of Radiologists in Ultrasound consensus statement recommends follow-up of simple paraovarian cysts in situations similar to that of simple ovarian cysts 13: 5-7 cm simple cyst in premenopausal women: yearly ultrasound 1-7 cm simple cyst in potmenopausal women: yearly ultrasound >7 cm simple cyst in any age: further imaging (e.g., MRI) or surgical evaluation In contrast, the American College of Radiology Ovarian-Adnexal Reporting and Data System (O-RADS) for ultrasound, published in 2019, recommends the following 15: any size simple paraovarian cyst in premenopausal women: no follow-up any size simple paraovarian cyst in postmenopausal women: optional single follow-up study in 1 year nonsimple paraovarian cysts: management dependent on risk stratification as per ovarian criteria Finally, the American College of Radiology Incidental Findings Committee on adnexal findings on CT or MRI recommends that for paraovarian cysts with characteristic features, further imaging is usually unnecessary 16.Differential diagnosisFor an adnexal cystic lesion consider: true ovarian cyst   ovarian cystic neoplasm: typically has a solid component  paraovarian cystadenoma: typically has a small solid nodule or septum pelvic peritoneal inclusion cyst

__label__Head __label__& __label__Neck Parapharyngeal abscesses are deep neck abscesses involving the parapharyngeal space. It is a serious medical condition, potentially fatal, and requires prompt diagnosis and treatment. On this page:  Article: Epidemiology Clinical presentation Pathology Treatment and prognosis References   Images:Cases and figures  EpidemiologyA person of any age can develop a parapharyngeal abscess, but it is most commonly seen in children and adolescents 1. Immunocompromised adults are also at an increased risk 2.Clinical presentationPresentation is variable, the first symptoms of a parapharyngeal abscess are similar to those of uncomplicated acute pharyngitis or tonsiliits (fever, sore throat, nasal voice, dysphonia, cervical lymphadenopathy). Progression of the signs and symptoms is key as it pertains to inflammation and obstruction of the upper airways and/or gastrointestinal tract and there may be dysphagia, dyspnea, stridor, neck stiffness, drooling, trismus and/or chest pain.PathologyUsually, parapharyngeal abscesses arise secondary to oropharyngeal infections that spread either by direct continuity or by lymphatic drainage: acute and chronic tonsillitis  bursting of peritonsillar abscess  dental infection usually comes from the lower last molar tooth Bezold abscess petrositis spread from other deep head and neck spaces (e.g. parotid, retropharyngeal or submandibular spaces) secondary to penetrating trauma of the neck iatrogenic e.g. injection of local anesthetic for tonsillectomy or mandibular nerve block Treatment and prognosisWhen a parapharyngeal abscess is detected, treatment should commence immediately. It can usually be treated with broad-spectrum parenteral antibiotics and surgical drainage.

__label__Head __label__& __label__Neck The parapharyngeal space, also known as the prestyloid parapharyngeal space, is a deep compartment of the head and neck around which most other suprahyoid fascial spaces are arranged. It consists largely of fat, neurovascular structures, and, in some definitions, the retromandibular part of the deep lobe of the parotid gland. On this page:  Article: Terminology Gross anatomy Radiographic features Related pathology Related articles References   Images:Cases and figures  TerminologyTwo naming conventions exist in the literature. In the first definition, familiar to most head and neck surgeons, the parapharyngeal space is divided into prestyloid and poststyloid (retrostyloid) compartments 1-3,10. In the second definition, introduced by some radiologists, the prestyloid parapharygeal space is simply termed the parapharyngeal space, and the poststyloid pharapharygeal space is termed the carotid space 4-6. The latter facilitates differential diagnosis and is used in this article.Other terms for the parapharyngeal space include the lateral pharyngeal space, pharyngomaxillary space, and even less commonly pterygomaxillary space, pterygopharyngeal space, peripharyngeal space, pterygomandibular space, and pharyngomasticatory space 1.Gross anatomyThe parapharyngeal space is shaped like an inverted pyramid, with its base at the skull base, with its apex inferiorly pointing towards the greater cornu of the hyoid bone 2.Contents fat (main component) vessels ​​internal maxillary artery, depending on its course  ascending pharyngeal artery, depending on its course  pterygoid venous plexus, in its portion surrounded by fat (the rest is within the masticator space)   nervesmall branch of the mandibular division of the trigeminal nerve (cranial nerve V3) supplying the tensor veli palatini muscle  salivary tissue minor or ectopic salivary gland/rests retromandibular portion of the deep lobe of parotid gland, in some definitions 1-3    Lymph nodes and muscle are not included in the radiological definition of the parapharyngeal space.BoundariesThe parapharyngeal space has complex fascial margins occupying the space between the muscles of mastication and the muscles of deglutition 1-6: superior: base of skull  inferior: greater cornu of the hyoid bone, although some state the space functionally ends higher, with the styloglossus muscle at the level of the angle of the mandible 1  medial: middle layer of the deep cervical fascia covering the superior pharyngeal constrictor and levator and tensor veli palatini muscles lateral: superficial layer of the deep cervical fascia extending between styloid process and mandibular ramus, covering the parotid and lateral pterygoid muscle, although some state the fascia creates the stylomandibular tunnel through which part of the deep lobe of the parotid protrudes into the parapharyngeal space 1  anterior: pterygomandibular raphe and superficial layer of the deep cervical fascia covering the medial pterygoid muscle  posterior: an extension of tensor veli palatini muscle fascia termed the tensor-vascular-styloid fascia 1,10-12; or an extension of the fascia of the stylopharyngeus, styloglossus, and levator veli palatini muscles 13,14  Relations posteromedial to the masticator space, particularly medial pterygoid muscle anteromedial to the parotid space  posterolateral to the pharyngeal mucosal space  anterolateral to the prevertebral space, retropharyngeal space, and danger space  anterior to the carotid (poststyloid parapharyngeal) space  overlaps with the infratemporal fossa 5  Radiographic featuresCT/MRIThe parapharyngeal space appears triangular in the axial plane with density/signal consistent with fat.Knowledge about the displacement patterns of fat within the parapharyngeal space will aid in the localization of lesions within adjacent deep spaces of the head and neck.

These nerves form the parasympathetic portion of the autonomic nervous system in the pelvis.   On this page:  Article: Gross anatomy Variant anatomy Related pathology Related articles References   Images:Cases and figures  Gross anatomyOriginThe pelvic splanchnic are preganglionic nerves that arise from the lateral horn of sacral segments of the S2, S3 and S4 nerve roots of the sacral plexus, though the greatest contribution of these fibers is usually from the S3 nerve. The preganglionic cell bodies that contribute to parasympathetic pelvic splanchnic nerves originate from the lateral horn (lateral grey column) of the sacral segments of S2 to S4.CourseThe pelvic splanchnic nerves anastamose with one another and ascend to join the ipsliateral inferior hypogastric plexus. The inferior hypogastric plexuses are paired structures that lie on either side of the rectum and contain both sympathetic and parasympathetic fibers. After reaching the inferior hypogastric plexus, the pelvic splanchnic nerves ramify throughout the pelvis and lower abdomen innervating ganglia embedded in walls of the descending and sigmoid colon, rectum, ureter, prostate, bladder, urethra and penis.It should be noted that on the left some fibers rise out of the pelvis, pass to the left of the superior hypogastric plexus and join periarterial plexuses surrounding the inferior mesenteric artery to supply the large intestine distal to the splenic flexure.RelationsThe pelvic splanchnic nerves and the hypogastric plexuses merge within the pelvis. The superior and inferior hypogastric plexuses are networks of sympathetic and visceral afferent nerve fibers. The superior hypogastric plexus is a continuation of the intermesenteric plexus which sits just inferior to the bifurcation of the aorta. The superior hypogastric plexus enters the pelvis dividing in to right and left hypogastric nerves which descend (on the anterior surface of the sacrum) to the lateral aspect of the rectum within ‘hypogastric sheaths’ and merge with the pelvic splanchnic nerves to form left and right inferior hypogastric plexuses.Variant anatomyThe pelvic splanchnic nerves have a variable course of anastomosing with one another until they merge with the hypogastric nerves on either side of the rectum.Related pathologyHirschprung’s disease (also known as aganlionic megacolon) is the congential absence of parasympathetic ganglia within the large bowel. The resulting lack of peristalsis in the affected bowel segment causes obstruction and enlargement of the bowel proximal to the aganglionic segment. The incidence of Hirschprung’s disease is approximately 1 in 5000 live births and treatment is resection and removal of the aganglionic portion of bowel.

On this page:  Article: Clinical presentation Pathology Radiographic features Treatment and prognosis Differential diagnosis Related articles References   Images:Cases and figures  Clinical presentationPatients present with primary hyperparathyroidism: elevated serum calcium levels and elevated serum parathyroid hormone levels. This results in multisystem effects including osteoporosis, renal calculi, constipation, peptic ulcers, mental changes, fatigue, and depression.PathologyThey are usually oval or bean-shaped, but larger adenomas can be multilobulated. The vast majority (up to 87% 2) of adenomas occur as solitary lesions.LocationThe majority of parathyroid adenomas are juxtathyroid and located immediately posterior or inferior to the thyroid gland. Superior gland parathyroid adenomas may lie posteriorly in the tracheo-esophageal groove, paraesophageal location, or even as inferior as the mediastinum 12.Up to 5% of parathyroid adenomas can occur in ectopic locations. Common ectopic locations include 1,12: mediastinum retropharyngeal carotid sheath intrathyroidal Variants parathyroid lipoadenoma 16 SerologyParathyroid hormone levels are usually elevated (usual normal reference range 1.6-6.9 pmol/L or 10 to 55 pg/mL).Radiographic featuresUltrasoundUltrasound is one of the most commonly used initial imaging modalities.Greyscale most nodules need to be >1 cm to be confidently seen on ultrasound parathyroid adenomas tend to be homogeneously hypoechoic vs the overlying thyroid gland an echogenic thyroid capsule separating the thyroid from the parathyroid may be seen Doppler ultrasoundCan commonly show a characteristic extrathyroidal feeding vessel (typically a branch off the inferior thyroidal artery 1,6), which enters the parathyroid gland at one of the poles. Internal vascularity is also commonly seen in a peripheral distribution. This feeding artery tends to branch around the periphery of the gland before penetration. This feature can give a characteristic arc or rim of vascularity. The overlying thyroid gland may also show an area of asymmetric hypervascularity that may help to locate an underlying adenoma.Nuclear medicineCan be very useful for localizing the lesion when the site is not known. Shows increased uptake with agents such as technetium (Tc) 99m Sestamibi (MIBI) (commonly used agent) and Tc-99m tetrofosmin. The nuclear medicine scan can be fused with the CT scan as a SPECT scan to increase diagnostic accuracy and aid in anatomical localization. 18F-fluorocholine PET/CT may also have a role 18.CTIn the past, CT was more commonly used in the setting of a failed parathyroidectomy for the detection of suspected ectopic glands (often mediastinal) 6.  However, in recent years, 4D-CT has emerged as valuable modality especially in the era of minimally-invasive parathyroidectomy. This type of surgery requires precise localization with anatomical detail and a confident diagnosis of parathyroid adenoma. 4DCT has been shown to be more sensitive than sonography and scintigraphy for preoperative localization of parathyroid adenomas 13,15.Enhancement on 4D-CTOn 4D-CT parathyroid adenomas typically demonstrate intense enhancement on arterial phase, washout of contrast on delayed phase and low attenuation on non-contrast imaging 12.Secondary signs include 14: the polar vessel which represents an enlarged feeding artery or draining vein to the hypervascular parathyroid adenoma a larger lesion size increases the confidence of diagnosis parathyroid adenomas can also show cystic change MRIMRI is infrequently utilized in initial work up because of lower spatial resolution and artifacts. Adenomas can show variable signal intensity on MRI. Reported signal characteristics include:  T1 typically intermediate to low signal subacute hemorrhage can cause high signal intensity 6  fibrosis or old hemorrhage can cause low signal intensity 6     T2 typically hyperintense subacute hemorrhage can cause high signal intensity 6  fibrosis or old hemorrhage can cause low signal intensity 6    Since most lesions demonstrate high T2 signal intensity, the addition of contrast for MRI does not significantly increase detection.Treatment and prognosisSurgery is successful in treating primary hyperparathyroidism caused by parathyroid adenomas in 95-98% of cases 17.Differential diagnosisFor a non-ectopic adenoma on ultrasound, consider: parathyroid hyperplasia eccentric thyroid nodule  sequestered thyroid tissue lymph node vessel

The main role of CT and MRI is to assess for metastatic disease and recurrence 2.UltrasoundA study of 69 cases of parathyroid lesions >15 mm in size, of which eight were carcinomas, and the rest adenomas, examined the useful differentiating sonographic features 4. It was found that the presence of invasiveness or calcification of the lesion had a 100% positive predictive value (PPV) for carcinoma. Conversely, those features with a high negative predictive value (NPV) were: absence of suspicious vascularity (NPV 98%)radial vascularity without clear feeding vessels  absent thick capsule (NPV 97%) homogeneity of contents (NPV 100%) The presence/absence of necrotic/cystic change is sufficiently common in benign disease that it only has a limited role as a discriminator 4. Features favoring parathyroid carcinoma: heterogeneity of contents lobulated morphology larger: often >3 cm Features favoring parathyroid adenoma: homogeneity of contents regular morphology smaller Nuclear medicineTechnetium-99m sestamibi scintigraphy is very helpful in the localization of parathyroid adenomas (sensitivity up to 98%) but struggles to differentiate carcinomas and adenomas 3.Treatment and prognosisSurgical resection is the mainstay of therapy.

__label__Musculoskeletal __label__Head __label__& __label__Neck Parathyroid hormone (PTH), also known as parathormone, is secreted by the parathyroid glands in response to hypocalcemia. Its main physiologic effects are to increase osteoclastic activity in bone increase renal reabsorption of calcium inhibit renal absorption of phosphate and bicarbonate stimulate renal synthesis of 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol from vitamin D  All of the above effects result in a net increase of serum ionized calcium, most of which is bound to albumin.Parathyroid hormone is counteracted by calcitonin, a 32-amino acid peptide hormone produced by the parafollicular cells of the thyroid gland, which decreases serum calcium concentration. On this page:  Article: Chemistry Physiology Related pathology Related articles References   ChemistryParathyroid hormone (PTH) is synthesized and secreted by the parathyroid chief cells. It is first synthesized as a preprohormone, consisting of a 110-amino acid polypeptide chain. It is then cleaved to a 90-amino acid prohormone, then cleaved again to the active 84-amino acid hormone. Smaller fragments with as little as 34 amino acids connected to the N-terminus are responsible for much of the hormonal activity, as PTH has a half-life of <5 minutes 1.PhysiologyCalcium and phosphate absorption from boneOsteolysis is a rapid phase of calcium and phosphate removal from bones that increases progressively for several hours. The osteocytes within the bone, as well as the osteocytes and osteoblasts on the bone surface, are interconnected by long filmy processes called the osteocytic membrane system. Parathyroid hormone binds to receptor proteins on the cell membranes of osteocytes and osteoblasts, thereby stimulating calcium pumps in the osteocytic membrane. Calcium diffuses from the bone fluid into the cell membrane, then out of the cells through pumps on the other side of the cells into the extracellular fluid. This is the mechanism by which calcium phosphate salts are removed from amorphous bone crystals 1,2. Osteoclast formation and activation is, by contradistinction, a much slower phase that continues for weeks to months. Osteoclast progenitor cells are devoid of receptor proteins for parathyroid hormone; however, they express the RANK (receptor activator of nuclear factor-κ B) cell surface receptor. PTH-activated osteoblasts express the surface protein RANKL (RANK ligand). RANKL ligation to RANK activates a series of downstream signaling pathways that culminate in osteoclast maturation and activation 1,2.Calcium excretion and phosphate excretionPTH increases the renal tubular reabsorption of calcium. At the same time, it decreases renal phosphate reabsorption. Without its effect on the kidneys, continual loss of calcium into the urine would eventually cause calcium depletion in both the extracellular fluid and the bones 1,2.Stimulation of 1,25-cholecalciferol synthesisCholecalciferol (vitamin D3) is synthesized in the skin. It is converted to 25-hydroxycholecalciferol in the liver. In the kidneys, parathyroid hormone stimulates its conversion to 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol, which, in turn, promotes intestinal absorption of calcium and phosphate 1,2.Related pathology hyperparathyroidism  hypoparathyroidism pseudohypoparathyroidismpseudopseudohypoparathyroidism   hypercalcemia in paraneoplastic endocrine syndromes

__label__Chest Parenchymal lung diseases can broadly be divided into those that create an abnormal increase in density on a chest radiograph and those that cause increased lucency. The attenuation of any tissue on a radiograph is related to its density and in the lung, this is determined by the ratio of gas to surrounding soft tissue (blood, lung parenchyma or stroma) - normally 11 to 1. Any process that increases the amount of soft tissue creates a significant decrease in this ratio resulting in increased opacification. By virtue of the normal ratio of gas to soft tissue, this is more apparent on plain radiography than any process that decreases the amount of soft tissue, e.g. reduced blood flow, parenchymal or stromal destruction. CT, with its superior contrast resolution, is more sensitive when assessing overall decreases in radiographic density.Pulmonary opacificationAbnormal pulmonary opacification may be subdivided into smaller groups by the pattern it creates on radiographic studies. These patterns have been shown to accurately represent the underlying pulmonary pathologic processes and are a practical way to generate a differential diagnosis. The patterns include:  airspace opacification : consolidation  atelectatic opacification : collapse  interstitial opacification : lines  nodular opacification : dots 
__label__Breast Parenchymal patterns in breast imaging influence mammographic screening sensitivity and is related to the risk of breast cancer. This article describes the historical classifications of breast density. See the main article on breast density for the currently accepted BI-RADS descriptors.ClassificationPioneers in classification of density include Leborgne in 1953 and Wolfe in 1967, who described an increased risk of breast cancer in radiographically dense breast.Wolfe classificationThe first qualitative classification of mammographic density patterns was described by Wolfe in 1976. Wolfe assigned the mammograms to four parenchymal patterns (N1, P1, P2 and Dy) according to the distribution of fat and the prominence of the ducts:  N1: the breast consists mainly of fat (N = normal)  P1: this pattern includes fat as well as linear densities (enlarged ducts) occupying no more than 25% of the breast  P2: linear densities (from enlarged ducts) occupying more than 25% of the breast. They are prominently in the upper outer quadrant but may be distributed throughout the breast (P=prominent ducts)  Dy: dense, radiopaque breast (Dy=dysplasia); these patterns are again subdivided into low-risk (N1 and P1) and high-risk (P2 and DY) patterns A fifth category was later added by Wolfe: Qdy (quasi-dysplasia): this group consists of young women whose dense breast have a somewhat spongy texture due to fatty infiltrationBoyd classification  An alternative, quantitative method proposed by Boyd and colleagues (1980) was based on mammographic density percentage given by radiologists and divided into six categories of unequal intervals:   A: 0%   B: >0-10%   C: >10-25%   D: >25-50%   E: >50-75%   F: >75% Tabar classification Tabár (1997) classifies the mammograms in five patterns (I to V) based on an histologic-mammographic correlation with a three-dimensional, subgross (thick-slice) technique, and on the relative proportion of four “building blocks” (nodular densities, linear densities, homogeneous fibrous tissue, radiolucent fat tissue):  I: balanced proportion of all components of breast tissue with a slight predominance of fibrous tissue  II: predominance of fat tissue (fat breast)  III: predominance of fat tissue with retroareolar residual fibrous tissue  IV: predominantly nodular densities  V: predominantly fibrous tissue (dense breast) Patterns I, II and III are considered low-risk; patterns IV and V high-risk.It is important to consider that some therapies may alter the pattern by increasing parenchymal density, as in hormone replacement therapy (HRT), or reducing it as in therapies with selective estrogen-receptor modulators (SERM).Prior version of BI-RADS classification of densityThe prior, 4th edition of BI-RADS used a semi-quantitative method proposed by the American College of Radiology (2003) 30. It was a modification of Wolfe’s classification, defined using percentages of density divided into quartiles: almost entirely fat (<25% glandular density) scattered fibroglandular densities (25-50% glandular density) heterogeneously dense (51-75% glandular density) extremely dense (>75% glandular density)

__label__Central __label__Nervous __label__System Parkinson disease (PD), also known as idiopathic parkinsonism, is a neurodegenerative disease and movement disorder characterized by resting tremor, rigidity and hypokinesia due to progressive degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra.  On this page:  Article: Epidemiology Clinical presentation Pathology Radiographic features Treatment and prognosis History and etymology Differential diagnosis Related articles References   Images:Cases and figures  EpidemiologyParkinson disease is by far the most common cause of the parkinsonian syndrome, accounting for approximately 80% of cases (the remainder being due to other neurodegenerative diseases, such as Lewy body dementia) 1. The most common form is encountered in elderly patients and is common, seen in 2-4% of all individuals older than 65 years of age. A juvenile form of Parkinson disease is also recognized, manifesting between 20-40 years of age 1. The majority of cases (85-90%) are sporadic. However, 10-15% of patients have a positive family history 1. Clinical presentationParkinson disease is characterized by both motor and non-motor clinical features. The classic cardinal motor features of Parkinson disease, which are often asymmetric, include:  resting tremor classically 5 Hz 'pill-rolling' resting tremor most prominent in the distal upper limbs   rigidity often described as 'cog-wheel' in nature in the limbs due to superimposed tremor also affects the trunk and contributes to the stooped flexed posture that is often seen   bradykinesia typically decrementing in nature and accompanied by hypokinesia many manifestations: e.g. in the gait, manifests as a festinating and shuffling short-steppage gait, that characteristically has freezing, turning en bloc, and reduced arm swing e.g. in writing, manifests as progressive micrographia e.g. in the face, manifests as hypomimia with decreased eye blinking     postural instability sometimes added as a fourth cardinal feature 3  is generally a late feature   Non-motor features include: constipation: often an early symptom pre-dating the cardinal features anosmia or hyposmia: often an early symptom pre-dating the cardinal features REM sleep behavioral disorder autonomic dysfunction postural hypotension: almost 20% at diagnosis, >1/3 patients by 7 years post diagnosis 17   psychosis, especially visual hallucinations (reported to occur in 6-75% of patients (most reports suggest an incidence of 25-50%), more frequently in patients treated with dopaminergic medication 9,10) bradyphrenia and dementia: generally a late featurein contrast, Lewy body dementia has cognitive impairment either preceding or at most within 12 months of clinical onset of parkinsonian symptoms 2   fatigue and somnolence PathologyThe dopaminergic tract is predominantly affected in Parkinson disease, and histologically, it is characterized by nigrostriatal dopaminergic degeneration leading to neuronal loss in the substantia nigra pars compacta, most conspicuous in the ventrolateral tier of neurons 11. A number of other regions including parts of the basal ganglia, brainstem, autonomic nervous system, and cerebral cortex 3.  At least eleven genes have been implicated in various forms of Parkinson disease 3. Interestingly depending on which genes are involved, various clinical features are more or less prominent (e.g. Kufor-Rakeb syndrome). Even more interestingly not all mutations result in Lewy bodies. For example, juvenile Parkinson disease has been linked to mutations in the PARK2 gene, which encodes for the enzyme ubiquitin ligase-L3. In normal individuals, ubiquitin ligase-L3 is involved in ubiquitination of alpha-synuclein (the main component of Lewy bodies) and allows the formation of Lewy bodies. In patients with juvenile Parkinson disease, its function is impaired, and the formation of Lewy bodies is impossible. This finding suggests that Lewy bodies cannot be thought of as synonymous with, and causative of Parkinson disease. Perhaps even Lewy bodies play a protective role in other forms of Parkinson disease, which manifests 20-40 years later 1. Radiographic featuresInitial imaging findings are subtle and only potentially seen on MRI. With advanced disease, non-specific generalized minor cerebral volume loss can be demonstrated. MRILoss of the normal swallow tail appearance of susceptibility signal pattern in the substantia nigra on axial imaging is perhaps the most promising diagnostic sign 12. Apart from these changes, the signal intensity in substantia nigra depends on loss of neuromelanin and iron accumulation. In addition to aiding diagnosis, MRI is also used to identify features which may indicate secondary parkinsonism rather than primary disease, such as extensive small vessel ischemic change.  Features of Parkinson disease include 1: T1 may show mild hyperintensity of compact and reticular parts of the substantia nigra and red nuclei (due to iron accumulation) 1  may show loss of normal slight hyperintensity in substantia nigra due to loss of neuromelanin 13    T2* (GRE/SWI)   absent swallow tail sign  nigrosome-1 is usually SWI hyperintense, but this is lost in Parkinson disease reported diagnostic accuracy of over 90%, with a 100% sensitivity and negative predictive value, 95% specificity, and 69% positive predictive value being reported in one study 12    may show loss of normal susceptibility signal drop-out of the substantia nigra and red nuclei (due to loss of melanin-containing neurons)dot-like areas of hyperintensity in the compact part of the substantia nigra 1   may show a confluence of the normal hypointense regions of substantia nigra (due to iron accumulation) 1   Recent studies with ultra-high-field MRI (7 T) have shown promising results regarding both sensitivity and specificity 4,5.Nuclear medicineBoth SPECT and PET tracers can be used with high sensitivity for assessment of presynaptic dopaminergic deficits 6,8.I-123 ioflupane SPECTI-123 ioflupane (brand name DaTScan) is taken up by presynaptic dopamine transporters that are abundant in areas rich in axonal synapses form dopaminergic neurons. In the setting of Parkinson disease, the neurons have their cell bodies in the substantia nigra and project axons into the corpus striatum. Imaging with I-123 ioflupane, therefore, demonstrates a lack of normal uptake in the corpus striatum in individuals with Parkinson's disease 16. This appears as a loss of the normal comma-shaped or crescent-shaped tracer uptake in the striatum. Instead, a period-shaped or oval-shaped uptake is seen within the caudate nucleus head without tracer uptake in the putamen. Eventually, even caudate uptake reduces 16.  Quantitative assessment reveals reduced uptake in the putamen compared to norms.Differentiation between Parkinson disease and atypical parkinsonism is also possible, with different tracers 7,8.Treatment and prognosisThe mainstay of treatment is medical. In patients with refractory symptoms, deep brain stimulation may be useful 15. History and etymologyParkinson disease was first described by British physician James Parkinson (1755-1824) in his 1817 seminal work "An Essay on the Shaking Palsy", which was reproduced in its entirety in 2002 by The Journal of Neuropsychiatry and Clinical Neurosciences 14. In this work he describes a 'shaking palsy' as an "involuntary tremulous motion, with lessened muscular power, in parts not in action and even when supported; with a propensity to bend the trunk forward, and to pass from a walking to a running pace; the senses and intellects being uninjured" 14. Remarkably, other than his comment regarding dementia not being a feature of the disease, his original clinical descriptions are still accurate after more than 200 years. Differential diagnosisThere is significant overlap between many neurodegenerative diseases, and Parkinson disease is no exception. Clinically the differential includes 1,3:  dementia with Lewy bodiesdementia is clinically evident before, concurrently or at most within 12 months of onset of parkinsonian symptoms 2   multiple system atrophy (MSA) progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) corticobasal degeneration cerebrovascular disease Perry syndrome postencephalitic parkinsonism  metabolic diseases with parkinsonian signs and symptoms: basal ganglia signal abnormalities are usually more pronounced 1 Wilson disease manganism chronic hepatitis   
__label__Central __label__Nervous __label__System Parkinson-plus syndrome refers to a loose group of neurodegenerative disorders that are characterized by features of Parkinson disease but with other neurological symptoms/signs. They have a poor response to levodopa, and mostly have fairly characteristic neuroimaging features. Conditions included in Parkinson-plus syndrome include 2,4:  progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP)  multisystem atrophy (MSA)  dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB)  cortical-basal ganglionic degeneration (CBGD)  frontotemporal dementia with chromosome 17 (FTDP-17) Pick disease  Parkinsonism-dementia-amyotrophic lateral sclerosis complex (PDALS) The importance of recognizing Parkinson-plus syndrome is that ~25% of patients diagnosed with Parkinson disease end up being diagnosed with a Parkinson-plus syndrome instead 3. Early recognition of features of Parkinson-plus on imaging may help determine an earlier diagnosis and more appropriate treatment. 
__label__Musculoskeletal Parosteal lipomas are rare benign fat-containing tumors closely related to the bone periosteum. On this page:  Article: Epidemiology Clinical presentation Pathology Radiographic features Treatment and prognosis References   Images:Cases and figures  EpidemiologyParosteal lipomas are rare, comprising just 0.3% of all lipomas. They typically occur in 40- to 60-year-old patients. Clinical presentationPatients present with a slowly enlarging, painless soft tissue mass closely related to a bone. Another clinical manifestation is nerve palsy, the most commonly affected nerve being the posterior interosseous nerve. PathologyThe tumor is composed of mature adult fat similar to soft-tissue lipomas. There is often an osseous stalk with cortical thickening. It shows lobular growth with thin intervening septations. There is a lack of malignant potential.LocationThe most common sites are the femoral, radial and humeral diaphysis. Cases have also been reported in the tibia, scapula, clavicle, ribs, pelvis, metacarpals, metatarsals, mandible and skull.Radiographic featuresThe major distinctive radiologic diagnostic feature is a juxtacortical fatty mass with variable septations, containing variable sizes of bony protuberances as well as adjacent cortical thickening.Plain radiographtypically appears as a large, lucent massCT diagnostic for fat density will also demonstrate lack of underlying medullary continuity: to differentiate from osteochondroma  MRIWill present as a T1/T2 hyperintense mass with loss of signal on fat suppression. MRI provides better contrast resolution for fibrovascular septa, which are seen as low-signal-intensity strands on T1-weighted images that become higher in signal intensity on long TR images (in particular fat suppression sequences).MRI also allows for the best evaluation of adjacent nerve involvement and muscle atrophy.Nuclear medicineBone scintigraphy demonstrates increased radiotracer uptake limited to the site of the bony stalk.Treatment and prognosisComplete surgical resection may be performed, particularly in cases with nerve entrapment.

It typically presents in early adulthood and middle age with a peak incidence in the third decade. It affects females slightly more than males 9. Clinical presentationPatients usually present with a painless, slowly enlarging mass 9.PathologyThey are usually located at the metaphysis (80-90%), most commonly at the posterior aspect of the distal femur (60%), followed by either end of the tibia, and then the proximal humerus.They are composed of a dense osteoid component attached to the outer cortex over a narrow zone. Parosteal osteosarcoma originates from the outer fibrous layer of periosteum. It exhibits extensive bone matrix and minimal fibroblastic cellular atypia, and as such is considered to be a low-grade tumor.Radiographic features large lobulated exophytic, 'cauliflower-like' mass with central dense ossification adjacent to the bone  string sign: thin radiolucent line separating the tumor from the cortex, seen in 30% of cases tumor stalk: grows within the tumor in late stages and obliterates the radiolucent cleavage plane +/- soft tissue mass cortical thickening without aggressive periosteal reaction is often seen tumor extension into the medullary cavity is frequently seen MRIIt exhibits predominantly low signal intensity both on T1 and T2 weighted imaging. High signal intensity on T2 is suggestive of a high-grade tumor.Treatment and prognosisParosteal osteosarcomas are usually low-grade lesions are usually treated with surgical resection and no neoadjuvant chemotherapy or radiation. As they are frequently metaphyseal in location, large parosteal osteosarcomas or those with deep medullary invasion may require limb salvage, including joint replacement.Parosteal osteosarcomas have an excellent prognosis (80-95% long-term survival). Differential diagnosisOn imaging consider  cortical desmoid: avulsive injury of the posterior femoral cortex  myositis ossificans: the ossification pattern of parosteal OS is the radiographic inverse of that seen in myositis ossificans, with the densest ossification in the center of the lesion and the least radiopaque bone at the periphery (eggshell pattern); there is also often a history of trauma, progressive decrease in size or constant size and significant edema in early stages on MRI. sessile osteochondroma: parosteal OS lacks corticomedullary continuity between the tumor and the underlying medullary canal. juxtacortical chondrosarcoma high-grade surface osteosarcoma  parosteal lipoma: radiolucent mass adjacent to the cortical surface on plain film and on cross-sectional imaging will usually show a definite fat component 2

__label__Head __label__& __label__Neck The parotid gland is the largest of the salivary glands and secretes saliva via the parotid duct into the oral cavity to facilitate mastication and swallowing. It is located in the parotid space.  On this page:  Article: Gross anatomy Blood supply Lymphatic drainage Innervation Variant anatomy Radiographic appearance Related pathology Related articles References   Images:Cases and figures  Gross anatomyThe parotid gland is wrapped around the mandibular ramus and extends to a position anterior and inferior to the ear. It has superficial and deep lobes, separated by the facial nerve.The facial nerve and its branches pass through the parotid gland, as does the external carotid artery and retromandibular vein. The external carotid artery forms its two terminal branches within the parotid gland: maxillary and superficial temporal artery.The gland usually contains several intraparotid lymph nodes. These lymph nodes are the first station of lymphatic drainage of the skin of the pinna and peri-auricular skin.A fibrous capsule surrounds the gland, formed by the superficial (investing) layer of the deep cervical fascia, creating the parotid space. Posteriorly, this fascia condenses to form the stylomandibular ligament.The inferior projection of the parotid is often referred to as the "tail", which overlies the angle of the mandible. The tail is not distinct from the rest of the gland, but it has been defined as the inferior 2 cm of the gland 11.Anteriorly, there is often an accessory parotid gland, which may be separate from the main gland.There is fatty infiltration or fatty replacement of the parotid glands with age 6.Relations superior pole: external acoustic meatus, temporomandibular joint  lower pole: behind the angle of the mandible, anterior to the sternocleidomastoid and posterior belly of the digastric  lateral surface: subcutaneous tissue anterior surface: clasps the ramus of the mandible with the masseter on its outer surface and medial pterygoid on its inner surface inferiorly (separated by the stylomandibular ligament) anterior border: formed by the lateral edge of the anterior surface where it meets the masseter the parotid duct and five facial nerve branches emerge from this border from the deeper part, the superficial temporal and maxillary arteries leave the gland   deep surface: indented by the mastoid process and its attached muscles (sternocleidomastoid and posterior belly of the digastric), styloid process and its attached muscles (stylohyoid, styloglossus, stylopharyngeus) and two ligaments (stylomandibular, stylohyoid) the external carotid artery enters the gland through this surface   the styloid process separates the gland from the internal jugular vein and internal carotid artery  the temporozygomatic and cervicofacial branches of the facial nerve enter the gland between the mastoid and styloid processes 8    Blood supply  arterial: external carotid artery and a specific branch of the artery, the transverse facial artery   venous drainage: plexus of veins into the internal jugular vein  Lymphatic drainageIntraparotid nodes drain into the deep cervical chain. Innervation sensory: auriculotemporal nerve, greater auricular nerve parasympathetic: via auriculotemporal nerve sympathetic: via plexus surrounding external carotid artery from superior cervical ganglion.  Variant anatomy  accessory parotid gland  facial process: anterior extension of glandular tissue along the parotid duct continuous with the main gland ectopic parotid tissue parotid duct duplication 7  congenital agenesis: either unilateral and bilateral 10  Radiographic appearanceUltrasound is often the first diagnostic procedure to evaluate morphological and structural changes of the parotid gland; for small (<3 cm) and superficial lesions, ultrasound and cytology are often sufficient for a definitive diagnosis 2.Ultrasound appears homogeneous with increased echogenicity compared to nearby muscle 1  intraparotid lymph nodes are normally seen (unlike the submandibular gland)  retromandibular vein and external carotid artery are also easily seen and by inference the facial nerve, which lies lateral to these vessels 1  limitations of ultrasound are: difficulty visualizing deep lesions: the deep lobe is not able to be assessed as it is protected by the mandibular ramus difficulty visualizing deep extension 3    CT/MRI CT and MRI provide useful additional diagnostic imaging if malignancy is suspected 4, with the sensitivity approaching 100% for detecting parotid neoplasms 5  the parotid duct and retromandibular vein are usually seen and approximate the plane separating the superficial and deep lobes 12  Related pathology  parotid enlargement salivary gland tumors cystic parotid lesions   parotitis sialolithiasis

On this page:  Article: Terminology Epidemiology Clinical presentation Pathology Radiographic features Treatment and prognosis References   Images:Cases and figures  TerminologyThe term comes from a mistaken 19th century belief that the hemolysis and subsequent hemoglobinuria occurred only intermittently (paroxysmally) and with greater frequency during the night (nocturnal). Hemoglobinuria is most prominent in the morning after the urine has concentrated overnight during sleep but hemolysis in paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria is a constant process.EpidemiologyPrevalence is low, at 1-10 per 1,000,000. No difference in prevalence between  the sexes has been found, M:F = 1:1. Median age at diagnosis is in the fourth decade 2.Clinical presentation anemia profound fatigue stress dyspnea hemoglobinuria dysphagia abdominal pain erectile dysfunction ComplicationsCommon thrombosis renal impairment pulmonary hypertension Rare bone marrow failure myelodysplasia acute leukemia renal hemosiderosis avascular necrosis of the hip PathologyParoxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria is caused by a defect in surface proteins of red blood cells, typically due to an acquired mutation in the PIGA gene on the X chromosome in a hematopoietic stem cell 1,7. These surface proteins usually protect red blood cells and other immune cells from destruction via the complement system, thus a defect in these proteins increases their destruction, leading to the aforementioned clinical presentation 1.In addition to the anemia from hemolysis, patients suffer from the direct effects of intravascular hemolysis that results in the absorption of nitric oxide, a key molecule in homeostasis, leading to smooth muscle dysfunction and platelet activation, markedly raising the risk of thrombosis 1.Radiographic featuresUltrasound, CT and MRI may show features of thrombosis of major vessels, particularly in the abdomen.Rarely thrombosis of smaller vessels may cause osteonecrosis of the femoral head.Treatment and prognosis blood transfusions anticoagulation bone marrow transplant 1  eculizumab 1  Without therapy approximately 50% of patients die as a direct result of the disease. Many others are transfusion dependent for decades 3.Pregnancy results in extremely high risk for maternal and fetal mortality, predominantly resulting from thrombotic complications 4.Eculizumab has been shown by recent data to prevent most of the complications and significantly improves survival 2,5,6.

Patients from 3 months to 85 years old have been reported, but the majority are between 3rd to 7th decade of life.Clinical presentationThe presentation is typically quite sudden, with an onset of a painful shoulder girdle and progressive weakness. Symptoms are however non-specific and can mimic numerous other much more common conditions such as cervical spondylosis, labral tear with paralabral cyst and other suprascapular notch masses, rotator cuff deficiency, shoulder impingement, calcific tendonitis and adhesive capsulitis 1-2.The findings are unilateral in two-thirds of cases. Bilateral involvement is reported.A combination of history, EMG (which demonstrates denervation changes, especially of the suprascapular nerve) and imaging make the diagnosis. PathologyThe etiology is uncertain, although localized infectious (viral) or immunological process is suspected. In almost all cases (97%) the suprascapular nerve is involved and is the only nerve involved in 50% of cases 2. The axillary nerve and subscapular nerve are also sometimes involved, either in combination or alone. The most frequently involved muscles are supraspinatus and infraspinatus (innervated by suprascapular nerve) followed by deltoid (innervated by axillary nerve). Radiographic featuresMRIThe most striking features on MRI are denervation changes in muscles. Initially, the muscle appears normal. Over the next few weeks, high T2 signal develops. Gradually, especially in patients with a protracted course, atrophy and fatty infiltration will develop with the increase in T1 signal and decreased muscle bulk. Treatment and prognosisThe condition is typically self-limiting with supportive therapy only being required. Weakness may persist for many years although 90% of patients will have an excellent recovery by three years 2.History and etymologyThis syndrome was first described in 1943 by Spillane 4 but popularized with a larger series in 1948 by Parsonage and Turner 3:  Maurice John Parsonage, neurologist: UK  John W Aldren Turner, neurologist: London, UK Differential diagnosisDifferential diagnosis on MR findings includes 1-2: disuse atrophy of shoulder girdle muscles quadrilateral space syndrome other entrapment syndromes around the shouldermass in the suprascapular notch (e.g. ganglion)  trauma 
__label__Central __label__Nervous __label__System The pars opercularis refers to the vertically oriented fold of the inferior frontal gyrus in the frontal lobe of the brain. It is the most caudal of the three cortical segments that form the inferior frontal gyrus along with the pars triangularis and the pars orbitalis in a caudorostral direction. It is most commonly affiliated with Broca’s area when paired with the pars triangularis which plays a significant role in the production of speech 4-7. On this page:  Article: Gross anatomy Radiographic features Function Related articles References   Images:Cases and figures  Gross anatomyRelationsThe pars opercularis is delimited rostrally by the ascending ramus of the lateral sulcus separating it from the pars triangularis. It is delimited caudally by the inferior precentral sulcus separating it from the precentral gyrus. The inferior frontal sulcus which originates close to the inferior precentral sulcus makes up the dorsal boundary of the pars opercularis delineating it from the middle frontal gyrus 4-7.  Blood supplyIt is supplied by the frontal branches of the middle cerebral artery.Variant anatomyAn additional sulcus called the diagonal sulcus which subdivides the pars opercularis into rostral and caudal segments may be identified in some brains. It may be distinguishable as a separate sulcus or blend with any of the surrounding sulci depending on the variable curvature of the pars opercularis and how much of it remains on the surface of the brain. A variable extent of the caudal segment submerges into the inferior precentral sulcus 4,5.Radiographic featuresRadiographically the pars opercularis can be identified as the most caudal vertically oriented portion of the inferior frontal gyrus which takes on a characteristic “M” configuration. This is also referred to as the M sign when identifying the inferior frontal gyrus3.FunctionThe pars opercularis corresponds to the area of cortex that is associated with Brodmann’s area 44 in the dominant hemisphere. Traditionally, together with Brodmann’s area 45 (a.k.a. pars triangularis), it is considered to constitute the classical Broca’s area. There is no clear functional segregation between areas 44 and 45. Broca’s area is well documented in its involvement in aspects of language and comprehension. Brodmann’s area 44 has also demonstrated some motor functions due to its interactions with neighboring premotor areas. The same cortical region in the non-dominant hemisphere is involved in non-verbal communication such as gesticulation, facial expression and modulation of timing and intonation of speech 1,2,7.

The uterus is often large for gestational age, and fetal heart beat is usually absent. PathologyIt is characterized by its focal distribution, slower transformation, the presence of an embryo or fetus, and a triploid karyotype (70% are 69 XXY, 27% are 69 XXX, and 3% are 69 XYY). The extra set of chromosomes are often of paternal origin 7.Radiographic featuresUltrasoundDefinitive diagnosis by ultrasound is often difficult. Described sonographic features include 1,3: greatly enlarged placenta relative to the size of the uterine cavity cystic spaces within the placenta ("molar placenta"), which may not always be present an amniotic cavity (gestational sac), either empty or containing amorphous inappropriately small fetal echoes which may be surrounded by a relatively thick rim of placental echoes with intermingling cystic spaces presence of a well-formed but growth-retarded fetus, either dead or alive with hydropic degeneration of fetal parts being frequently present some partial moles can have sonographic appearances indistinguishable from those of the common complete moles or missed abortions 3, although an echogenic rim around the sac, as found in missed abortion or blighted ovum, is notably absent color Doppler interrogation may show high velocity and low impedance flow CTCT evaluation is not usually performed given its low resolution for the uterine assessment. CT may show an enlarged uterus with areas of low attenuation, or hypoattenuating foci surrounded by highly enhanced areas in the myometrium.MRIMRI can be used to determine if there is an extension of molar tissue outside the uterus. Treatment and prognosisWhen a partial mole is suspected and there is a live fetus, counseling and genetic tests looking for triploidy should be offered (chorionic villus sampling or amniocentesis). Suction and curettage are used for evacuation.Differential diagnosisConsiderations on early ultrasound scans include:  fetal demise with placental hydropic change: beta HCG levels are invariably low in this case twin pregnancy with one normal twin and one complete hydatidiform mole: the normal twin usually has its own normal placenta placental mesenchymal dysplasia See also triploidy complete hydatidiform mole

It is thought to be hormonally mediated by relaxin and progesterone 2. Physiologic peripartum symphyseal widening ranges from 3-7 mm and often remains asymptomatic. Slight pubic diastasis in the absence of clinical symptoms is frequent and does not necessitate medical treatment. After delivery, laxity of these ligaments gradually diminishes, the pubic diastalsis disappears, and pelvic stability is restored.Treatment and prognosisTreatment of postpartum symphyseal rupture has traditionally been non-operative and conservative 5,6. Bed rest, usually in a decubitus position, analgesics and the application of a pelvic binder to facilitate reduction of the diastalsis are sufficient to ensure full recovery in most case. The successful surgical treatment of the chronic postpartum pelvic pain usually is anterior pubic fixation with or without sacroiliac joint stabilization.The occurrence of a symphyseal separation should not significantly alter the management of subsequent pregnancies, and conservative therapy is recommended for any recurrence of symptoms.

__label__Musculoskeletal The patella (plural: patellae)  is the largest sesamoid bone in the human body. It lies within the quadriceps tendon/patellar tendon and forms part of the knee joint and extensor mechanism of the knee. On this page:  Article: Gross anatomy Arterial supply Venous drainage Innervation Variant anatomy Related pathology Related articles References   Images:Cases and figures  Gross anatomyOsteologyThe patella is triangular in shape with a superior base and inferior apex. The proximal three-quarters of the posterior surface is smooth, composed of articular cartilage, which is the thickest in the body, as much as 5 mm in some adults. The distal pole of the posterior surface of the patella does not functionally form part of the joint and is denuded of cartilage 7. The posterior surface is divided into medial and lateral facets by a vertical ridge. The medial most portion of the medial facet lacks articular cartilage and is known as the odd facet 7,8.The anterior surface is rough, for attachment of tendons and ligaments.The ossification centers of the patella appear between 3 and 6 years. They fuse at puberty, with higher levels of physical activity.ArticulationsThe medial and lateral facets of the patella are covered in hyaline cartilage and articulate with the medial and lateral condyles of the femur, respectively, to form the patellofemoral component of the knee joint. Some authors describe the medial facet as having superior, middle, inferior and lateral portions and the lateral facet as having superior, middle and inferior portions (subfacets) 4. The lateral facet is larger than the medial, which allows for side identification when the bone is placed posterior surface down on a flat surface 5.AttachmentsMusculotendinous and ligamentousThe patella serves for attachment of the quadriceps tendon (superiorly) and the patellar tendon (ligament) (which attaches to the tibial tubercle, inferiorly), although few quadriceps tendon fibers are continuous over the anterior surface.  The quadriceps tendon and patellar tendon are really the same structure with the patella (as a sesamoid bone) embedded within it.The medial and lateral patellar retinaculum, which are condensations of fascia rather than true ligaments, attach the patella margins to surrounding fascia. The medial patellar retinaculum attaches to the vastus medialis / sartorius fascia and is often disrupted in lateral patellar dislocation. The lateral patellar retinaculum is attached to the fascia of vastus lateralis and iliotibial band 3.The quadricep muscles pulls the patella obliquely and laterally in relation to the femur. There are factors that prevent such displacement: larger lateral condyle of the femur, tension in the medial retinacular fibers and direction of insertion of fibers of the vastus medialis muscle.The medial patellofemoral ligament (MPFL) originates near adductor tubercle of the femur and inserts into the superomedial aspect of the patella. Its function is to prevent lateral patellar dislocation during knee extension.Relations  superior: quadriceps tendon, suprapatellar bursa  inferior: patellar tendon, infrapatellar bursa, infrapatellar fat pad  lateral: lateral patellar retinaculum  medial: medial patellar retinaculum  posterior: knee joint, femur  anterior: prepatellar bursa Arterial supplyArterial blood enters via the anterior surface of the patella and an anastomotic patella ring is formed supplied by the paired superior and inferior geniculate arteries as well as the anterior tibial recurrent artery 2.Venous drainageIn general the draining veins are the counterparts to the aforementioned arteries. In addition there is a complementary system of veins running deep to the articular cartilage forming a subarticular drainage network  9.Innervationbranches of nerves to vastus medialis and vastus lateralis 6 Variant anatomy bipartite patella multipartite patella absent patella variation in shape (see: Wiberg classification)  dorsal defect of the patella (may occasionally be symptomatic) Related pathology patella fracture lateral patellar dislocation patellar instability patella baja patella alta chondromalacia patellae nail-patella syndrome patella sleeve syndrome patellar tendon rupture patellar tumor 
__label__Musculoskeletal Patella alta, or a high riding patella, describes a situation where the position of the patella is considered high. It may be idiopathic or may result secondary to a patellar tendon rupture. EpidemiologyAssociationsSeveral conditions are known to be associated with patella alta, including: idiopathic retropatellar pain 5  recurrent dislocation of the patella 2   chondromalacia patellae 2  knee joint effusion 2  Patella alta may also occur as a result of spastic cerebral palsy 6.Radiographic featuresOn sagittal images, it is usually considered when the Insall-Salvati ratio is greater than 1.3-1.5 1-3.On radiography, it is important that standard positioning is used, with the knee flexed at 30 degrees. An off-angle x-ray beam or non-standard positioning may result in a spuriously abnormal ratio.
__label__Musculoskeletal Patella baja (or patella infera) is an abnormally low lying patella, which is associated with restricted range of motion, crepitations, and retropatellar pain. If longstanding, extensor dysfunction may ensue with significant morbidity. On this page:  Article: Pathology Radiographic features Treatment and prognosis Related articles References   Images: Cases and figures Imaging differential diagnosis   PathologyIt is seen in a variety of clinical scenarios including 1: quadriceps dysfunction: poliomyelitis tourniquet paralysis   bony or ligamentous trauma: fractures osteotomies tibial tubercle transplant ACL repair total knee replacement: seen in 25% of patients 1     achondroplasia: usually asymptomaticRadiographic featuresA number of methods for determining patella height have been devised: Insall-Salvati ratio Blackburne-Peel ratio Norman, Egund and Ekelund method Caton-Linclau method Blumensaat technique It is important in the setting of previous surgery to ensure that the patella has not been resected, as a change in patellar morphology will clearly affect the ratio 1.Treatment and prognosisTraumatic/post-surgical patella baja is frequently symptomatic and requires early surgical correction as conservative measures are rarely successful. Treatment requires either a tibial tuberosity osteotomy and re-implantation proximally or patellar tendon lengthening.

__label__Musculoskeletal __label__Trauma Patella fracture is one of the common knee injuries usually post direct trauma to the patella or sudden forceful contraction of the quadriceps muscles in the context of a sports injury. On this page:  Article: Epidemiology Clinical presentation Pathology Treatment and prognosis Differential diagnosis Related articles References   Images: Cases and figures Imaging differential diagnosis   EpidemiologyFractures of the patella represent ~1% all fractures, and are most common in those aged 20-50 years. Two-thirds of cases are in males 7.Clinical presentationPatients present with marked swelling and pain over the patella with point tenderness and marked reduction in extension strength. Usually, there is a large joint effusion or hemarthrosis.Complications stiffness weak extensor mechanism degenerative disease of the patellofemoral joint PathologyEtiologyThere are different causes of patella fracture: direct blow to patella, e.g. dashboard injury (high energy) or fall onto the patella (low energy) severe forces by extensor mechanism after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction  after total knee reconstruction  pathological fracture In practice, often both direct and indirect mechanisms are important, e.g. a direct trauma coupled with forceful contraction of the quadriceps 7.Morphology  transverse fracture of mid patella (most common) comminuted fracture vertical fracture (least common)  osteochondral defect usually from medial facet  patellar sleeve fracture in children Some fractures are more subtle and need to be differentiated from normal variants.Treatment and prognosisTreatment is determined by the amount of displacement of the fracture and whether the extensor mechanism of the knee is intact or disrupted.For patients with a non displaced or minimally displaced fracture and an intact extensor mechanism non operative treatment may be suitable. This usually involved a Zimmer knee splint for 4-6 weeks. The patient is usually allowed to weight bear in the splint during this period 6.In the case of displaced fractures or disrupted extensor mechanism, surgical management is usually required 6. The surgical treatment of these fractures usually involves tension band wiring (K wire technique).Differential diagnosisThe main differential is of multipartite patella, where there is a failure of fusion of secondary ossification centers. The unfused fragments are almost always in the superolateral quadrant of the patella. With a multipartite patella, the volume of the true patella plus that of the smaller ossification centers is greater than that expected of a normal patella. With a patellar fracture, the volume of the fractured components is equivalent to that of a normal patella.Rarely a traumatic separation of a multipartite patella may occur 7.
__label__Musculoskeletal __label__Paediatrics __label__Trauma Patellar sleeve fractures (also commonly, patellar sleeve avulsion fracture) represent chondral or osteochondral avulsion injury commonly at the inferior pole of the patella (including cartilage from the articular surface, as well as periosteum and cartilage over the dorsal surface).Very rarely it can involve the upper pole 5.This is an important diagnosis as the displaced bone-forming tissue will continue to grow and ossify, enlarging and possibly duplicating the patella. On this page:  Article: Epidemiology Clinical presentation Radiographic features Treatment and prognosis Differential diagnosis Related articles References   Images: Cases and figures Imaging differential diagnosis   EpidemiologyPatellar sleeve fractures occur in the pediatric population between 8 and 16 years of age, with a peak incidence at 12.7 years, predominantly boys (3:1). Adolescents are more susceptible due to rapid growth, increased sports activity, and relative patella instability.Clinical presentationUnlike Sinding-Larsen-Johansson disease, these injuries are acute and result from sudden and forceful contraction of quadriceps muscle (indirect mechanism). Acute focal pain and tenderness occur at the time of the injury, and a palpable gap may be present.Radiographic featuresPlain radiographLateral knee x-rays demonstrate swelling at the lower pole of the patella and some degree of patella alta. If a small bony fragment has been avulsed with the cartilage, then this too may be seen. A joint effusion may not be present.UltrasoundUltrasound may be helpful in the absence of a radiographically visible fracture fragment. A disruption of the cartilage may be seen, and the degree of separation estimated. Ancillary findings of soft tissue edema, fluid, and hyperemia may be helpful.MRIMRI is critical if the diagnosis is suspected as the degree of chondral injury cannot be assessed on plain radiography, and coexistent extensor mechanism injury may be present.Treatment and prognosisSurgical treatment is recommended when there is significant displacement (>2 mm) of the displaced osteo/chondral fragment.Differential diagnosis  Sinding-Larsen-Johansson disease: chronic  jumper's knee: chronic and seen in adults  Osgood-Schlatter disease: chronic and affects the inferior attachment of the patellar tendon patella fracture quadriceps tendon rupture 
__label__Musculoskeletal The patellar tendon, also - less correctly - referred to as the patellar ligament, attaches the patella to the tibia and is part of the extensor mechanism of the knee.

It measures approximately 5 cm in length (i.e. height of the patella) and 20-30 mm in width, being wider proximally and narrower distally, and is 4-6 mm thick 2-4.OriginThe patellar tendon begins at the patellar apex, but is actually considered the distal part of the quadriceps tendon - or, more accurately, a continuation of the rectus femoris tendon over the patella - while the patella itself is a sesamoid bone embedded in the quadriceps tendon 1,2.InsertionTibial tuberosity (tubercle).RelationsIt is bounded posteriorly by the infrapatellar (Hoffa) fat pad.Blood supplyThe patellar tendon is supplied by the following arteries and their anastomoses 3: descending genicular artery, a branch of the deep femoral artery  inferior medial genicular artery, a branch of the popliteal artery  superior and inferior lateral genicular arteries, branches of the popliteal artery anterior tibial recurrent artery, a branch of the anterior tibial artery  ActionAssists in proper patellar alignment and knee extension.Variant anatomyVariation of >20% between the patellar tendon length and patellar height will result in either 4  patella alta: tendon longer than patella  patella baja: tendon shorter than patella Radiographic featuresUltrasoundShows striated appearance with predominantly high echogenicity, similarly to any other tendon.

__label__Musculoskeletal Patellar tendon-lateral femoral condyle friction syndrome, also known as Hoffa fat pad impingement syndrome, is a common cause of anterior knee pain in active individuals. It is thought to be due to patellar maltracking or imbalance of the forces between medial and lateral vastus muscles causing impingement of the superolateral aspect of Hoffa fat pad between the inferior patella and the lateral femoral condyle.Clinical presentationPatients present with anterior knee pain exacerbated by hyperextension, and with point tenderness at the inferior pole of the patella. The fat pad is thickened which may make palpating the patella difficult 1.Radiographic featuresIt is usually occult on plain radiographs and CT.MRIFocal area of high T2 signal (edema) at the inferolateral aspect of the patellofemoral joint, within the superolateral portion of the infrapatellar fat pad. A cystic lesion can sometimes be found between the lateral femoral condyle and the lateral retinaculum. Associated findings include lateral patellar subluxation and patella alta (Insall-Salvati ratio greater than 1.2) which are found in around 90% of cases 1,2.
__label__Musculoskeletal Patellar tendon rupture  is one of the extensor mechanism of the knee injuries and occurs almost invariably at either the patellar or tibial insertion of the patellar tendon, when in the setting of trauma, and is often associated with a small avulsion fracture. Most commonly, it is at the superior attachment to the inferior pole of the patella. When secondary to systemic illness, then mid-substance tears are more frequent.Patellar tendon rupture is less frequent than a patellar fracture and a quadriceps tendon rupture, and tends to occur in a younger population.Predisposing factors include: chronic microtrauma (tendinopathy): also known as jumper's knee  prior therapeutic intervention direct injection of steroids (for treatment of jumper's knee) previous ACL repair    systemic illness chronic renal faliure diabetes mellitus rheumatoid arthritis (RA) systemic lupus erythemtosus (SLE) calcium pyrophosphate deposition disease (CPPD)    Radiographic featuresPlain radiograph/MRIOn imaging, a complete rupture is usually easily identified, due to significant patella alta where there is an increased Insall-Salvati ratio.Other features include blurring of the posterior margin of the patella tendon into Hoffa's fat pad and presence of an avulsion fracture.UltrasoundBest imaged with longitudinal scans using high-frequency linear transducers; the tendon normally appears as a continuous well-defined hyperechoic fibrillar structure bridging the patella and the tibial tuberosity while tears usually appear as hypoechoic areas of interruption of the fibrillar pattern 1.Treatment and prognosisEarly surgical repair may be necessary to ensure good functional outcome.
__label__Musculoskeletal Patellar translation can be measured using the tibial-tuberosity to trochlear groove distance (TT-TG distance) by calclating the transverse length between the trochlear groove on the femoral and tibial tuberosity on axial images.

__label__Musculoskeletal Patellofemoral instability is the clinical syndrome due to morphologic abnormalities in the patellofemoral joint where the patella is prone to recurrent lateral dislocation. On this page:  Article: Epidemiology Pathology Radiographic features Treatment and prognosis Related articles References   Images:Cases and figures  EpidemiologyMost patients with patellar instability are young and active individuals, especially females in the second decade. Prevalence is 6-77 per 100,000 population 2.PathologyThe normal patellofemoral joint has two kinds of stabilizers - active stabilizers (extensor muscles) and passive stabilizers (bones and ligaments): bone stabilizers: deep femoral sulcus, high lateral trochlea ligament stabilizers: medial patellofemoral retinaculum, medial patellofemoral ligament  Three major morphologic abnormalities which predispose to patellar instability:  trochlear dysplasia: trochlear joint surface is flattened patella alta lateralization of the tibial tuberosity: femorotibial malrotation, genu recurvatum  Other factors contributing to patellar instability are increased femoral anteversion  ligament or retinaculum injury or laxity (Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, Marfan syndrome) abnormal muscle tone The most common mechanism of first-time patellar dislocation is internal rotation of the femur relative to the knee (i.e. exorotation of the tibia relative to the femur) while the foot is planted and the knee is flexed.Radiographic featuresPlain radiographThe "crossing sign" represents abnormally elevated floor of the trochlear groove rising above the top of the wall of one of the femoral condyles, assessed on lateral radiographs. "Double contour sign" is a double line at the anterior aspect of condyles, and seen if medial condyle is hypoplastic. Skyline view can show decreased trochlear depth and large sulcus angle (>144º).MRILateral trochlear inclination, trochlear facet asymmetry, and trochlear depth are used to judge trochlear dysplasia.Classification of trochlear dysplasia (Dejour et al)  type A: normal shape of the trochlea, but a shallow trochlear groove  type B: markedly flattened or even convex trochlea  type C: trochlear facet asymmetry, with too high lateral facet, and hypoplastic medial facet  type D: type C features and a vertical link between facets ('cliff pattern') 3  Lateral trochlear inclinationThe most superior section showing trochlear cartilage is selected for this measurement. The inclination is the angle formed between the plane of the lateral trochlear facet subchondral bone and a tangential line through posterior femoral condyles. An angle of <11º is considered abnormal.Trochlear facet asymmetryThis is the ratio of medial trochlear facet width to lateral trochlear facet width and measured in the axial plane. A ratio of <0.4 is considered abnormal (i.e. it is abnormal if the medial facet is <40% the width of the lateral facet).  Trochlear depthThis measures the inset depth of the trochlear groove (sulcus) relative to the mean of the medial and lateral femoral condyle outsets.  It is determined by axial imaging at the same level as the trochlear facet asymmetry. A trochlear depth of <3 mm is considered abnormal. Patella altaPatella alta (or a high riding patella) describes a situation where the position of the patella is considered high. See patella alta article for a description of the Insall-Salvati ratio.Patellar translationPatellar translation, known as the TT-TG distance (tibial tubercle to trochlear groove distance) is currently advocated as an accurate measure of patellar instability. The distance from the tibial tuberosity to the trochlear groove is measured parallel to the tangential line through posterior femoral condyles:  <15 mm is considered normal 15-20 mm is considered borderline >20 mm is considered abnormal The distance has been shown to be slightly less when measured on MRI than CT 4.Associated radiological features of patellar instability knee joint effusion  medial patellofemoral ligament tear  bone contusion in the patella and lateral condyle  osteochondral defects in the patella edema/hemorrhage of vastus medialis intra-articular loose bodies internal derangement of the knee Treatment and prognosisNearly half of the patients with first-time dislocation will sustain recurrent dislocation after conservative management. Chronic patellar instability, if not treated, may lead to severe arthritis and chondromalacia patellae.

Obscuration of the aortopulmonary window and features of pulmonary edema may be evident.EchocardiographyTransesophageal and transthoracic echocardiography have been used to identify these lesions, assess for the presence of complications, and plan surgical intervention. Suspicion is often aroused when a measured shunt fraction (Qp:Qs) is > 1.0, consistent with a left-to-right shunt.With transthoracic echocardiography, the parasternal short axis view at the level of the aortic valve with color flow Doppler allows visualization of the flow through a patent ductus arteriosus. It classically appears as a high-velocity jet directed from the far-field toward the main pulmonary artery. Continuous wave Doppler interrogation reveals continuous flow throughout systole and diastole. Larger lesions, especially with concomitant pulmonary hypertension, may demonstrate lower flow velocities and/or alternating flow direction.The suprasternal notch view may also depict aliased, continuous flow from the proximal descending aorta toward the right pulmonary artery, visible under the aortic arch in short-axis.CTMDCT can non-invasively provide detailed anatomical information 1.Krichenko classification based on CT angiography: type A: conical ductus, prominent aortic ampulla with narrowing at pulmonary artery end type B: window, short and wide ductus with blending of pulmonary artery type C: long tubular ductus with no constrictions type D: multiple constrictions with complex ductus type E: elongated ductus with remote constriction A ductus may have a tortuous morphology that does not fit in the Krichenko classification. This ductus type is usually observed in premature children and some authors proposed to classify it as type F or fetal type.

__label__Cardiac A patent foramen ovale (PFO) is a type of atrial septal defect in which there is channel-like communication between the atria through an unfused fossa ovale. On this page:  Article: Gross anatomy Pathology Radiographic features Treatment and prognosis Related articles References   Images:Cases and figures  Gross anatomyThe foramen ovale in the interatrial septum normally develops into the fossa ovalis when the flaps of the atrial septa primum and secundum normally fuse during development. The foramen ovale remains patent if there is incompletely fusion. This variant occurs in 25-33% of adults 1,2. The prevalence may decrease with advancing age.Patent foramen ovales/foramina ovalia are subdivided into: probe-patent foramen ovale patent foramen ovale A "probe patent" foramen ovale is defined as a defect in the fossa ovalis that would be revealed with instrument probing.PathologyA patent foramen ovale has been associated with paradoxical embolism and ischemic stroke because of the potential for a venous thromboembolism to pass from the right atrium to the systemic circulation, bypassing the lungs.PFOs are small enough to be haemodynamically insignificant.Radiographic featuresTransesophageal echocardiography may be detected on a "bubble study" (IV injection of agitated saline); the contrast material appears in the left atrium before the normal time the significance of the shunt through a PFO often estimated as a function of the number of bubbles directly visualized passing from the right to left atrium severe shunt present when more than 30 bubbles (25 is the TTE cutoff) are seen crossing the IAS   best assessed from a bicaval view (mid esophageal level, 90 degree view) interatrial septum appears in near field, with the confluence of the superior and inferior vena cavae into the right atrium in the far field color flow doppler applied across interatrial septum to assess for PFO or secundum ASD  if possible, a valsalva maneuver is performed (also possible with transthoracic echocardiography as a supplement), which is crucial to elicit right to left shunting    if visualized, the maximum discontinuity between the primum and secundum should be measured (valsalva phase IV)defects > 4 mm considered severe, <2 mm considered small 5   Cardiac CT abnormal communication of contrast material between the atria through a channel-like tunnel in the interatrial septum a channel-like tunnel alone is a normal variant of the fossa ovalis, and is not diagnostic Contrast-enhanced cardiac MRInot a first-line study, but may be diagnosed by visual assessment or computation of signal–time curves in the pulmonary vein and the left atrium 3 A patent foramen ovale can be differentiated from an atrial septal defect because a PFO takes a tunneled intraseptal course, or with the presence of a flap valve on the left atrial side of the foramen 2. Treatment and prognosisClosure devices, both surgically open and percutaneous, have been developed and are currently implemented in some centers for PFO.
__label__Interventional Patent track sign is a finding on color Doppler ultrasound, representing blood traveling along the course a biopsy needle track. It can occur after a biopsy of any organ, but is more often seen after liver or kidney biopsies.Radiographic findings linear color Doppler flow along the course of a biopsy needle trackthe color Doppler flow is often disorganized  the track often extends out of the organ into an adjacent hematoma spectral Doppler tracings of the track have not been found to be predictive of the severity of the hemorrhage Treatment and prognosisVisualization of the sign is associated with risk factors for post biopsy bleeding. According to one source, the patent track sign can be seen in 12% of liver biopsies 1, but the significance of seeing a patent track sign has unclear prognostic implications. The patent track often resolves after five minutes of post biopsy compression. If it continues after 5 minutes, this is associated with subsequent post biopsy bleeding.
__label__Urogenital __label__Paediatrics A patent urachus is one of the spectrum of congenital urachal anomalies. It has occasionally been termed "urachal fistula". On this page:  Article: Clinical presentation Pathology Radiographic features Related articles References   Images:Cases and figures  Clinical presentationA patent urachus is often diagnosed in neonates when urine is noted leaking from the umbilicus. The umbilicus may also have an abnormal appearance on physical exam.If the patent urachus is very narrow, it may present later in life if high pressures in the bladder develop (e.g. bladder outlet obstruction), forcing urine through the patent urachus.A patent urachus predisposes to infection.PathologyA patent urachus represents the failure of the entire course of the fetal allantois to involute into the median umbilical ligament. This results in an open channel between the bladder and the umbilicus.Radiographic featuresContrast studies (VCUG)A patent urachus can be demonstrated by: retrograde injection of contrast material into the orifice of the channel at the umbilical end reflux up the urachus during VCUG (better seen in the lateral projection) UltrasoundA patent urachus can be seen on longitudinal ultrasound images of the midline ventral abdomen as a tubular connection between the anterosuperior aspect of the bladder and the umbilicus.
__label__Oncology __label__Musculoskeletal Pathological fractures are fractures that occur in abnormal bone. On this page:  Article: Terminology Pathology Treatment and prognosis Practical points Related articles References   Images:Cases and figures  TerminologyThe term pathological fracture is usually reserved for malignancies, either benign or malignant, although it has been used in the setting of osteomyelitis. It can be used in the setting of generalized metabolic bone disease (e.g. Paget disease, osteopetrosis), although the term insufficiency fracture is probably more correct 4. PathologyLocationThe most common location for pathological fractures are 4: subtrochanteric femur  humeral head and metaphyseal junction vertebral body In addition, in adults patients, the avulsion of the femoral lesser trochanter should be considered a pathological fracture until proven otherwise 4.Treatment and prognosisPathological fractures are feared by oncologists because they may cause immobilization of their patients, especially when the spine or lower extremities are affected.Practical pointsA radiologist should mention the possibility of a pathological fracture if an osteolytic metastasis is seen. In principle, every osteolytic focus in the femoral neck or the spine is at risk of a pathological fracture.Scoring systems have been developed to assess the fracture risk of bone metastases, the Mirels classification is the one that has gained most traction, although its poor sensitivity (35%) means that it is not without its controversy 5.
__label__Musculoskeletal __label__Trauma Harrington criteria can be used to predict which long bone skeletal metastases are at high risk of pathological fracture and should undergo prophylactic internal fixation. It preceded the Mirels classification for impending pathological fracture but has not been validated and its use is debated.Classification >50% cortical bone destruction lesion >2.5 cm in size pathological avulsion fracture of the lesser trochanter functional pain after radiation therapy​  
__label__Musculoskeletal __label__Trauma Mirels classification is a system used to predict the highest risk of pathological fracture among long bones affected by metastases, and is based on site, location, matrix and/or presence of pain. Classification 1 point upper limb involving <1/3 of bone diameter blastic/sclerotic lesion mild pain   2 points lower limb involving 1/3-2/3 of bone diameter mixed sclerotic/lytic lesion moderate pain   3 points trochanteric region involves >2/3 of bone diameter lytic lesion functional pain   This will give a minimum score of four and a maximum score of 12. A score of ≥9 suggests that prophylactic fixation should be performed 1,2. For score 8 lesions, treatment is based on clinical judgment and for lower scores clinical management and radiotherapy is suggested. The overall sensitivity of the Mirel classification predicting fracture is ~90% but specificity is only 35% (meaning there will be unnecessary fixations) leading to debate about its usefulness 1,4.History and etymologyHilton Mirels (fl. 2019), a South African-born, American orthopedic surgeon, practising in New York State, described his proposed scoring system in an article published in 1989 6.

It represents the frontal lobes being pushed together forming a peak in the midline giving a heaped up appearance surrounded by air 1. Later, as the frontal lobes are separated they take on the so-called Mount Fuji sign.Although usually encountered in the setting of tension pneumocephalus it is not pathognomonic of increased pressure. 
__label__Vascular Peak systolic velocity (PSV) is an index measured in spectral Doppler ultrasound. On a Doppler waveform, the peak systolic velocity corresponds to each tall “peak” in the spectrum window 1. On this page:  Article: Explanation Factors that influence flow velocity indices See also Related articles References   Images:Cases and figures  ExplanationWhen traveling with their greatest velocity in a vessel (i.e. during systole), red blood cells exhibit their greatest magnitude of Doppler shift. The spectral Doppler system utilizes Fourier analysis and the Doppler equation to convert this shift into an equivalently large velocity, which appears in the velocity tracing as a “peak” 2.By the Doppler equation, it is noted that the magnitude of the Doppler shift is proportional to the cosine of the angle (of insonation) formed between the ultrasound beam and the axis of blood flow 2. Since the trigonometric ratio that relates these values is the cosine function, it follows that the angle of insonation should be maintained at ≤60o 1,2. At angles >60o, the cosine function curves much more steeply, leading to a significant reduction in the accuracy of angle correction, and thus the accuracy of blood velocity indices such as PSV and end-diastolic velocity (EDV) 1.Factors that influence flow velocity indicesFlow velocity may vary based on on vessel properties and pathological changes 3,4.Low resistance vessels (e.g. internal carotid artery, renal artery) supply end organs which require perfusion throughout the entire cardiac cycle. These vessels exhibit high diastolic flow and EDV 4. In contrast, high resistance vessels (e.g. external carotid artery, limb arteries) are characterized by early reversal of diastolic flow, and low or absent EDV 4.In stenosis, a localized reduction in vascular radius increases resistance, causing increased PSV and EDV distal to the stenosed site 3,4. High flow velocity causes Reynolds number to increase beyond a critical point, resulting in turbulent flow which manifests as spectral broadening on Doppler ultrasound 3. To an extent, an increased degree (%occlusion) of stenosis corresponds to increased PSV and EDV 4. In near occlusion (>99%), flow velocity indices become unreliable (may be high, low or absent) 4. In this setting, a significant reduction in post-stenotic flow velocity is termed “trickle flow” 5. In complete occlusion, PSV and EDV are absent 4.See also fetal middle cerebral arterial peak systolic velocity end-diastolic velocity (Doppler ultrasound)

Head CT involves radiation exposure and the risk of fatal radiation-related malignancy increases with younger age at CT 3. The PECARN flow diagram flags assessment features that increase the risk of ci-TBI and weighs them against the risk of radiation exposure. Therefore, it is useful in avoiding unnecessary radiation exposure in younger patients, where it is safe to do so, and identifying those at risk that requires further investigation.In PECARN, altered mental status was defined as GCS 14 or agitation, somnolence, repetitive questioning, or slow response to verbal communication.Severe mechanism of injuries included: motor vehicle crash with patient ejection death of another passenger, or rollover pedestrian or bicyclist without helmet struck by a motorised vehicle falls    more than 1.5 m (5 feet) for patients aged 2 years and older more than 0.9 m (3 feet) for those younger than 2 years   head struck by a high-impact object The algorithm was created from patients presenting to an emergency department within 24 hours of the trauma and with blunt trauma only.Excluded criteria included: penetrating trauma known brain tumors pre-existing neurological disorders complicating assessment neuroimaging at a hospital outside before transfer and therefore may not apply to patients with these features.TBI on CT was defined as any of:  intracranial hemorrhage or contusion  cerebral edema traumatic infarction diffuse axonal injury shearing injury sigmoid sinus thrombosis  midline shift of intracranial contents or signs of brain herniation  diastasis of the skull pneumocephalus  skull fracture depressed by at least the width of the table of the skull

__label__Musculoskeletal The pectineal ligament (somewhat confusingly also known as the inguinal ligament of Cooper) is an extension of the lacunar ligament that runs along the pectineal line of the pubis (also known as the pecten pubis).Gross anatomyThe pectineal ligament is a highly resistant structure that runs along the pecten pubis on the superior ramus of the pubic bone. It is formed from:fibers of the lacunar ligament periosteum along the superior pubic ramus aponeurotic fibers from the internal oblique muscle, transversus abdominis muscle and pectineus muscle 1 Some regard it as a thickening in the upper portion of the pectineal fascia.AttachmentsThe pectineal ligament attaches medially to the pubic tubercle, where it meets the inguinal ligament and the lacunar ligament.  It runs laterally along the pecten pubis, and slowly thins out along this course. It forms the posterior border of the femoral canal 2.History and etymology It was first described by Sir Astley Paston Cooper (1768-1841) an English surgeon and anatomist, in 1804 3.

It covers much of the front upper chest. It is composed of three parts named for their origins 8: clavicular head (pars clavicularis): originating from the anterior aspect of the medial half of the clavicle sternocostal head (pars sternocostalis): originating from the anterior part of the sternum and the costal cartilages of most of the true ribs (often excluding the first and/or seventh ribs) abdominal part (pars abdominalis): originating from the aponeurosis of the external oblique muscle  The heads of the pectoralis major converge on the humerus where it inserts into the lateral lip of the bicipital groove.Arterial supply the thoracoacromial artery provides its major blood supply the intercostal perforators arising from the internal thoracic artery provide a segmental blood supply.  the blood supply that provides circulation to this muscle perforates through to the breast, thus also providing its blood supply InnervationThe medial and lateral pectoral (or anterior thoracic) nerves provide innervation for the muscle, entering posteriorly and laterally.ActionThe function of this muscle is to bring the humerus across the chest, allowing to flex, adduct, and rotate the arm medially.Variant anatomy some authors consider sternalis muscle a variant of pectoralis major muscle rather than of the rectus abdominis muscle 7sternalis muscle may give some superior muscular slips which blend into pectoralis major  absenceseen in Poland syndrome   Radiographic featuresMammographyThe breast lies over the musculature that encases the chest wall. These muscles involved include pectoralis major, serratus anterior, external oblique, and rectus abdominis fascia. By maintaining continuity with the underlying musculature, the breast tissue remains richly perfused.Depending on a woman's habitus, pectoral muscles have variable angles of obliquity: short, stocky women have more horizontally oriented pectoral muscles tall, thin women have them more vertically oriented This element is very important for proper positioning in the efficacy of the medial lateral oblique (MLO) view in mammography: the compression of a pectoralis major differently oriented over a breast support inclined at 45° will produce a deformed geometric projection of the muscle and abnormal distribution of the quadrants, masking the "milky way" partially.On adequate mammogram it is recommended that pectoralis major is seen through to the level of the nipple.Related pathology  ginkgo leaf sign of subcutaneous emphysema  pectoralis major rupture

Most tears are thought to occur by indirect mechanism 3, during eccentric loading of the muscle during shoulder abduction and external rotation, such as occurs during lowering of weight during bench press.Injury may occur at several locations: sternal or clavicular muscle origin muscle belly myotendinous junction tendon intratendinous humeral insertion (with bone avulsion)   The location is important in consideration of treatment. Myotendinous and tendon/humeral insertion tears are the most common.Tears may be either an acute or chronic in nature.Radiographic featuresUltrasoundUltrasound features that may help diagnose a pectoralis major rupture include 2: disruption, dehiscence, or absence of tendon distally with retraction of tendon and muscle fibers associated hemorrhage (initially hypoechoic, becoming progressively heterogeneous with hematoma organization) abnormal echotexture of muscle belly if muscle belly injury MRIA dedicated study of pectoralis muscle may be required and a typical shoulder MRI usually does not allow optimal visualization of the pectoralis major muscle 2. In obtaining images, respiratory motion artefact may be minimized by abdominal breathing techniques.Features characteristic of injury include: tendon absence distally with retraction fluid gap in place of tendon Treatment and prognosisOptimal methods for treatment of pectoralis major tears remain under investigation and depends on location and extent of tear, chronicity, and patient factors. There is increasing evidence that surgical management may improve outcome in physically active patients 5.Complete tears, particularly of the tendon or myotendinous junction, are more commonly managed by surgical repair, consisting of either suturing or bone tunneling techniques.

__label__Chest __label__Musculoskeletal __label__Paediatrics Pectus excavatum, also known as funnel chest or trichterbrust 13, is a congenital chest wall deformity characterized by concave depression of the sternum, resulting in cosmetic and radiographic alterations. On this page:  Article: Epidemiology Clinical presentation Pathology Radiographic features Treatment and prognosis Differential diagnosis References   Images: Cases and figures Imaging differential diagnosis   EpidemiologyIt is the most common chest wall deformity, accounting for approximately 90% of cases, occurs in up to 1 in 300-1000 births and is more frequently seen in males (M:F = 3:1) 1,4. The opposite deformity is known as pectus carinatum (pigeon chest).Clinical presentationAlthough usually objectively asymptomatic, many patients report perceived inability to sustain physical activity. This is often associated with significant body-image issues which can have serious implications for affected children 4. Other than the obvious cosmetic and psychological issues, pectus excavatum is also occasionally associated with: mitral valve prolapse restrictive pulmonary function test abnormalities cardiac functional abnormalities PathologyAssociationsAlthough most are sporadic it can be seen in association with: Marfan syndrome Noonan syndrome Ehlers-Danlos syndrome neurofibromatosis type I myotonic dystrophy fetal alcohol syndrome homocystinuria osteogenesis imperfecta congenital scoliosis  Poland syndrome 6  Radiographic featuresPlain radiographCharacteristically demonstrates: blurring of right heart border (PA/AP film) increased density of the inferomedial lung zone 5  horizontal posterior ribs vertical anterior ribs (heart-shaped) displacement of heart towards the left obliteration of the descending aortic interface 5  widening of the cardiac silhouette due to compression of heart (PA/AP film) sharply defined and more vertically oriented medial breast borders in women, the medial breast margin sign 12  CTThe diagnosis is obvious on CT with the degree of deformity and mediastinal shift often dramatic.The Haller index (HI) (maximal transverse diameter/narrowest AP length of chest) is used to assess the severity of incursion of the sternum into the mediastinum. Normal Haller index is 2.5. Significant pectus excavatum has an index greater than 3.25, representing the standard for determining candidacy for repair.The depression index is computed by identifying the point of maximal depression of the sternum on the CT scan and then drawing a line across the most anterior ribs. This index uses the vertebral body diameter as a correlate to an individual’s size to help normalize for body size and the variable of the thickness of the soft tissue. A measurement is then taken from the mid-sternum perpendicular to this line. This skeletal sternal depression is then divided by the transverse diameter of the vertebral body at that level 9.The correction index (CI) requires drawing a horizontal line across the anterior spine. Then two distances are measured: the minimum distance between the posterior sternum and the anterior spine as is used for the HI and the maximum distance between the line placed on the anterior spine and the inner margin of the most anterior portion of the chest. The difference between the two lines is simply the amount of defect the patient has in their chest. If this difference between the measurements is then divided by the maximum prominence of the chest (the longer measurement) and multiplied by 100, it generates the percentage of chest depth the patient is missing centrally. Conversely, it represents the percentage of chest depth to be corrected by bar placement, or the correction index 10.The sternal torsion angle is an essential morphologic criterion to note for each patient with pectus excavatum. This is measured in the axial plane by taking the angle of the axis of the mediolateral length to the horizontal. Torsion measured at an angle more than 30° is considered severe, whereas mild torsion is applied to any angle less than 30° 11.Treatment and prognosisAlthough historically most cases were not treated, and early research suggested that even in extreme cases repair does not offer a significant improvement in respiratory function tests 2 more recently symptomatic improvement in ventilation and perfusion scans, as well as numerous other symptoms, have been described 3,7,8. Importantly, and contrary to earlier beliefs, pectus deformities often persist into adulthood and symptoms may become more pronounced 8. In addition to symptoms, the negative effects on body image and normal psychological development should also not be underestimated 4.Surgical options include metal bar insertion, rib osteotomies, disconnection of the sternum from costal cartilages and even reversal of the sternum 2. The Nuss procedure is a minimally invasive procedure where a concave bar is inserted substernally. It has largely replaced the Ravitch procedure which was significantly more invasive. Differential diagnosisFor the unwary, pectus excavatum can be troublesome on frontal chest radiographs. Differentials include:  right middle lobe consolidation/atelectasis  left para-aortic soft tissue density lung or paravertebral mass  atelectasis/consolidation of the medial segment of the left lower lobe    mediastinal mass due to deformation of the cardiomediastinal contour  The diagnosis is obvious on lateral projection, and of course cross-sectional imaging.
__label__Paediatrics The posteroanterior erect chest view is often performed in older pediatric patients; when the patient is able to cooperate with sitting or standing erect. This chest view examines the lungs, bony thoracic cavity, mediastinum and great vessels.The PA erect view is often chosen over the AP erect view in pediatric imaging due to the decreased radiation dose to radiosensitive organs: developing breast, sternum and thyroid 1. The choice to perform a PA erect or AP erect chest view will depend on the radiographer’s judgment of the patient’s cooperative and understanding ability.

Therefore, radiographers must ensure that the child understands that no motion is required. This may be done in the form of a game or through explanations if they are old enough to understand. Some examples of specialized communication techniques to gain cooperation from the child include: “lets play dead fish!” “freeze!” “you have to breathe in like you are about to blow out a birthday candle!” “take a big sniff now” It may also be difficult to observe the patient breathing in when they are in a PA position; therefore practising with the child before exposing and observing the child's shoulders carefully can give an indication of inspiration. 
__label__Oncology __label__Paediatrics Pediatric cystic nephromas, previously known as multilocular cystic nephromas, are rare benign renal neoplasms occurring in children. As of the 2016 WHO classification, they are considered distinct from adult cystic nephromas 1,2. On this page:  Article: Terminology Epidemiology Clinical presentation Pathology Radiographic features Treatment and prognosis Differential diagnosis Related articles References   Images:Cases and figures  TerminologyEvolving terminology regarding cystic nephromas and other cystic renal tumors reflects ongoing changes in classification, in step with shifting understanding of the disease processes and genetic aberrations.Classically, cystic nephromas were thought to occur in a bimodal age distribution, affecting young children and adults in middle age and the generic term "multilocular cystic renal tumor" was sometimes used.Lesions arising in children are distinct from adult cystic nephromas on both immunohistochemical and genetic bases, and are separately categorized by WHO pediatric cystic nephroma (pediatric)  cystic nephroma (adult)  cystic partially differentiated nephroblastoma (pediatric) The remainder of this article will discuss pediatric cystic nephroma.Epidemiology overall rare young children (3 months to 5 years of age) - 75% male predilection Clinical presentationPediatric cystic nephroma usually present as an asymptomatic palpable abdominal mass felt by parents, with increasing abdominal girth. It may also present with hematuria or possibly urinary tract infection.PathologyGrossly, cystic nephroma are typically unifocal multiloculated cystic masses surrounded by a thick fibrous capsule and compressed parenchyma 3,4. Calcification, hemorrhage, and necrosis are unusual. Microscopically, these tumors are lined by flat, cuboid, or hobnail cells 4, while the fibrous septa may contain mature tubules 5. As opposed to cystic partially differentiated nephroblastoma, the tumor septa contain no blastema cells. Genetic analysis show a high prevalence (86%) of DICER1 gene mutations in pediatric cases, as compared to ~10% of adult cystic nephroma 2.AssociationsA familial association of cystic nephroma with the cystic type of pleuropulmonary blastoma related to DICER1 mutation has been described.Radiographic featuresPediatric cystic nephromas generally have the appearance of a multilocular cystic encapsulated mass on most modalities.Plain radiographMay present as a large abdominal mass displacing and effacing adjacent bowel loops.Ultrasound multilocular cystic mass originating from kidney 6 claw or beak-shape of adjacent renal parenchyma (claw sign) may help confirm a renal origin  cyst contents usually anechoic, but low-level echoes may be seen septal vascularity can also be seen 4  CT multilocular cystic mass often herniates into the renal pelvis variable septal enhancement no nodular or solid enhancement 4  +/- associated streakiness in perirenal fat 6  MRISignal characteristics include 4,6:  T1: variable signal, depending on the protein or blood products of the cysts  T2: hyperintense (cysts)  T1 C+ (Gd): septal enhancement may be seen Treatment and prognosisRadical or partial nephrectomy is usually done, with lymph node excision.Differential diagnosis  cystic partially differentiated nephroblastoma impossible to differentiate by imaging alone similar age-group no DICER 1 mutation    cystic Wilms tumor from pediatric cystic nephromas solid nodular components in a tumor should arouse suspicion of Wilms tumor 8  pediatric cystic nephroma tends to occur in younger children than Wilms tumors    multicystic dysplastic kidney (MCDK) entire kidney is replaced by noncommunicating cysts usually diagnosed prenatally or at birth, while multiloculated cystic renal tumors do not occur in the perinatal period 4  enhanced compressed renal parenchyma is seen to surround cystic nephroma on contrast-enhanced cross-sectional studies, while this tissue is absent in MCDK   
__label__Central __label__Nervous __label__System Peduncular hallucinosis is an uncommon neurological symptom characterized by vivid, well formed visual hallucinations. Clinical presentationThe visual hallucinations are sterotyped, vivid and tend to not cause the patient significant distress. Additional symptoms include difficulty sleep at night with resultant hypersomnia during the day. Oculomotor abnormalities are also encountered 1. Radiographic featuresCausative lesions are typically in the rostral brainstem (especially cerebral peduncle as the name suggests) but may also be seen in the thalamus, pons and basal diencephalon 1. Essentially any lesion in this area can be causative, including ischemic (most common), hemorrhagic lesions, vascular malformations and tumors 1,2. Although CT may give a clue as to the presence of an abnormality in the region, MRI is the modality of choice of assessing patients with suspected peduncular hallucinosis.

__label__Gynaecology Pelvic actinomycosis infection is rare but serious infection caused by Actinomyces sp., an opportunistic gram-positive bacteria usually introduced by foreign bodies specially IUCDs, surgery, or trauma. It generally falls under the broader spectrum of pelvic inflammatory disease. On this page:  Article: Pathology Radiographic features Complications Treatment and prognosis Differential diagnosis References   Images:Cases and figures  PathologyPelvic infection from several Actinomyces sp. can occur, which include:  Actinomyces israelii: by far the most common causative organism 3  Actinomyces naeslundii Actinomyces viscosus Actinomyces eriksonii  The organisms are indigenous in the oral cavity, gastrointestinal tract, and genital tract, with opportunistic infection occurring when the mucosal barrier is broken.Associationsplacement of intra-uterine contraceptive devices: usually when it has been present for a prolonged period ~25% of IUCDs eventually get colonized by Actinomycosis sp.  2-4% of IUCDs that are colonized ultimately develop a serious actinomycotic infection  Radiographic featuresActinomycosis infection can mimic many other pelvic pathologies on imaging. The spread of infective/inflammatory change across tissue planes, and in particular retroperitoneal extension into the psoas muscle may suggest the diagnosis. The most common site of involvement of the GI system is the ileocecal junction.Other findings: indurated pelvic fat pelvic free fluid  pelvic abscess  hydronephrosis Complications wider intra-abdominal extension: mainly through contiguous spread formation of tubo-ovarian abscess 2  subsequent infertility  Treatment and prognosisTreatment is usually with IV penicillin in uncomplicated cases. The presence of an associated complication such as a tubo-ovarian abscess would warrant surgical intervention.Differential diagnosisDue to its non-specific imaging appearances, pelvic actinomycosis can mimic several pathology such as: other forms of pelvic inflammatory diseasetuberculous pelvic inflammatory disease  pelvic malignancy ovarian cancers: as a general rule, may incite more ascites and lymphadenopathy  
__label__Musculoskeletal The pelvic brim sign is seen in the AP view of the pelvis and refers to a thickening of the pelvic brim outlined by the iliopectineal line. It is due to an osteoblastic reaction seen and first described in Paget disease, which leads to cortical thickening and sclerosis 1.

__label__Urogenital __label__Gynaecology Pelvic congestion syndrome (some prefer pelvic venous insufficiency 9) is a condition that results from retrograde flow through incompetent valves in ovarian veins. It is a commonly missed and potentially-treatable cause of chronic abdominopelvic pain.  On this page:  Article: Epidemiology Clinical presentation Pathology Radiographic features Treatment and prognosis History and etymology See also Related articles References   Images:Cases and figures  EpidemiologyIt tends to be more common in multiparous, premenopausal women who typically present with chronic pelvic pain for more than 6 months 1. The overall population prevalence may approach ~10%.Clinical presentationPatients often have non-cyclical chronic (typically dull and aching) pelvic pain. In certain cases there may be thigh or vulvar varices. It is often considered a diagnosis of exclusion.PathologyPelvic congestion syndrome is considered the female equivalent to a testicular varicocele. It is caused by: venous obstruction: such as retroaortic left renal vein  compression of left renal vein by SMA also known as nutcracker phenomenon  incompetent valves in ovarian vein Radiographic featuresThe diagnosis of pelvic congestion syndrome is established by the demonstration of multiple dilated, tortuous parauterine veins with a width >4 mm or an ovarian vein diameter greater than 5-6 mm 4.Ultrasound ovarian vein >5-6 mm (positive predictive value of 71-83%)  may show multiple dilated veins in the adnexa with reversed venous flow on color Doppler, especially after Valsalva maneuver  the venous calibers may increase on real time during Valsalva prominent myometrial veins may also be present 1-8  CT Contrast enhanced CT typically shows dilated pelvic and ovarian veins. The supine position during scanning may underestimate the size of venous dilatation.MRIMR venographyMay show dilated veins. Time of flight (TOF) imaging can be performed where contrast is not required.Signal characteristics  T1: seen as flow voids which represent engorged arcuate vessels  T2: mostly high signal but can vary dependent on velocities from low signal to iso signal  GE: high signal   Treatment and prognosisTreatment options include coil embolization of the gonadal vein: ovarian vein embolization. Surgical (e.g. laparoscopic) ligation of the ovarian vein may also be an option in selected cases. The presence of multiple collaterals between iliac and ovarian venous plexuses may cause recurrence of symptoms.History and etymologyPelvic congestion syndrome was first described in 1857 by Louis Alfred Richet (1816-1891), a French anatomist and surgeon 10.See alsoovarian vein syndrome
__label__Musculoskeletal Pelvic digit, also known as a pelvic rib, pelvic finger or 11th finger, is a rare congenital abnormality where there is development of bony tissue in the soft tissue pelvis and less commonly in the abdomen. They can be associated with one or more pseudoarticulations. They are usually unilateral, though one case of bilateral pelvic digits has been reported 5.The condition was first described by Sullivan and Cornwell in 1974, where a rib was noted radiologically in a girl 6. Most cases of pelvic digit variations occur to the ilium.

__label__Musculoskeletal __label__Trauma Pelvic fractures can be simple or complex and can involve any part of the bony pelvis. Pelvic fractures can be fatal, and an unstable pelvis requires immediate management. On this page:  Article: Epidemiology Clinical presentation Pathology Radiographic features Treatment and prognosis Related articles References   Images:Cases and figures  EpidemiologyPelvic fractures can be seen in any group of patients. Like much trauma, there is a bimodal distribution with younger male patients involved in high-energy trauma and older female patients presenting after minor trauma.Clinical presentationPatients tend to present following trauma with pelvic/hip pain. They will often be immobilized by ambulance crews on arrival and potentially have other life-threatening conditions associated with high-energy trauma.PathologyMost pelvic fractures result from trauma 3: motor vehicle collision (~50%) pedestrian vs motor vehicle (~30%) fall from height (~10%) motorbike collisions (~4%) other e.g. sports injury, low-energy fall Pelvic insufficiency fractures are common in the elderly.The type of fracture that occurs is a result of the type of injury (impact or compression), the energy involved and the strength of the bones.The potential morbidity associated with these fractures is related to the involvement of the pelvic ring. Injuries that result in disruption of the pelvic rings result in a significantly worse prognosis.Direct impact low-to-moderate energy injuries usually result in a solitary and localized fracture. Compression injuries tend to cause fractures that involve the pelvic ring and are unstable.ClassificationFour main forces have been described in high-energy blunt force trauma that results in unstable pelvic fractures 1,3,5:  anteroposterior compression: result in an open book or sprung pelvis fractures  lateral compression: result in a windswept pelvis   vertical shear: results in Malgaigne fracture or bucket handle fracture   combined mechanical: occur when two different force vectors are involved and results in a complex fracture pattern The Young and Burgess classification grades injuries using this method.Isolated stable pelvic fractures can also occur in the context of lower energy mechanisms or sporting injuries: acetabular fracture pubic ramus fracture iliac wing fracture (Duverney fracture) avulsion fractures (e.g. ASIS, iliac crest, ischial tuberosity) Associated injuriesPelvic fractures carry a significant risk of uncontrolled pelvic bleeding and exsanguination from pelvic fractures is a real possibility. This may result in pelvic, thigh and/or retroperitoneal hemorrhage. Pelvic angio-embolization should be considered in patients with evidence of persistent blood loss with no evidence of intra-abdominal bleeding prior to surgical fixation 3, 4.Other complications include 4: bladder rupture urethral rupture Radiographic featuresThe radiographic features are varied and even for serious and severe injuries can be subtle on plain radiographs.Plain radiographX-ray is a quick and simple test that will detect the majority of pelvic fractures. They can be difficult to assess because of the complexity of the shape of the sacrum, pelvis and proximal femora.CTCT is the modality of choice for accurately depicting complex acetabular or pelvic ring fractures. After an initial plain radiograph, a CT is often required to make an accurate assessment of the fracture.Treatment and prognosisTreatment and prognosis depend on the type of injury. Simple ramal fractures are treated by immobilization. Multi-part acetabular fractures require reconstruction by an experienced operator. Complex pelvic ring fractures may require external fixation. In these patients, their prognosis is partly dependent on their comorbidities and other related injuries.Pelvic fractures carry a significant mortality and morbidity. It has been reported that ~75% of pre-hospital deaths from motor vehicle collisions are secondary to pelvic fractures 3.

__label__Gynaecology Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) is a broad term that encompasses a spectrum of infection and inflammation of the upper female genital tract, resulting in a range of abnormalities.  On this page:  Article: Epidemiology Clinical presentation Pathology Radiographic features Treatment and prognosis Differential diagnosis Related articles References   Images:Cases and figures  EpidemiologyThe highest incidence is seen among sexually-active women in their teens, with 75% cases being under 25 years of age.  In the United States, approximately 1 million females are thought to be afflicted with pelvic inflammatory disease per year, and nearly 275,000 of them are believed to be hospitalized 7.Clinical presentationMore common presentations include acute pelvic pain (of variable intensity), cervical motion tenderness, vaginal discharge, fever, dyspareunia, and leukocytosis. Right upper quadrant pain from perihepatitis in Fitz-Hugh-Curtis syndrome is possible.PathologyPID is defined as an acute clinical syndrome associated with ascending spread of micro-organisms, unrelated to pregnancy or surgery. The infection generally ascends from the vagina or cervix to the endometrium (endometritis), then to the fallopian tubes (salpingitis), and then to and/or contiguous structures (tubo-ovarian abscess). It can result from a number of causative organisms:  common  Chlamydia trachomatis: pelvic chlamydial infection   Neisseria gonorrhoeae: pelvic gonococcal infection  polymicrobial infection: can account for ~35% of cases 3     less common  Mycobacterium tuberculosis: pelvic tuberculous infection   Actinomyces spp.: pelvic actinomyces infection    PID is usually bilateral, except when it is caused by the direct extension of an adjacent inflammatory process such as appendiceal, diverticular, or post-surgical abscesses.Radiographic featuresImaging features are often non-specific but are disproportionate to what may be apparent from symptoms. If imaged early (e.g. during the cervicitis stage), there may be no finding. If imaged very late, there may be an adnexal mass-like region with surrounding inflammatory change, and the fallopian tube and ovary may not be able to be distinguished.Other associated findings include 7: soft-tissue stranding and infiltration of pelvic floor fascial planes thickening of uterosacral ligaments UltrasoundUltrasound often only demonstrates ascitic fluid in the peritoneal cavity or non-specific thickening and increased vascularity of the endometrium 8.In the most severe cases, ultrasound may show adnexal masses with a heterogeneous echo-pattern.Some sonographic signs associated with tubal inflammation include:thickened/dilated fallopian tubes incomplete septa in the tube increased vascularity around the tube echogenic fluid in the tube (pyosalpinx)   cogwheel sign beads on a string sign CT thickening of the uterosacral ligaments complex free fluid in the pouch of Douglas (cul-de-sac) pelvic fat stranding or haziness indistinct uterine border fallopian tube thickening of >5 mm with enhancing wall reactive lymphadenopathylymph nodes in the para-aortic and paracaval regions often become prominent due to infection draining in to lymphatics along the course of the gonadal veins  MRIMay show an ill-defined adnexal mass containing fluid with various signal intensities: T1+C (Gd): wall and surrounding tissues may enhanceTreatment and prognosisIn the absence of complications, pelvic inflammatory disease is often treated conservatively with education, antibiotics, and partner tracing.Complications tubo-ovarian abscess pyosalpinx  infertility due to tubal adhesions peritonitis ovarian vein thrombosis peritoneal adhesion formation causing bowel obstruction Fitz-Hugh-Curtis syndrome Differential diagnosis fallopian tube carcinoma rare consider in a patient without risk factors for PID and/or a patient in whom a course of antibiotics did not resolve the PID

They often occur in characteristic locations and patterns within the pelvis, and are best detected and evaluated using bone scintigraphy and/or MRI. CT is a relatively insensitive method of detection. Pelvic insufficiency fractures are typically occult on plain film unless secondary remodelling has begun.Common locations include the following:  sacrum: (sacral insufficiency fracture) usually vertically through the sacral ala, paralleling the sacroiliac joint, often with a transverse component - this pattern resembles the capital letter H, leading to the designation H sign (or Honda sign)  medial iliac: vertical fracture paralleling the sacroiliac joint  supra-acetabular region: about 1/3 are associated with sacral insufficiency fractures  iliac wing: oblique fracture through the iliac wing, oriented somewhat parallel to the iliac crest  pubic rami: nearly 90% of fractures at this site occur in conjunction with insufficiency fractures elsewhere within the pelvis  parasymphyseal: (parasymphyseal insufficiency fracture 4,5) also frequently associated with other pelvic insufficiency fractures

__label__Musculoskeletal __label__Paediatrics Pelvic osteotomy relates to an orthopedic treatment for developmental acetabular dysplasia of the hip.The main purpose of pelvic osteotomy is the prevention of early degenerative changes by stabilization of the hip and redistribution of joint loading. It is obtained by surgical reshaping/remodelling or redirection of an abnormal acetabulum. TypesReshaping osteotomy (performed when the triradiate cartilage is open): Dega Pemberton Redirectional osteotomy (orientation of the acetabulum is changed by transection of the innominate bone) Salter (single innominate osteotomy) Sutherland (double innominate osteotomy)  Steel, Tonnis or Carlios (triple innominate osteotomy)  Ganz (periacetabular)  
__label__Gynaecology It is important to have a systematic way of approaching a case with pelvic pain in the exam. Most examinations are performed using ultrasound. Always say that you would further assess the uterus with 3D ultrasound. You may also say that in my department we would perform a sonohysterogram. Only suggest further imaging with HSG or MRI if prompted. Common causes include: hematometrocolpos ovarian torsion ovarian carcinoma hemorrhagic ovarian cyst pregnancy with an ovarian tumor ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome dermoid cyst post menopausal ovarian cyst endometritis  pyometrium  hydrosalpinx pelvic inflammatory disease exophytic fibroid vs ovarian fibroma  myometrial tumors sex cord stromal tumor adenomyosis Uncommon causes include: Gartner cysts periurethral cysts urethral diverticula nabothian cysts See alsoviva examination viva technique viva preparation exam set-pieces gynecological ultrasound set-pieces  
__label__Urogenital The pelvic peritoneal space is the inferior reflection of the peritoneum over the fundus of the urinary bladder and the front of the rectum at the junction of its middle and lower thirds. In females, the reflection is also over the anterior and posterior surface of the uterus and the upper posterior vagina.The urinary bladder subdivides the pelvis into right and left paravesical spaces.In males there is only one potential space for fluid collection posterior to the bladder, the rectovesical pouch.In females there are two potential spaces posterior to the bladder, the uterovesical pouch, and posterior to the uterus the deeper rectouterine pouch (pouch of Douglas).The layers of peritoneum on the anterior and posterior surfaces of the uterus are reflected laterally to the pelvic side walls as the broad ligaments, containing the fallopian tubes.The pelvic peritoneal spaces are continues with the right and left inframesocolic spaces via the right and left paracolic gutters, respectively.
__label__Gynaecology Evaluation of known endometriosis with MRI requires a slightly different protocol to a routine pelvic MRI (see Pelvic MRI protocol: routine), and should probably be reserved for known cases of endometriosis rather than for the assessment of pelvic pain.IV (or IM) Buscopan® is administered to reduce bowel peristalsis and hence improve image quality.A good protocol involves: body coil T1W and T2W axial T1W fat-suppressed sequences 1: axial, sagittal and coronal Gadolinium is not particularly useful in the evaluation of endometriomas 2 and does not improve detection of very small implants as small vessels enhance and may be misinterpreted as a small endometriotic deposit 1. Additionally, enhancement of endometrial deposits is variable post contrast and does not differentiate from other benign or malignant processes.See alsoMRI protocols

__label__Musculoskeletal The pelvic radiograph checklist is just one of the many pathology checklists that can be used when reporting to ensure that you always actively exclude pathology that is commonly missed; this is particularly helpful in the examination setting, e.g. the FRCR 2B rapid-reporting.Plain radiographPelvis and hip radiographs in an exam setting will have been primarily performed because of a history of pain or trauma.Hip joints/ capsule  avascular necrosis tumoral calcinosis pseudogout inflammatory arthritis i.e. rheumatoid arthritis  osteoarthritis aseptic arthroplasty loosening primary synovial chondromatosis secondary synovial chondromatosis septic arthritis dislocation Proximal femur neck of femur fracture proximal femoral fracture isolated greater trochanter fracture enchondroma chondrosarcoma fibrous dysplasia  femoral acetabular impingement (FAI) Sacrum insufficiency fracture complex pelvic fracture Sacroiliac joints inflammatory spondyloarthropathy i.e ankylosing spondylitis  septic arthritis osteitis condensans ilii Lower lumbar spine Bertolotti syndrome spondyloptosis interspinous calcification Ilium tendinous avulsion injuries  Paget disease - sarcomatous transformation   metastasis  lucent sclerotic   Soft tissues Morel-Lavallée lesion hydroxyapatite disease inguinal hernia prostate brachytherapy clips renal transplant calcified atherosclerotic disease See alsopelvic radiograph (an approach)
__label__Musculoskeletal Pelvic resections are complex surgeries in a which a part of the pelvic ring is surgically removed, usually to treat a malignant tumor (such as a chondrosarcoma).Originally, these resections removed half of the pelvis and the ipsilateral limb hemipelvectomy classic hemipelvectomy / hindquarter amputation modified hemipelvectomy: some iliac bone adjacent to the sacroiliac joint is spared extended hemipelvectomy: part of the ipsilateral sacrum is resected as well, trangressing the sacral foramina  Because of the extreme disfigurement of these surgeries, their poor recovery, and their high morbidity, modifications to preserve the ipsilateral limb were developed. Each pelvic resection is customized to the patient and the tumor, but several types were defined 1:  type 1: ilium resection partial complete   type 2: periacetabular resection type 3: pubic resection Some define a type 4 as an ilium resection that extends into the ipsilateral sacrum (essentially an "extended" type 1).
__label__Musculoskeletal The pelvic teardrop, also known as U-figure or Köhler's​ teardrop, is a radiographic feature seen on pelvic x-rays and results from the end-on projection of a bony ridge running along the floor of the acetabular fossa.This was shown to be the case by demonstrating that sawing away this bony plate made the feature disappear. It has also been confirmed by Vare in 1952 by applying a thin "strip of lead foil applied to the acetabular fossa and curving round the inferior margin of this, up over the inner wall of the lesser pelvis as far as the ilio-pectineal eminence."In adults, it may be used as a marker for measurement of the acetabular angle and Köhler teardrop distance (see Waldenström sign).See alsoteardrop (disambiguation)
__label__Musculoskeletal Pelvic tilt is one of the parameters contributing to the individual pelvic orientation. It is measured on an AP pelvic radiograph as the distance between the midportion of the sacrococcygeal joint and the upper border of the symphysis pubis.As a rule of thumb, this distance should amount to (on average) 1: 32 mm in men 47 mm in women Practical pointsIt is important to always assess the pelvic tilt on a pelvic radiograph, as variations in it can alter the measures of acetabular anatomy, like lateral center-edge angle or crossover sign 2.
__label__Gynaecology Pelvic ultrasound is usually the initial modality for imaging gynecologic pathology, including acute pelvic pain and chronic pelvic pain. The exam normally involves two components: a transabdominal (TA) evaluation and a transvaginal (TV) / endovaginal (EV) evaluation. On this page:  Article: Normal ultrasound anatomy Technique Practical points See also Related articles References   Images:Cases and figures  Normal ultrasound anatomyUterus(see: uterus) consists of endometrium, junctional zone, and myometrium the appearance of the endometrium depends on which part of a woman's menstrual cycle she is in, and can vary from 2-15 mm the endometrium normally has a three-layer appearance at midcycle, but is usually more homogeneous later the junctional zone may be difficult to detect on ultrasound the uterus is normally tilted toward the anterior abdominal wall (anteverted) if the uterus is enlarged, the transabdominal exam may be needed to evaluate the full size Adnexa the ovaries also vary in size with the menstrual cycle due to varying sizes of follicles nulliparous: 9 mL maximum volume parous: 15 mL maximum volume   a dominant follicle in the ovaries reaches 20-25 mm diameter at maturity do not call an anechoic ovarian structure a "cyst" in a premenopausal woman unless it is >30 mm the dominant follicle becomes the corpus luteum    fallopian tubes are not normally seen on ultrasound, unless dilated or surrounded by free pelvic fluid TechniquePelvic ultrasound usually includes two components: transabdominal (TA) evaluation transvaginal (TV) evaluationsome prefer the term "endovaginal" (EV)  The transabdominal component is always performed first. The transvaginal component is performed second and, because of the higher resolution of the transvaginal probe, is usually very helpful for an evaluation of the pelvic structures.Despite the usefulness of the transvaginal exam, it may not be performed if: the patient does not want it the patient has never had sexual intercourse (virgo intacta)  pediatric patient Transabdominal examA mid-low frequency transducer (e.g. up to 5 MHz) is usually used. A full bladder is used as an acoustic window to achieve better imaging of the uterus and adnexa.The transabdominal exam is used for a general overview of the pelvis, and may be necessary in some situations in order to image the entirety of some pelvic pathologies.Transvaginal/endovaginal examA mid-high frequency probe (e.g. >7 MHz) is usually used. The bladder is emptied before the exam. The higher frequency allows a better spatial resolution and Doppler evaluation of the pelvis.Practical points mural nodularity can be missed in large cystic lesions, make sure to carefully evaluate the entire wall if there is trouble determining which organ a mass is arising from, a bimanual technique can be used in which the mass is imaged while the two organs are manually pushed in different directions if the mass moves with an organ, it arises from the organ if the mass slides past an organ, it arises from the adjacent organ   if the uterus is retroverted, consider endometriosis  See also uterus differential for endometrial thickening ovaries cervix 
__label__Musculoskeletal __label__Gynaecology The term pelvis (plural: pelvises or pelves) can refer to either the bony pelvis or the pelvic cavity. On this page:  Article: Bony pelvis Pelvic cavity Radiographic features Related articles References   Images:Cases and figures  Bony pelvisThe bony pelvis is formed by the sacrum and coccyx and a pair of hip bones ("ossa coxae"), which are part of the appendicular skeleton. Its primary function is the transmission of forces from the axial skeleton to the lower limbs as well as supporting the pelvic viscera. Until puberty, each hip bone consists of three separate bones yet to be fused: ilium, ischium and pubis connected by the triradiate cartilage. The two hip bones are joined anteriorly at the pubic symphysis and posteriorly to the sacrum at the sacroiliac joint. The hip bones incorporate the acetabulum, which articulates with the proximal femur at the hip joint. Sex differencesDifferences between the males and female bony pelvis arise as an adaptation of the female pelvis to childbearing 3: infrapubic angle is greater than 90° in females pelvic inlet shape males: heart-shaped females: round or oval   wider greater sciatic notch in females acetabulum faces more anteriorly in females sacrum more triangular and shorter in females oval or triangular obturator foramen in females The shape of the female bony pelvis can be described using the following terms 3: gynaecoid pelvis (50%): normal female type anthropoid pelvis (25%): long AP diameters, short transverse diameters and narrow infrapubic angle android pelvis (20%): male type with conical shaped pelvic cavity and heart-shaped pelvic inlet platypelloid ("flat female") pelvis (5%): short AP diameters, long transverse diameters and wide infrapubic angle Pelvic aperturesThe pelvic brim defines the pelvic inlet and the following structures contribute to it 2: anteriorly: pubic crest, pecten pubis laterally: arcuate line (of the ilium) posteriorly: sacral ala The pelvic outlet is formed by the following structures 2: anteriorly: pubic arch, inferior margin of the pubic symphysis, pubic rami, ischial rami laterally: ischial tuberosities posterolaterally: sacrotuberous ligaments posteriorly: sacrum and coccyx Pelvic cavityThe pelvic cavity is inferior part of the abdominopelvic cavity and is in direct connection with the abdominal cavity. The pelvic cavity is bounded by the bony pelvis and the pelvic musculature and primarily contains reproductive organs and the rectum. It is divided into:   lesser pelvis (or true or minor pelvis) is inferior to the pelvic brim and lies between the pelvic inlet and the pelvic outlet  greater pelvis (or false or major pelvis) is the expanded portion of the cavity situated superior and anterior to the pelvic brim Pelvic visceraThe visceral contents of the pelvis is different between the sexes due to the difference in gonadal descent and gonadal tube formation 2. common: rectum, urinary bladder, ureters  male: prostate, male urethra, seminal vesicles, ejaculatory ducts, ductus deferens  female: ovaries, uterine tubes, uterus, vagina, female urethra  Radiographic featuresPlain radiographUseful for imaging the bony pelvis and can be used in contrast studies, for example, urethrograms or intravenous pyelograms (IVP).UltrasoundFirst-line imaging modality for assessing both the male and female pelvic viscera. Doppler ultrasound can also be used to assess the pelvic vasculature 3.CTDue to radiation exposure to the gonads, CT is not the first line imaging test for evaluating the pelvic viscera except in the setting of trauma 3.MRIMRI provides superior soft tissue contrast resolution for imaging the anatomy (best seen in T1-weighted) and pathology (best seen on T2-weighted) of the pelvis 3.AngiographyInvasive angiography is the gold standard modality for assessing pelvic vasculature 3.

One must take into account patient mobility, and if possible, not perform the projection alone. Patients who are only able to stand for short periods of time need clear demonstration of how the radiographic examination is to take place, to avoid additional time out of the bed.Although routinely performed AP, performing the projection PA has the benefit in giving the patient an upright detector to use for stabilization if balance is lost.
__label__Paediatrics __label__Musculoskeletal Hip surveillance radiographs are part of a concerted effort to monitor and enable early detection of hip displacement in patients with cerebral palsy or neuromuscular disorders. The radiographs consist of a modified AP pelvis in which the patient's legs are in a neutral position, with the patellae facing anteriorly.

__label__Musculoskeletal The AP inlet view is part of a pelvic series examining the iliac crest, sacrum, proximal femur, pubis, ischium and the great pelvic ring. It is of considerable importance in the management of severely injured patients presenting to emergency departments 1. This particular view is perpendicular to the pelvic rim, allowing for assessment of any suspected narrowing or widening of that rim. Additionally it is used to assess anterior-posterior displacement of pubic rami fractures.

The use of AEC in this projection is debatable; it is best to adjust your exposure based on the AEC read out of the AP pelvis.
__label__Musculoskeletal The oblique pelvis otherwise known as the Judet view is an additional projection to the pelvic series when there is suspicion of an acetabular fracture.The Judet view is comprised of two projections, first the iliac oblique for assessment of the posterior column and anterior wall of the acetabulum; secondly, the obturator oblique view demonstrating the anterior column of the pelvis along with the posterior wall of the acetabulum.

The iliac wing, as it is 'flatten' out on the image, should be well demonstrated.The obturator oblique projection should distinctly show the posterior rim as well as the anterior ilioischial line. As per the name, the obturator foramen is well demonstrated.Practical pointsThe 'Judet view' is a two-part view of the acetabulum, the collimation of the Judet views is departmentally dependent.Some institutions will advise the Judet views are done as a full two view oblique pelvis (see figure 1 and 2). In this case, it would be a landscape projection with a full-sized detector, with the same centering parameters as the AP pelvis.
__label__Musculoskeletal The AP outlet view is part of a pelvic series examining the iliac crest, sacrum, proximal femur, pubis, ischium and the great pelvic ring.

__label__Paediatrics The radiography of the pelvis in the pediatric patient varies greatly from the adult examination; particularly as specialized techniques are often required to immobilize the patient. To avoid future mobility and pain complications, it is essential to treat fractures and correct developmental pathologies whilst the child is still developing. Therefore, the diagnostic pelvic radiograph is an essential part of this process. On this page:  Article: Indications Projections Patient preparation Tips for pediatric pelvis radiography Pelvic radiograph lines Related articles References   Images:Cases and figures  IndicationsPerforming pelvis radiography on pediatric patients can be for a number of indications 1: trauma fall developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH) transient synovitis perthes disease slipped upper femoral epiphysis (SUFE) ProjectionsStandard projections AP pelvis frog leg lateral Additional projections hip surveillance in cerebral palsy patients abduction-internal rotation (AIR) view Patient preparationPatients should remove any clothing from the waist down; especially baby rompers as these often have metal buttons. Wet diapers are also known to create artifact on the radiograph, therefore should be removed 2.Gonadal shieldingThe use of gonadal shielding will vary from department to department. However, recent studies no longer recommend the use of gonadal shielding for pediatric pelvis examinations 3,4. When placed incorrectly, additional repeats will be required, thereby increasing the radiation dose to the patient.Tips for pediatric pelvis radiographyThe major difficulty in pediatric pelvis radiography relates to: motion artifact rotation of the pelvis due to patient motion To overcome this, a variety of techniques can be used: distract the patient with toys, games and/or conversation using the swaddling technique; wrap the child in a blanket to promote comfort and sleep ensure the child’s distraction lies directly above or in front of them so they are not rotating their body to look at it (e.g. turning around to look at their parent) Immobilization techniquesAs children are lying supine for the examination, distraction techniques may prove difficult. Therefore, immobilization techniques will vary from department to department. A radiographer or parent being in the room with the patient holding them still has been cited as a commonly used technique 5 in the Australian context. Other departments will make use of restraint devices, there is debate around the use of 'restraint' and if it fits the category of 'immobilization' 6.Pelvic radiograph linesWhen interpreting a pediatric pelvis x-ray, a number of lines will be inspected; where interruption of these lines will indicate pathology: shenton's line perkin's line hilgenreiner's line

__label__Urogenital __label__Paediatrics Pelviureteric junction (PUJ) obstruction/stenosis, also known as ureteropelvic junction (UPJ) obstruction/stenosis, can be one of the causes of obstructive uropathy. It can be congenital or acquired with a congenital PUJ obstruction being one of the commonest causes of antenatal hydronephrosis. On this page:  Article: Epidemiology Clinical presentation Pathology Radiographic features Treatment and prognosis Differential diagnosis References   Images: Cases and figures Imaging differential diagnosis   EpidemiologyIt may present in both pediatric and adult populations although they tend to have differing etiology. The estimated incidence in pediatric populations is ~1 per 1000-2000 newborns, and there is a male predominance (M:F = 2:1).Clinical presentationMany cases are asymptomatic and identified incidentally when the renal tract is imaged for other reasons. When symptomatic, symptoms include recurrent urinary tract infections, stone formation and even a palpable flank mass. They are also at high risk of renal injury even by minor trauma.Classically intermittent pain after drinking large volumes of fluid or fluids with a diuretic effect is described, due to the reduced outflow from the renal pelvis into the ureter 8.PathologyPUJ obstruction is most commonly unilateral but is reported to be bilateral in ~30% (range 10-49%) of cases 10. There is a recognized predilection towards the left side (~67% of cases).During embryogenesis, the pelviureteric junction forms usually around the fifth week and the initial tubular lumen of the ureteric bud become recanalized by ~10-12 weeks. The PUJ area is the last to recanalize. Inadequate canalization is thought to be the main embryological explanation of a PUJ obstruction. Extrinsic obstructions secondary to bands, kinks, and aberrant vessels also are commonly encountered.Etiology  congenital (neonatal) idiopathic and often unknown; proposed causes include abnormal muscle arrangement at the PUJ anomalous collagen collar at PUJ ischemic insult to PUJ region urothelial ureteral fold   extrinsic ureter compression or encasementcrossing vessel (at PUJ)     adult  preceding renal pelvic trauma  obstructing calculus immediately distal to PUJ previous pyelitis with scarring intrinsic malignancy, e.g. upper tract urothelial carcinoma  extrinsic ureter compression or encasement fibrosis crossing vessel (at PUJ) malignancy  aortic aneurysm 11      Associations in congenital cases, some renal tract abnormalities are recognized renal duplication multicystic dysplastic kidneys   horseshoe kidney or cross fused ectopia    in ~40% of cases, an aberrant, accessory, or early-branching lower pole segment vessel is found and observed to compress the ureter, causing mechanical obstruction Radiographic featuresFluoroscopy/IVUTraditionally intravenous urography/pyelography (IVP/IVU) has been performed for assessing for PUJ obstruction. The administration of furosemide may be used to assist in confirming the diagnosis, in particular, to exclude a dilated non-obstructed upper collecting system (so-called 'baggy pelvis').Ultrasound will often show a dilated renal pelvis with a collapsed proximal ureter Doppler sonography: the obstructed kidneys may show higher resistive indices  CTMay show evidence of hydronephrosis +/- caliectasis with collapsed ureters. Useful for assessing crossing vessels at the PUJ, especially when surgical intervention is planned 5,7.Renal scintigraphyRenal scintigraphy can quantitate the degree of obstruction:  99mTc-MAG3: Agent of choice due to a high extraction rate, which may be necessary for an obstructed system. Diuretic (furosemide) renogram is performed to evaluate between obstructive vs. nonobstructive hydronephrosis. The non-obstructive hydronephrosis will demonstrate excretion (downward slope on renogram) after administration of diuretic from the collecting system. Whereas mechanical obstructive hydronephrosis will show no downward slope on renogram, with retained tracer in the collecting system.  99mTc-DTPA: Not the agent of choice because of predominantly glomerular filtration of 99mTc-DTPA. Glomerular function declines earlier and more rapidly than does tubular function in obstructive uropathy. 99mTc-DTPA may be used if the kidney is known to have a good renal function. Treatment and prognosisTreatment depends on the underlying cause. In a majority of congenital cases, the condition is benign, and usually, no intervention is required. However, when there is a definitive structural obstruction (commonly adult cases), surgical intervention with pyeloplasty or stenting may be necessary.Differential diagnosisGeneral imaging differential considerations include:  congenital megacaliectasiscentral renal pelvis tends to be relatively collapsed   extrarenal pelviscalyces are not prominently distended   parapelvic cyst when multiple can be indistinguishable on US or non-contrasted CT IVP confirms normal pelvicalyceal system in between the cysts

__label__Vascular Penetrating atherosclerotic ulcers (PAU) are a pathology that involves the aortic wall. Along with aortic dissection and aortic intramural hematoma they can form the spectrum known as acute aortic syndrome.  On this page:  Article: Epidemiology Clinical presentation Pathology Radiographic features Treatment and prognosis History and etymology Differential diagnosis Related articles References   Images: Cases and figures Imaging differential diagnosis   EpidemiologyTypically, penetrating atherosclerotic ulcers are seen in older male patients with a history of hypertension (up to 92%), smoking (up to 77%) and coronary artery disease (up to 46%) as well as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (24-68%) 1.Penetrating atherosclerotic ulcers account for ~7.5% (range 2.3-11%) of all cases of acute aortic syndrome 1. In ~50% (range 42-61%) of cases, there are concurrent aortic aneurysms, most often in the abdomen 1.Clinical presentationTypically patients present with symptoms of an acute aortic syndrome, namely acute intense chest pain, often described as tearing, ripping, migrating or pulsating 1,8.Some of the patients with penetrating atherosclerotic ulcers are asymptomatic and the diagnosis is made incidentally. In the previously cited article they cite the Mayo Clinic series in which just 75% of the patients had been symptomatic 2.PathologyThe term "penetrating atherosclerotic ulcer" describes an ulcerating atherosclerotic lesion that penetrates the intima and progresses into the media. In the early stages, the lesions just ulcerate the intima and are often asymptomatic. With further progression, they ulcerate the media and lead to a hematoma of variable size within the media 3.The penetrating atherosclerotic ulcer can resolve completely or stay stable, but they can also lead to aortic dissection, aortic saccular aneurysms and even spontaneous aortic rupture. There are conflicting reports about the most common course of penetrating atherosclerotic ulcers 1.LocationThere is a greater predilection to involve the mid to distal thoracic aorta 6.Radiographic featuresCTOn CT aortography, the typical finding is a contrast-filled, out-pouching of the wall of the aorta or into the thickened aortic wall in absence of an intimal flap or a false lumen. The protrusion is said to resemble a mushroom 14. These can progress to an intramural hematoma. Often there are signs of extensive atherosclerosis in other sites apart from the ulceration 4. Usually, the ulcer is found in the descending part of the thoracic aorta. Ulcers of the aortic arch are less common, and rare in the ascending aorta 4.Although associated pleural effusion correlates with clinical instability there are no validated imaging features for prediction of the course of a PAU 1. It is often difficult to determine if a PAU is the source of a patient's pain or if it is an incidental finding.In follow-up studies increasing maximum diameter and depth of the ulcer is an obvious sign of progression 1. However, there is currently no consensus for ulcer depth or diameter that warrants treatment 14.Transesophageal echocardiography usually, transesophageal echocardiography demonstrates a localized, crater-like protrusion of the aortic lumen into the thickened aortic wall 9  often there are signs of extensive atherosclerosis in other sites apart from the ulceration 9  MRI and MRA T1-weighted SE sequences show a hyperintense hematoma in acute or subacute disease and can distinguish between hematoma and atherosclerotic plaque 9  otherwise similar findings to CTA 9  DSA the typical finding is a contrast-filled, pouch-like protrusion of the aortic lumen 9  mostly several oblique projections are required 9  Treatment and prognosisNo set guidelines on when to treat and practices vary between hospitals, however the general consensus is as follows:  ascending aorta although the involvement of the ascending aorta in penetrating atherosclerotic ulcers is rare, the ulcers usually rupture therefore early/urgent or emergent surgical intervention is recommended 4     descending aorta asymptomatic:may initially be managed with an aggressive (antihypertensive) medical therapy in combination with close clinical and radiographic follow-upannual CT imaging follow-up has been suggested 10    symptomatic or signs of progression: higher risk for spinal cord ischemia  endovascular stent-grafting (TEVAR) 4       iliac arteries generally asymptomatic/incidental and slow-growing 15  mortality is determined by concurrent co-morbidities such as concurrent aortic aneurysm   ComplicationsRecognized complications include: transmural aortic rupture embolic phenomena pseudoaneurysm formation progressive aneurysmal dilatation History and etymologyThey were first described as a distinct clinical and pathological entity by Stanson et al. in 1986 3. Differential diagnosisGeneral imaging differential considerations include: focal indentation as part of irregularity along mural aortic plaque: could represent a non-penetrating atheromatous ulcer. aortic intramural hematoma aortic dissection saccular aneurysm  (thoracic) aortic injury 
__label__Chest __label__Trauma __label__Forensic Penetrating thoracic trauma, namely gunshot and stab injuries, vary widely in incidence globally but nevertheless result in high mortality and serious morbidity. CT is the modality of choice in imaging these patients and can reduce the need for surgical exploration. PathologyPenetrating thoracic trauma most commonly affects the chest wall, pleura and lungs (up to 97%) with precordial and periclavicular injuries less common 1. Accurate identification of the entry site(s) is important, although it should be noted that the wound tract can appear remote due to respiratory motion. Radiographic featuresPlain radiographIn the typical trauma setting a supine AP radiograph is acquired. Despite the inherent limitations of this technique, many pathologies can be easily identified 2:  pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum, hemothorax, subcutaneous emphysema  pulmonary opacities representing contusion, laceration, etc abnormal cardiomediastinal contour representing hematoma from cardiac or mediastinal injury rib fractures foreign bodies, e.g. bullets/bullet fragments, knife blade CTIn a stable patient, contrast-enhanced CT is the modality of choice to assess for thoracic injuries. CT can be used to delineate the wound track and identify any foreign bodies (e.g. bullets). In addition to injuries seen on plain radiography, CT is more sensitive in assessing for 1,3: mediastinal injuries esophageal injury tracheal injury  cardiac injury most commonly present with cardiac tamponade   right ventricle most commonly injured    thoracic aortic injury (uncommon)   detecting small pneumothorax/hemothorax not seen on plain radiographs  subclavian artery injury diaphragmatic injury 
__label__Head __label__& __label__Neck __label__Trauma Penetrating traumatic neck injury can be a potentially devastating injury due to the high density of crucial anatomical structures within the neck.  On this page:  Article: Epidemiology Pathology Radiographic features Treatment and prognosis See also References   Images:Cases and figures  EpidemiologyYoung males are highly represented in patients with a traumatic neck injury. In one study, 11:1 ratio of males to females were identified in patients with penetrating neck injury 3.PathologyClassificationThe neck has traditionally been divided into three anatomic zones when describing penetrating neck trauma, which guides clinical management 2:  zone 1: from the level of the clavicles and sternal notch to the cricoid cartilageimportant structures include the aortic arch, proximal common carotid arteries, vertebral arteries, subclavian vessels, innominate vessels, lung apices, esophagus, trachea, brachial plexus and thoracic duct    zone 2: from the cricoid cartilage to the angle of the mandibleimportant structures include the common, internal and external carotid arteries, internal and external jugular veins, larynx, hypopharynx and proximal esophagus   zone 3: from the angle of the mandible to base of skullimportant structures include the internal carotid artery, vertebral artery, external carotid artery, jugular veins, prevertebral venous plexus and facial nerve trunk  Injuries mostly (~80%) occur in zone 2. ~10% of injuries involve two zones 5. Radiographic featuresAssessment of neck injuries has been aided by the use of CT angiography. Types of injury include vascular injury, esophageal perforation, laryngeal trauma and neurological injury.Treatment and prognosisTreatment of neck injury depends on the severity of injury and the zones of the neck which are involved. Previously, zone 2 injuries penetrating the platysma were thought to require immediate surgical exploration. One current study suggests that thorough clinical examination can prevent unnecessary surgical exploration of zone 2 neck injuries. Clinical criteria which would indicate surgical intervention/exploration include: exsanguinating hemorrhage expanding hematoma shock airway compromise massive subcutaneous hematoma Zone I and III injuries are evaluated more selectively, particularly due to the difficulty in their surgical accessibility 4.While endovascular techniques have seen increasing use in other traumatic vascular injuries, open surgical repair is considered the gold standard for most vascular neck trauma. One study suggests that patients with stable, intimal, high zone 3 carotid injuries and vertebral artery injuries can be repaired endovascularly. Otherwise, surgical exploration is the intervention of choice.See alsoblunt traumatic neck injury

__label__Urogenital __label__Trauma Penile fracture or rupture is a rare event, however, requires emergency diagnosis and intervention. It is a rupture of penile tunica albuginea of the corpora cavernosa or spongiosum caused by trauma to an erect penis, most commonly during sexual intercourse. The urologist needs to know whether the tunica albuginea is ruptured and if the rupture extends to the urethra to determine if an emergent surgical exploration is indicated. On this page:  Article: Clinical presentation Pathology Radiographic features Treatment and prognosis References   Images:Cases and figures  Clinical presentationPatients typically have a characteristic history of trauma in an erect penis: a 'crack' may be heard with associated severe pain, loss of erection and a suddenly swollen penis.PathologyDuring an erection the tunica albuginea thins and thus it is susceptible to mechanical injury. The corpora cavernosa is injured as soon as tunica albuginea is breached. However, urethral injury is associated only with a very severe injury.LocationFractures usually occur in distal two-thirds of the penis 1.ClassificationShukla et al. 5 proposed an ultrasound-based grading system of penile rupture that is helpful in defining the extent of the injury.Radiographic featuresEmergency ultrasound is usually the initial imaging modality, but because the penis is often markedly swollen and painful, it may not be worthwhile. MRI of the penis is the most useful study to determine the extent of injury. A retrograde urethrogram may be of use in the post-operative period particularly if there is urethral involvement.UltrasoundThe tunica albuginea is usually seen as a hyperechoic linear band in the penis covering the corpora cavernosa and the corpus spongiosum. A hypoechoic breach in this band of fibrous tissue may be seen especially along the penile longitudinal axis. An associated collection or hematoma may also be seen alongside the breach.MRITunica albuginea is a hypointense band on all sequences. A tear can be seen as T2 hyperintense breach. MRI can accurately determine if the fracture is transversely or longitudinally oriented. It can also accurately depict the depth and extent of the tear.FluoroscopyCavernosographyThis invasive interventional procedure is often avoided but may depict the tear in corpora cavernosa.Retrograde urethrographyUrethral rupture or post-traumatic stricture can be depicted by this imaging.Treatment and prognosisIf there is no tunica albuginea rupture, the injury can be managed non-operatively. However, in cases of tunica albuginea rupture, it is better to explore surgically and repair the tunica, to reduce the chances of fibrous plaque formation or angulated penis 1. Urethral injury should always be chosen for exploration and urethral repair as early as possible.
__label__Urogenital A simple grading system for penile fracture has been developed but it is not widely used or validated nor recognized by relevant urological surgical societies. Regardless, this system which relies on ultrasound assessment of the tunica albugenia, corpora of the penis, urethra and other fascia 1 helps the sonorgapher and radiologist focus on key structures.Grading  grade 0: intact tunica albugenia with a hematoma superficial or deep to Buck's fascia  grade I: defect in the tunica albugenia and/or corpora cavernosa  grade II: defect in the tunica albuginea and/or corpora cavernosum with associated peri-albugineal and/or cavernosal hematoma  grade III: defect in the tunica albuginea, Buck fascia (with hematoma) and the corpus spongiosum  grade IV: involvement of corpus spongiosum with urethra and/or vascular injury, with any vascular malformation

On this page:  Article: Gross anatomy Arterial supply Venous drainage Lymphatic drainage Innervation Development Variant anatomy Related pathology Related articles References   Images:Cases and figures  Gross anatomyThe gross anatomy of the penis can be divided into five sections: Skin loosely connected to the tunica albuginea distally folded to form the prepuce (foreskin) at the corona of the penis the internal layer of the prepuce is continuous with the neck and continues over the glans to the external urethral orifice the frenulum is a median fold of skin at the urethral aspect of the glans running between the orifice and the deep surface of the prepuce Rootconsists of three cylindrical structures of erectile tissue:  penile crura (paired) attach to the pubic arch. These join towards the symphyseal border and continue as the corpora cavernosa. the bulb of the penis is a median structure found between the crura and is attached to the perineal membrane. It narrows to continue as the corpus spongiosum. The urethra pierces its deep aspect to traverse the bulb as the bulbar urethra and continues to the corpus spongiosum.  Body consists of three erectile structures, which are continuations of the structures described above: the corpora cavernosa (right and left) and the corpus spongiosum (median) during an erection, these cylinders become engorged with blood the urethra courses through the corpus spongiosum and opens at the tip of the penis (glans) via the meatus two suspensory ligaments support the body - fundiform and triangular ligaments Corpus cavernosum paired dorsal structures, encased in the tunica albuginea but separated by a median fibrous septum the urethral aspect has a wide groove where the corpus spongiosum lies a dorsal groove houses the deep dorsal vein ends distally at the proximal part of the glans penis Corpus spongiosum lies ventrally in the groove of the corpus cavernosum contains the penile part of the urethra (continuation of the bulbar part of the urethra), being approximately 15 cm in length cylindrical in shape and expands distally to become the glans penis. The glans curves dorsally over the distal corpus cavernosum. The corona gland projects from the base of the glans and contain multiple preputial glands (as well as on the penile neck) which secrete sebaceous smegma. Arterial supplyIt is derived mainly from branches of the internal pudendal artery:  perineal artery(together with the posterior scrotal and inferior rectal arteries) supplies the tissues between the anus and penile bulb  branches of the common penile artery artery of the bulb of the penis (bulbourethral artery)supplies the corpus spongiosum and the bulbourethral glands    cavernosal artery (deep artery of the penis) divide within the trabeculae of the corpus cavernosum to either end in capillary networks or branch into helicine arteries (most seen in the posterior region of the corpus cavernosum). erection is caused by a rapid flow from the helicine arteries into the corpus cavernosum. This distension further contributes to the erection as the venous outflow is obstructed.    dorsal artery of the penis supplies the corpus spongiosum supplies penile skin by some branches coursing through the dartos layer supplies the tunica albuginea of the corpus cavernosum via a circumflex branch that courses around the shaft of the penis     Venous drainage deep dorsal vein (unpaired) drains the corpus cavernosum and corpus spongiosumit passes through the urogenital diaphragm to enter the pelvis  superficial dorsal vein (unpaired) drains the prepuce and penile skin Lymphatic drainage penile skin: accompanies the external pudendal vessels to the superficial inguinal nodes glans: to deep inguinal and external iliac nodes erectile tissue and penile urethra: to internal iliac lymph nodes Innervation pudendal nerve and pelvic plexuses (S2-4)DevelopmentArises from the genital tubercle (from the cranial end of the cloacal membrane), which lengthens to form the phallus (male and female).

The penumbra sign can help distinguish an acute osteomyelitis from other malignant and benign lesions.The penumbra is the same as the inner ring described by Marti-Bonmati 2. They found that bone abscesses had a characteristic four-layered appearance: a center with low T1 and high T2 signal an inner ring with muscle signal intensity on T1 and low intensity on T2 an outer ring of fibrotic reaction with low signal intensity on T1 and T2, and a peripheral halo of bone marrow edema with low signal intensity on T1 and variable signal intensity on T2

__label__Gastrointestinal Peptic ulcer disease (PUD) encompasses a number of entities, united by the presence of mucosal ulceration secondary to the effects of gastric acid. Since the recognition of Helicobacter pylori as a common causative agent, and the development of powerful anti-acid medications, peptic ulcer disease has become comparatively rare in western populations.  On this page:  Article: Epidemiology Clinical presentation Pathology Radiographic features Treatment and prognosis References   Images:Cases and figures  EpidemiologyGenerally peptic ulcer disease is encountered more frequently in males (M:F 3:1) 2 and usually in the older population. Risk factors include 2,4:  Helicobacter pylori infection NSAIDs corticosteroids severe physiological stress/illness (e.g. admission to intensive care) Zollinger-Ellison syndrome The majority of cases are due to infection with Helicobacter pylori. This can be confirmed with biopsies obtained at endoscopy and urea breath test, the combination of the two resulting in a detection rate of close to 100% 4. Clinical presentationTypically patients with upper abdominal pain and discomfort which is epigastric in location and 'gnawing' in character 2. Classically it is relieved by eating or antacids. Presentation may also be with one of a number of complications, including 1:  upper gastrointestinal tract hemorrhage most common complication affecting 14% of ulcer patients 1  most common cause of upper gastrointestinal tract hemorrhage variable presentation incidental: fecal occult blood positive test acute presentation:   melena/hematochezia (20%)  hematemesis (30%) both melena and hematemesis (50%)       perforation affects up to 6% of ulcer patients 1  generalized acute abdominal pain, peritonism and shock 2  pain may radiate to the right shoulder and back 2  pain may prominently be in the right iliac fossa (Valentino syndrome) 5     gastric outlet obstructionuncommon, only seen in ~1% of ulcer patients 1   PathologyPeptic ulceration represents the common end-point of any number of processes which result in a disruption of the normal balance between gastric acid production and protective mechanisms of the mucosa. Regardless of the underlying cause, acid initially results in inflammation and later superficial erosions and eventually frank ulceration. Heliocobacter pylori, a spiral gram negative bacterium has been identified as the leading cause of duodenal ulceration 2. Radiographic featuresAlthough historically barium studies were the mainstay of investigation for suspect peptic ulceration, endoscopy has in most centers largely replaced the barium meal. Many current younger radiologists/training radiologists have rarely if ever performed a full diagnostic barium meal, and the 'art' of this examination is gradually being lost. In the acute setting CT is the modality of choice for assessing a patient with acute abdominal pain, and in some settings may be able to identify the site of bleeding prior to endoscopy. Plain radiographAbdominal films have little role in the setting of vague/chronic upper abdominal pain, and have a very low yield. In the acute setting an erect chest x-ray is invaluable as it not only often allows the diagnosis of pneumoperitoneum to be made with confidence, but also gives treating clinicians important information of the patients general health (e.g. cardiomegaly, aspiration pneumonia, pulmonary metastases). FluoroscopyBarium meals are performed with liquid barium and an effervescent to distend the stomach with gas and allow a 'double contrast' image. Features of ulceration include 2,3:  pocket of barium filling the ulcer crater 85% round; 15% linear 10-15% of ulcers are multiple postbulbar ulcers should raise the possibility of Zollinger-Ellison syndrome especially if ulcers are multiple and gastric folds are thickened    edematous collar of swollen mucosa (to be distinguished from the rolled edges of a malignant ulcer) radiating folds of mucosa away from the ulcer For more details, see gastric ulcer evaluation (barium).CTIdeal technique and findings depends on the presentation. Perforation is usually a straightforward diagnosis, often with abundant pneumoperitoneum visible. The site of perforation is sometimes visible as a region of discontinuity in the stomach or duodenal wall. Hemorrhage can be challenging to identify and requires a multi-phase scan without positive oral contrast (typically non-contrast, arterial and delayed phase scans are obtained) and the presence of active bleeding. Extravasation and pooling/accumulation of contrast into the lumen of the bowel may be seen. Treatment and prognosisTreatment depends on the clinical presentation. Historically emergent surgery for peptic ulcers was not uncommon, however the discovery of H. pylori and the ensuing revolution in management of the condition means that surgery is now rare as a first-line therapy.Dyspeptic symptomsWhen dyspeptic symptoms lead to identification of upper gastrointestinal ulceration (usually via endoscopy) patients are typically treated with acid lowering medications and tested for Helicobacter pylori, which if found is then eradicated. This is important not only to prevent recurrence of peptic ulceration and reflux esophagitis but also because it is associated with a number of malignancies including B-cell lymphoma and gastric adenocarcinoma 4.  Upper gastrointestinal hemorrhageAcute presentation with upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage requires expedient resuscitation, especially as the affected population is often relatively frail and hypotension/shock can lead to other medical sequelae (e.g. myocardial infarction, intestinal ischemia). In most cases, emergency endoscopy is then performed not only to identify the source of bleeding but also potentially to treat the source of bleeding. Treatments include 1:  thermal coagulation/electrocoagulation injection vasoconstrictors (e.g. epinephrine/epinephrine) sclerosing agents (e.g. alcohol) coagulants (e.g. thrombin/fibrin)   mechanical hemoclips band ligation endoloop    PerforationPerforation is a surgical emergency and in the vast majority of patients, laparotomy and repair of the perforation is performed. 
__label__Gastrointestinal This is a basic article for medical students and other non-radiologistsPeptic ulcer disease encompasses a number of entities that are the result of gastric mucosal ulceration secondary to the effects of gastric acid. Since the recognition of Helicobacter pylori as a common causative agent and the development of powerful anti-acid medications, peptic ulcer disease has become comparatively rare in western populations.  On this page:  Article: Reference article Summary Role of imaging Radiographic features Related articles   Images:Cases and figures  Reference articleThis is a summary article; read more in our article on peptic ulcer disease.Summary  anatomy stomach   epidemiology older population with M:F ratio of 3:1 main risk factors H. pylori NSAID and corticosteroid use severe physical stress      presentation dyspeptic symptoms hemorrhage (14%) incidental (fecal-occult blood) acute (melena, hematemesis, or both)   perforation (6%) gastric-outlet obstruction (rare)    pathophysiologymucosal ulceration secondary to gastric acid   investigation endoscopy if the test of choice to confirm ulceration and biopsy radiology of limited use hemorrhage is challenging to detect even with multi-phase CT    treatment dyspepsia: anti-acid medication hemorrhage: treat the source, e.g. vasoconstrictor injection perforation: surgery   Role of imagingThere is limited use of imaging in the dyspeptic patient.Radiographic featuresCTIn the acute setting, patients may have a CT abdomen if they present with pain and perforation is not difficult to identify.

Bile can then be aspirated for microbiological studies. A 0.035 guidewire is used to exchange the needle for a dilator and an 8 French or larger pigtail drain is placed within the gallbladder. The drain can often be visualized under ultrasound. Aspiration of bile/pus from the drain confirms satisfactory position. Trocar techniqueLoad 8 French locking pigtail catheter over trocar. Advance the catheter assembly into gallbladder lumen by sonographic guidance; it is possible to visualize tip in gallbladder lumen. Aspiration of bile/pus from the drain confirms satisfactory position. Unscrew trocar from catheter; advance catheter off of trocar into gallbladder, then remove trocar and lock pigtail. Postprocedural careBed rest (typically 2-4 hours) with regular monitoring of vital signs and provision of adequate analgesia are routinely indicated in the first few hours following the procedure. Catheter is flushed and aspirated regularly with saline (6 to 8 hourly). A cholecystogram (injection of contrast into the indwelling catheter under fluoroscopy), performed when the patient is stable, helps establish satisfactory catheter position and the state of the gallbladder. It also allows assessment of any residual calculi in the biliary tree. The catheter can be removed once the tract is mature (usually 3-4 weeks). A trial of clamping the catheter for 24 hours is usually done prior to removing the catheter.Taking into account age and comorbidities, cholecystectomy after resolution of cholecystitis is normally performed in order to prevent recurrent cholecystitis. 9Complications catheter displacement/migration (most common) bile leakage and biliary peritonitis (see: biloma) bleeding bowel injury (transperitoneal puncture) bradycardia and hypotension from gallbladder manipulation See also  percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography (PTC) other liver and biliary interventional procedures cholecystitis 
__label__Gastrointestinal Percutaneous endoscopic colostomy (PEC) is a procedure used to treat recurrent sigmoid volvulus and large bowel dysmotility (e.g. pseudo-obstruction) in those individuals deemed too high risk for conventional surgery, or for whom standard therapies have failed to provide adequate improvement.It is thought that the mechanism by which percutaneous endoscopic colostomy works is two-fold: conduit to decompress/wash-out colon stabilizes colonic position, "fixing" it in place (cf. colopexy)  On this page:  Article: Indications Contraindications Procedure Complications History and etymology References   Indications recurrent sigmoid volvulus colonic pseudo-obstruction megacolon constipatory/defecatory problems refractory to standard treatments Contraindications abdominal wall infection/sepsis ischemic colitis bowel obstruction ProcedureThe technique is very similar to inserting a PEG. It uses a colonoscope to reach the desired point in the colon for the percutaneous endoscopic colostomy (PEC) tube. The light on the endoscope transilluminates the skin overlying the colon and the PEC is inserted percutaneously at this location. Complications peritonitis colonic perforation infection pain at the insertion site leakage from PEC tubal erosion granuloma formation History and etymologyPercutaneous endoscopic colostomy was originally described in 1986 by Jeffrey L Ponsky, an American endoscopic surgeon, who had previously been the co-developer of percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) 1,2.
__label__Oncology __label__Gastrointestinal __label__Interventional Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) is a procedure where a flexible feeding tube (commonly known as a PEG tube) is inserted through the abdominal wall and into the stomach. This may be placed under endoscopic or radiological guidance, in the latter, the procedure may be known as a percutaneous radiological gastrostomy (PRG) or radiologically inserted gastrostomy (RIG).A PEG tube permits nutrition, fluids and/or medications to be placed directly into the stomach, bypassing the mouth and esophagus. This is typically performed when a patient is either unable to, or it is unsafe for them to, consume nutrition orally.On occasion it is necessary to image for complications of PEG tubes - either immediately after insertion or when long standing. The typical clinical problem relates to concerns over displacement, including buried bumper syndrome.Occasionally contrast will be injected via the PEG to determine its position, a so-called PEGogram.History and etymologyPEG was originally co-developed by two Americans, pediatric surgeon, Michael Gauderer, and endoscopic surgeon Jeffrey L Ponsky, both of whom worked at the Rainbow Babies and Children's Hospital in Cleveland, Ohio. The first PEG was performed in 1979 3.See also percutaneous endoscopic jejunostomy (PEJ) percutaneous endoscopic colostomy (PEC)

__label__Urogenital __label__Interventional Percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) is a surgical procedure for the extraction of large renal calculi. It is usually performed in the operating theater either by a urologist or combined urologist-radiologist team. On this page:  Article: Indication Procedure Complications Related articles References   Images:Cases and figures  IndicationPCNL is used to destroy and remove renal calculi, typically over 2 cm in size.ProcedurePCNL is usually performed with the patient in prone position through a posterior calyx. Supine position can also be used, although, much less commonly perhaps due to lack of much experience and also risk of organ injury. Some of the potential advantages of supine position include: easier patient positioning ability to perform simultaneous PCNL and ureteroscopic procedures better control of the airway ComplicationsPCNL can be regarded as an acceptably low morbidity procedure. Some complications include: hemorrhage perforation of the collecting system followed by urine extravasation caused by a guide wire with straight and hard tip; it can be avoided to a large extent by using J-wire with soft and curved tip sepsis colonic perforation, rare (0.5%) ureteral stone vascular injury pneumothorax 
__label__Urogenital __label__Interventional Percutaneous nephrostomy is a technique in which percutaneous access to the kidney is achieved under radiological guidance. The access is then often maintained with the use of an indwelling catheter. On this page:  Article: Indications Contraindications Procedure Complications History and Etymology Related articles References   Images:Cases and figures  IndicationsPercutaneous nephrostomy is usually reserved for when retrograde approaches are unsuccessful or difficult. Clinical settings include: urinary tract obstruction urinary diversion (e.g. ureteric injury; urine leak) access for percutaneous procedures (e.g. stone treatment; antegrade ureteric stenting) diagnostic testing (e.g. antegrade pyelography, Whitaker test) 7  ContraindicationsAbsolute contraindicationsusually noneRelative contraindications uncorrectable bleeding diathesis (abnormal coagulation indices) uncooperative patient severe respiratory disease uncorrected severe hyperkalemia and/or metabolic acidosisurgent haemodialysis can correct metabolic derangement before nephrostomy insertion 7   ProcedurePre-procedure evaluation review all available imaging to confirm the indication for the procedure and assess renal anatomy and establish safe access route to the kidney check full blood count and coagulation profile to assess the risk of hemorrhage obtain informed consent for the procedure obtain good peripheral IV access administer broad-spectrum IV antibiotics 1-4 hours prior to the procedure, if needed; septic patients are often already on parenteral antibiotics PositioningThe procedure is performed with the patient in prone, prone oblique or lateral position, depending on clinical circumstances and patient comfort. Regular monitoring of the vital signs by a suitably trained staff member is recommended during the procedure. Clean skin with antiseptic solution and drape to maintain sterility for the procedure.Equipment ultrasound or fluoroscopy guidance local anesthesia with 1% or 2% lidocaine 18 gauge puncture needle, an alternative would be to use micropuncture set with a 21 or 22 gauge needle 0.035 inch stiff guidewire (an 0.018 guidewire is also used with a micropuncture set) water-soluble contrast media dilators ranging from 7-9 French  pigtail drain (typically 8 French) Medications prophylactic antibiotics - typically a 3rd generation cephalosporin in selected patients, antibiotic use is not routine 3  analgesia (e.g. meperidine; fentanyl) - not routinely used, but can aid in cooperation in selected patients sedation - a short acting benzodiazepine (e.g. midazolam) may be used in selected patients TechniqueTwo common techniques exist. The choice of technique depends on both operator and patient factors. One method utlilises a two- or three-part puncture needle and the other a micro-puncture kit.Using aseptic technique and following infiltration of local anesthetic agent, the calyx (usually posterior calyx at the mid or lower pole) is punctured with an 18 gauge, two-part needle under ultrasound guidance. In the presence of renal tract obstruction, urine drains freely on removal of the stylet from the needle. A small volume of water-soluble contrast material can be injected to confirm correct needle position using fluoroscopy. A 0.035 guidewire is used to exchange the needle for a dilator and typically an 8 French pigtail drain is placed within the renal pelvis over the guidewire. On occasion a 6F or 12F catheter may be used, on an individual case basis. A urine sample can be sent off to the laboratory for microbiological studies. The catheter is left to drain freely.Postprocedural careBed rest (typically 2-4 hours) with regular monitoring vital signs, provision of adequate analgesia are routinely indicated in the first few hours following the procedure. Fluid balance is regularly monitored, particularly in cases of urinary tract obstruction. Indwelling nephrostomy catheters are usually exchanged every three months 4, 7.It is essentially normal for the urine to be partly blood stained for the first 48-72 hours 5.The patient should take great care with the nephrostomy tube, to avoid mal-positioning, despite the internal pigtail of the locked drain, skin anchoring stitch and adhesive plaster. Slippage is not uncommon but if alerted to medical staff early, nephrostomy salvage can be performed without re-puncture.Adequate hydration can prevent early nephrostomy encrustation and obstruction. Nephrostomy exchanges every 3 months are usually recommended.Complications bleeding pneumothorax bowel injury and peritonitis urine leak splenic or liver injury catheter encrustation and obstruction catheter displacement - reported at ~20% after a few months 7  History and EtymologyGoodwin et al first described the technique of percutaneous nephrostomy in 1955 8.
__label__Urogenital __label__Interventional Percutaenous nephrostomy salvage and tube exchange are two procedures undertaken in those with long term nephrostomies. These patients are often either unsuitable or do not wish to have ureteric stenting to relieve their urinary tract obstruction.Nephrostomy salvageNephrostomy salvage is undertaken in those in who an existing nephrostomy becomes partially or completely dislodged. The rate of tube dislodgement is ~20% after a few months 2.The patient presents with either the tube completely out or with a history of poor or no urine output. In those who have had the tube in place for sometime (> 4 weeks) a tract may remain open for a period of time (typically up to 24 hours), through which a new tube may be placed.TechniqueIf the nephrostomy is completely dislodged, a plastic dilator may be placed in the track and a tractogram performed to illustrate if the track remains patent into the renal collecting system. A hydrophilic wire may then be used to enter the collecting system. A plastic dilator may then be passed over the wire, enabling exchange with a stiff wire. A new catheter can then be placed over the wire, avoiding a new procedure and new renal puncture.Nephrostomy tube exchangeTube exchange is performed typically every three months to prevent tube obstruction from encrustation 2. Encrustration can also cause difficulties with tube removal if left for a longer period.TechniqueA nephrostogram is performed to check the catheter position. A stiff wire is passed into the neprostomy upto, but not into, the pigtail. The catheter is gently remove over the wire, with the wire left in the collecting system. A new catheter is then placed over the wire.ComplicationsThere are reports of up to 17% of patients acquiring a bacteremia after routine tube exchange, but it is considered low risk, and many centers do not give prophylactic antibiotics prior to the procedure 1.
__label__Urogenital __label__Interventional Percutaneous renal biopsy, utilizing either ultrasound or CT, allows for an accurate, reliable method of acquiring renal tissue for histopathological assessment.The biopsy may be of a native or transplant kidney. It is divided into two types: non-focal or non-targeted focal or targeted (i.e. directed at a lesion) Either type may be performed as a CT-guided biopsy or as an ultrasound-guided biopsy 1. Recent description has been given of the use of 3D cone beam CT in assisting the biopsy of particularly challenging focal lesions 2.This depends on both patient and operator factors, such as patient body habitus, ability to cooperate and operator experience. Transplant renal biopsy is usually undertaken with ultrasound guidance given its more superficial location in the pelvis.An alternative option for percutaneous CT/US guidance is the transjugular renal biopsy. On this page:  Article: Indications Contraindications Procedure Complications Histopathology Related articles References   Images:Cases and figures  Indications focal lesion non-characterized on diagnostic imaging renal failure with unknown cause (typically a nephropathy) deteriorating renal function in a transplant patient For focal mass lesions, the established indications include: known extra-renal malignancy suspected renal lymphoma  prior to ablation therapy multiple or bilateral renal masses  diagnostic dilemma of infection/malignant mass ContraindicationsThe contraindications must be considered individually in each case. Overall, the most important contraindications are: uncooperative patient uncorrectable bleeding diathesis (abnormal coagulation indices) ProcedureLaboratory parameters for a safe procedureInterventional procedures like renal biopsy require special attention to coagulation indices. There are widely divergent opinions about the safe values of these indices for percutaneous biopsies. The values suggested below were considered based on literature review, whose references are cited below:  complete (full) blood count:platelet > 50000/mm3  (some institutions determine other values between 50000-100000/mm3) 3    coagulation profile:some studies showed that having a normal INR or prothrombin time is no reassurance that the patient will not bleed after the procedure: international normalized ratio (INR) ≤ 1.5 3  normal prothrombin time (PT)/partial thromboplastin time (PTT)    Pre-procedure preparation written informed consent assessment of patient's cooperation for the procedure Equipment single or co-axial needle set: usually an 18 G core biopsy needle 1% lidocaine/lignocaine midazolam (for sedation): select cases only; assess on a case-by-case basis histopathology department pots TechniqueFocal biopsies usually require only a single core. Non-focal biopsies typically require two cores. This influences technique as the latter requires a co-axial needle set.For native or transplant non-focal kidney biopsies, the core is usually taken from the lower pole.Both ultrasound and CT biopsies are normally performed with the patient prone or on occasion on the ipsilateral side up position in CT. Transplant biopsies are performed supine due to the superficial position in the pelvis.CT guidance is preferred for those of larger body habitus. Operator preference plays a part too.After the procedure, a brief assessment for perinephric or intraparenchymal hemorrhage is advised.Post-procedure careBed-rest is advised as well as regular observations for 4 hours (pulse, blood pressure, SpO2) and active questioning of the patient of any pain or hematuria.The observation period should allow an ample opportunity to identify and treat a potential complication in a timely manner to prevent a serious or catastrophic outcome, this varies with each institution's protocol. One large experience review major complications were identified in >90% of cases by 24 hours 4.ComplicationsPercutaneous renal biopsy remains a safe procedure, but the risk of complication is higher in patients with advanced renal insufficiency 4. Some studies have also shown that hypertension and amyloidosis has a significant influence on the complications 5. These patients may benefit from a longer observation period.Complications include: perinephric (retroperitoneal) or intra-renal hematoma  hematuria  arteriovenous fistula or pseudoaneurysm  colonic injury (very rare with image guidance)  pneumothorax (very rare with image guidance) HistopathologyTissue sample adequacyAdequacy depends on the disease in question.In diseases with focal changes (e.g. focal and segmental glomerulosclerosis), at least 10 glomeruli would be optimal.Even diseases with diffuse changes (e.g. membranous glomerulonephritis), show variation in terms of severity, therefore at least 5-10 glomeruli required to properly assess the extent and severity of the disease. At least two biopsy cores with a diameter of at least 1.2 mm are recommended.Histopathological analysisCore 1Fixed in paraffin then used for the following staining procedures for light microscopy:A: Routine stains: Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) Periodic acid-Schiff’s (PAS) Fibrous tissue stain (e.g.elastic van Gieson etc) Silver stain B: Optional stains: Kossa stain (calcifications) Congo red stain (amyloid) C: Immunohistochemistry: IgG, IgA, IgM, C3, C1qCore 2Used for immunofluorescence studies (frozen sections), electron microscopy (fixed in glutaraldehyde) and additional tests.Not every biopsy requires electron microscopy. Some conditions (e.g. Alport’s disease; immunotactoid disease; minimal change nephropathy) require electron microscopy for a definite diagnosis.
__label__Interventional __label__Hepatobiliary Percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage is an interventional radiology procedure undertaken for those with biliary obstruction.It is almost exclusively performed in those with a malignant obstruction, such as cholangiocarcinoma, ampullary and pancreatic malignancies when retrograde access via endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) is not amenable.It is commonly undertaken as part of a palliative biliary stent insertion. Rarely, it is used in the treatment of benign strictures.
__label__Interventional __label__Hepatobiliary Percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography (PTC) is a radiographic technique employed in the visualization of the biliary tree and can be used as the first step in a number of percutaneous biliary interventions (e.g. percutaneous transhepatic biliary stent placement) On this page:  Article: Indications Contraindications Procedure Complications See also Related articles References   Images:Cases and figures  IndicationsPurely diagnostic percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography is performed when other less invasive methods of imaging the biliary tree (e.g. MRCP, ERCP, CT IVC) have proven unsatisfactory. Indications include: failed ERCP / ERCP not feasible (e.g. patients with gastrojejunostomy) biliary system delineation in presence of intra- and extra-hepatic biliary calculi  to identify an obstructive cause of jaundice, and differentiate from medically treatable cause anatomic evaluation of complications of ERCP delineating bile leaks  percutaneous biliary stent placement postoperative stricture dilatation stone removal Contraindications bleeding diathesis gross ascites  biliary tract sepsis ProcedurePreprocedural evaluationBefore beginning the procedure it is imperative that one should evaluate all the available imaging data of the patient and understand the correct indication for this invasive procedure. Routine investigations that need to be looked at are liver function tests, baseline blood investigations like full blood count, coagulation profile (prothrombin time, PTT, INR, and platelet count); if any of these tests are abnormal corrective measures should be taken before the procedure.Positioning/room set upUsually, the procedure is done under local anesthesia with or without sedation (depending upon the patient cooperation). If the PTC is the first step in a likely painful or time consuming percutaneous biliary intervention, then many centers would prefer to have the patient anaesthetized.An IV cannula should be placed to maintain vascular access throughout the procedure. Preprocedural broad-spectrum antibiotics are usually administered via an intravenous route.Routine skin preparation and draping should be performed, exposing a large area overlying the liver, such that a number of trajectories can be employed if need be.Equipment routine trolley pack  Chiba needle (22G, 15 cm long) connecting tube water-soluble iodinated contrast TechniqueThe point of entry of the needle is usually planned by using ultrasound guidance (increasingly used worldwide). A direct fluoroscopic approach was described initially and is still used commonly. A long two-part needle (approximately 15 cm) 22 G is inserted under ultrasound guidance into one of the peripheral ducts; after removing the needle stylet one can observe bile reflux at the needle hub or inject a small amount of contrast to confirm duct puncture on fluoroscopy. Once a satisfactory position of the needle is confirmed, an adequate amount of contrast material is injected and various projections of the biliary tree are obtained to evaluate the obstructive pathology.

When appendicitis is left untreated, necrosis (gangrene) of the appendiceal wall can occur and progress to a focal rupture. On this page:  Article: Epidemiology Clinical presentation Pathology Radiographic features Treatment and prognosis Differential diagnosis Related articles References   Images:Cases and figures  EpidemiologyPerforation of the appendix is more common with advanced age, due to an increased frequency of late and atypical presentation of appendicitis, delay in diagnosis, delayed decision for surgery, and to the age-specific physiological changes 1.Clinical presentationA slight majority of patients with a perforated appendicitis present more than 48 hours after symptom onset 4.PathologyIntraoperative or gross pathology examination reveals a full-thickness defect in the appendiceal wall. Histopathology demonstrates neutrophilic infiltration and transmural necrosis with extensive mucosal ulceration (gangrenous acute appendicitis).Radiographic featuresCTComputed tomography can predict perforation with high specificity (95%) in patients with known appendicitis when certain findings are present 2-6: focal defect in the enhancing appendiceal wall (most sensitive finding but its performance is heterogeneous across studies 7) periappendiceal abscess extraluminal gas (contained locules or free intraperitoneal gas) extraluminal appendicolith extraluminal leak of enteric contrast Less specific findings include 7 periappendiceal phlegmon (severe fat stranding and/or ill-defined fluid collection) ileus ascites UltrasoundAlthough ultrasound is less accurate than a contrast-enhanced CT, the findings can be appreciated in experienced hands. Diagnosis of perforated appendix relies mainly on demonstration of right iliac fossa abscess or phlegmon in association with signs of appendiceal inflammation and appendicolith.Treatment and prognosisManagement of perforated acute appendicitis depends on the clinical stability of the patient and the presence of an abscess. Perforated appendix increases the risk of a postoperative abscess. If the patient is unstable or septic, urgent surgery is indicated. If the patient is stable, however, initial nonoperative management including antibiotics is safe 8. If an abscess is present, imaging-guided percutaneous drainage is prudent. Appendectomy should eventually be performed (unless comorbidities contraindicate elective surgery) to exclude an appendiceal neoplasm and prevent recurrent appendicitis.Differential diagnosis  pelvic inflammatory disease/tubo-ovarian abscess   terminal ileitis with abscess formation (e.g. Crohn disease) cecal diverticulitis epiploic appendagitis perforated cecal and appendiceal carcinoma  
__label__Chest __label__Breast Perforating branches of the internal thoracic arteries arise from the paired internal thoracic arteries (also known as internal mammary arteries) and run in the superior six intercostal spaces. These arteries pierce the internal intercostal muscles and pectoralis major, contributing to the blood supply of these muscles and the overlying skin and fascia 1.They are frequently accompanied by venous perforators and the anterior cutaneous branches of the intercostal nerves; wide variation in their course and length exists between individuals 2,3.During lactation, the second to fourth perforating arteries increase in size to supply the mammary glands 4.
__label__Musculoskeletal The perforating cutaneous nerve is a cutaneous nerve that arises from the S2 and S3 nerve roots of the sacral plexus. The nerve exits the pelvis by piercing the sacrotuberous ligament to eventually supply the lower medial part of the buttock.Gross anatomyOriginThe perforating cutaneous nerve arises from the posterior aspect of the anterior rami of S2 and S3 nerve roots.CourseUnlike the majority of the nerves of the sacral plexus that exit the pelvic cavity through the greater sciatic foramen, the perforating cutaneous nerve pierces the sacrotuberous ligament and is briefly at the posterior edge of the ischioanal fossa. The nerve then passes over the lower border of the gluteus maximus muscle and continues to supply the skin over inferior aspects of the buttocks (also described as the area at which the two buttocks are losing contact).RelationsThe perforating cutaneous nerve briefly runs within the sacrotuberous ligament; a flat, triangular, broad based ligament. The ligament also houses the coccygeal branch of the inferior gluteal artery.The sacrotuberous ligament along with the gluteus maximus muscle forms the posterior boundary of the ischioanal (ischiorectal) fossa a fat filled fossa of the perineum. The ischioanal fossa contains the pudenal canal which in turn contains the pudendal nerve and internal pudendal vessels.Variant anatomyThe perforating cutaneous nerve may be absent in which its place may be taken by a branch from the posterior cutaneous nerve of the thigh, a branch from the pudendal nerve or by a small nerve arising from the third and fourth or fourth and fifth sacral nerves. 
__label__Vascular __label__Musculoskeletal The perforating veins of the lower limb (PV or “perforators”) are so called because they perforate the deep fascia of muscles, to connect the superficial venous systems of the lower extremity to the deep veins where they drain.

__label__Gastrointestinal Perianal fistula (or fistula-in-ano) (plural: fistulae or fistulas) is the presence of a fistulous tract across/between/adjacent to the anal sphincters and is usually an inflammatory condition 4. On this page:  Article: Epidemiology Clinical presentation Pathology Radiographic features Radiology report Treatment and prognosis Differential diagnosis References   Images: Cases and figures Imaging differential diagnosis   EpidemiologyIncidence is estimated at ~1:10,000 1, with a recognized male predilection of 2-4:1.Associations spontaneous  diverticulitis: perhaps the most common cause in developed countries  Crohn diseaseit is unclear if ulcerative colitis is a risk factor for perianal disease 11   other bowel or pelvic infections tuberculosis   iatrogenic: post-surgical complication post-ultralow anterior resection hysterectomy post-pelvic radiotherapy   childbirth pelvic malignancies Clinical presentationSymptoms are variable, including anal pain, tenesmus, pruritus, and sepsis.PathologyThe most commonly accepted pathophysiology is the cryptoglandular hypothesis, which posits that obstruction of the deep submucosal glands results in infection and abscess formation in the intersphincteric space, which consequently drains inferiorly between the sphincters, opening onto the skin surface or, less commonly, erodes through both the internal and external sphincters into the ischiorectal space, then onto the skin surface 4.Transsphincteric fistulae are secondary to ischiorectal abscesses, with a resultant extension of the tract through the external sphincter. Intersphincteric fistulae are due to perianal abscesses. Suprasphincteric fistulae are due to supralevator abscesses.LocationGoodsall's rule states that the internal opening of the fistula is dependent on where the fistula is located relative to the 'anal clock' (i.e. with the patient in the lithotomy position, anterior is 12 o'clock and posterior is 6 o'clock) and the transverse anal line (a line drawn from 9 o'clock to 3 o'clock): if the internal opening is anterior to the transverse anal line there will be a (usually simple) direct radial fistulous tract if the internal opening is posterior to the transverse anal line there will be a tortuous (and often more complex) fistulous tract that enters posteriorly in the midline (6 o'clock) ClassificationSurgical classificationThe Parks classification has become the most widely used surgical classification for distinguishing four types of fistula. The course of the fistula and its relationship to the anal sphincters is described in the coronal plane 4,6,7:  intersphincteric (~70%): fistula crosses the intersphincteric space and does not cross the external sphincter  transsphincteric (25%): fistula crosses from the intersphincteric space, through the external sphincter and into the ischiorectal fossa   suprasphincteric (5%):  fistula passes superiorly into the intersphincteric space, and over the top of the puborectalis muscle then descending through the iliococcygeus muscle into the ischiorectal fossa and then skin  extrasphincteric (1%): fistula crosses from the perineal skin through the ischiorectal fossa and levator ani muscle complex into the rectum (i.e. it is outside the external anal sphincter) Radiological classificationRadiologists have developed another grading system for perianal fistulae, which is based on landmarks on the axial plane and incorporates abscesses and secondary extensions to the grading system, and is called the St James’s University Hospital classification 1:  grade 1: simple linear intersphincteric  grade 2: intersphincteric with abscess or secondary tract  grade 3: transsphincteric  grade 4: transsphincteric with abscess or secondary tract within the ischiorectal fossa  grade 5: supralevator and translevator extension Radiographic featuresFistulographyFistulography is a traditional radiological technique used to define the anatomy of fistulas, yet it is an unreliable technique and is difficult to interpret 1.In fistulography, the external opening is catheterized with a fine cannula, and a water-soluble contrast agent is injected to define the fistulous tract 7. It has two major drawbacks 4: difficult to assess secondary extensions secondary to lack of proper filling with contrast material inability to visualize the anal sphincters and to determine their relationship to the fistula UltrasoundThe benefits of ultrasonography over MRI are the former's ubiquity and lower operating costs 9,10. There are three ultrasonography methods for the evaluation of perianal fistulae, whether cryptoglandular or Crohn disease-associated 8: endoanal ultrasound (EAUS) transvaginal ultrasound (TVUS) transperineal ultrasound (TPUS) These can also be applied in combination. Infusion of hydrogen peroxide into the fistulous tract renders it hyperechoic, thus facilitating its delineation. Doppler interrogation can show hyperemia in active Crohn disease.Endoanal ultrasonography is deemed less sensitive than endoanal MR for deep supralevator disease 10.MRIMRI is the imaging modality of choice. See pelvic MRI protocol for anal canal fistula assessment.Active fistulous tracts are typically:  T1: isointense to muscle  T2: high signal compared to fat  T2-FS: high signal compared to fat  T1 C+: enhancing Old, healed fistulae typically demonstrate low T1 and T2 signal without contrast enhancement, reflecting fibrosis.Radiology report detection of the primary fistulous tract and its activity: active tract has high T2 signal and demonstrates intense enhancement chronic tracts have low signal on both T1- and T2-WI and will not show contrast enhancement   location (right/left) and course relationship to the sphincter complexParks classification: trans-, inter-, supra-, or extrasphincteric  distance of the internal mucosal defect to the perianal skin on coronal images position of the internal mucosal opening on axial imagesuse the "anal clock": anterior = 12 o'clock  identify secondary fistulous tracts and the sites of any abscess cavities in order to avoid therapeutic failure and recurrence cranial extension above the levator ani muscle Treatment and prognosisThe majority of perianal fistulas related to Crohn disease will not heal spontaneously and require surgical management. Differential diagnosis perianal abscess pilonidal sinus 
__label__Gastrointestinal MRI protocol for the assessment of perianal fistulas is a group of MRI sequences put together to asses the extension and anatomic relationships of inflammatory fistulas to the anal sphincters, helping to plan surgical management and monitor treatment response. NB: This article is intended to outline some general principles of protocol design. The specifics will vary depending on MRI hardware and software, radiologist's and referrer's preferences, institutional protocols, patient factors (e.g. allergy) and time constraints.SequencesA good protocol for this purpose would include:fine 3 mm slices axial and coronal T2 FS or STIR axial and coronal T2 are helpful in the delineation of sphincter anatomy axial and coronal T1 FS with gadolinium-based intravenous contrast material axial T1  Some authors recommend 1: short-inversion-time inversion recovery (STIR) gradient-echo T1-weighted with or without gadolinium-based intravenous contrast material spin-echo T1-weighted spin-echo T2-weighted with saline instillation (MR fistulography) A novel method is the use of volume MRI sequences (more routinely used in neuro and musculoskeletal MRI). The benefits are reduced imaging times and isotropic data allowing multiplanar reformatting while maintaining comparable contrast resolution.

__label__Head __label__& __label__Neck Periapical cysts, also known as radicular cysts, are the most frequent cystic lesion related to teeth (see mandibular lesions) and result from infection of the tooth.On imaging, they generally appear as a round- or pear-shaped, unilocular, lucent lesion in the periapical region, measuring <1 cm.  On this page:  Article: Epidemiology Pathology Radiographic features Differential diagnosis See also  Related articles References   Images: Cases and figures Imaging differential diagnosis   EpidemiologyPeriapical cysts are typically seen in middle to older age (3rd to 6th decades) 2.PathologyPeriapical cysts result from infection of the tooth, which spreads to the apex and into the adjacent bone. This leads to apical periodontitis, granuloma formation and eventual cyst formation. These cysts are therefore centered on the apex of the tooth and tend to be small, most <1 cm. There is also unsurprisingly usually overt evidence of caries.Radiographic featuresPlain radiograph and CTMost radicular cysts appear as round- or pear-shaped, unilocular, lucent lesions in the periapical region 3. They are usually <1 cm in diameter and are bordered by a thin rim of cortical bone. The associated tooth usually has a deep restoration or large carious lesion. Caries will appear as erosion of the enamel/crown of the associated tooth.MRIMRI is not the first-line imaging modality but periapical cysts appear as a non-enhancing lesion at the apex of a tooth. These cysts typically return low T1 signal and high T2 signal.Differential diagnosis  periapical abscessinflammation involves tooth root apex  periapical granuloma  dentigerous cystlesion around the crown of an unerupted/impacted tooth   keratocystic odontogenic tumor  See also periapical radiolucenency

__label__Central __label__Nervous __label__System Periaqueductal grey (PAG) matter is a column of grey matter that surrounds the cerebral aqueduct of Sylvius in the midbrain. The PAG extends from the superior border of the midbrain (which forms the posterior aspect of the floor of the third ventricle), inferiorly towards the fourth ventricle and the superior medullary velum. The mesencephalic nucleus and the mesencephalic root of the trigeminal nerve are found lateral to the PAG. The oculomotor nerve nucleus and the nucleus of Edinger–Westphal are found anterior to the PAG.The periaqueductal grey matter participates in the spinomesencephalic tract by way of descending modulation of nociceptive transmission. Recent research has demonstrated that the PAG is involved in the primary-process emotional networks (those subcortical functions that constitute the primary affective processes in the mammalian brain) and contributes to neural circuits for empathy.

Rare cases of mass effect have been described resulting in obstructive jaundice 2,4.PathologyHistologically, peribiliary cysts have benign-appearing columnar or cuboidal epithelial cell lining 3,4. They develop as dilatation of glands within the periductal tissue 3. They vary in size and have been shown to gradually increase in size and number over time 3.Radiographic featuresUltrasoundFeatures include well-demarcated cysts (uniform, low echogenicity with posterior acoustic enhancement) of varying size in a hilar distribution. In particular, a positive diagnosis is made with the presence of the cystic dilatation on both sides of the portal veins, whereas dilatation of intrahepatic bile ducts usually appears on one side.

On this page:  Article: Epidemiology Clinical presentation Pathology Radiographic features Related articles References   EpidemiologyIt accounts for only 6-13% of internal abdominal hernias.Clinical presentationClinical symptoms are often characterized by episodes of intense lower abdominal pain, like a colicky right lower quadrant pain very similar to the appendiceal pain, often causing confusion.PathologyFour subtypes (ileocolic, retrocecal, ileocecal, and paracaecal) of herniations occur in the pericaecal fossa (located behind the cecum and ascending colon and is limited by the parietocecal fold outward and the mesentericocecal fold inward). It is due to acquired or congenital defects in the cecal mesentery.Retrocecal hernia is the most common subtype caused by herniation of ileal loops through a defect in the cecal mesentery and the right paracolic gutter.  Radiographic featuresFluoroscopy Delayed radiograph series of the small bowel or a barium enema examination may show retrograde opacification of the terminal ileum.CTThese hernias can often be confidently diagnosed as a cluster of bowel loops (usually ileal) located posteriorly and laterally to the normal cecum, occasionally extending into the right paracolic gutter. In addition, a beaking appearance at the entrance of the hernia, and a dilated afferent small bowel loop and collapsed efferent loop in the transition zone may be seen. There might be evidence of small-bowel obstruction and mass effect displacing the cecum anteriorly and medially.
__label__Vascular __label__Central __label__Nervous __label__System The pericallosal artery is the distal portion of the anterior cerebral artery (ACA) that courses over the superior surface of the body of the corpus callosum in the pericallosal cistern. It gives off many small branches to the corpus callosum, forming the pericallosal moustache.Some authors describe the pericallosal artery as the entire distal portion of the ACA beginning at the anterior communicating artery (segments A2 to A5), therefore even including the portion anterior to the lamina terminalis and the rostrum and genu of the corpus callosum 1,2. Other authors define it as the artery created at the bifurcation of the ACA near the genu of the corpus callosum after giving off the callosomarginal artery 1. However, the latter description is problematic as the callosomarginal artery is not visible on imaging or even absent in a significant minority of cases 1.

It is the most common location for an intracranial lipoma. On this page:  Article: Epidemiology Clinical presentation Pathology Radiographic features Treatment and prognosis Differential diagnosis References   Images: Cases and figures Imaging differential diagnosis   EpidemiologyPericallosal lipomas are rare, found in only 1 in 2,500 to 1 in 25,000 autopsies 6.Clinical presentationApproximately 50% of patients present with seizures 6. The tubulonodular variety (see below) is usually associated with more severe and extensive abnormalities and thus is more frequently symptomatic.With the increasing use of antenatal sonography more and more cases are being detected incidentally in utero. PathologyThe pathogenesis of a pericallosal lipoma is considered to be the result of an abnormal persistence and differentiation of the meninx primitiva into lipomatous tissue 6. Typically resorption occurs between the 8th and the 10th week of gestation. Radiographic featuresPericallosal lipomas can be grouped into two distinct types based on imaging: tubulonodular  curvilinear Tubulonodular lipomaTubulonodular pericallosal lipomas are the more common variety. They are rounded or lobular and usually measure >2 cm in thickness. They are anteriorly situated and are associated with extensive callosal and often fronto-facial anomalies. The tubulonodular variety can extend into the choroid plexus / lateral ventricles 2-3,6. Curvilinear lipomaCurvilinear pericallosal lipomas are usually thin, elongated and curvilinear along the corpus callosum margin. They usually measure <1 cm in thickness and are more posteriorly situated. The corpus callosum is only mildly hypoplastic 2-3,6.In a small minority of pericallosal lipomas, a connection with extracranial subcutaneous lipomas is seen. This may be through a skull defect (cranium bifidum) in which case the masses are continuous with each other, or via a thin fibrous-lipomatous stalk with an apparently intact skull vault 8.UltrasoundUltrasound demonstrates the characteristic appearance of fat: a hyperechoic midline mass in the region of the corpus callosum 5.CTCT is diagnostic, demonstrating fat density mass (-80 to -110HU) 7. Additionally, the tubulonodular variety may show peripheral curvilinear calcification sometimes referred to as the bracket sign on coronal reformatted images.The anterior cerebral vessels can be seen coursing through or above the mass and may have associated vascular malformations or aneurysm formation 6,8. CT angiography may thus be indicated.MRIMRI is the modality of choice to characterize not only the extent of the lipoma but also the frequently associated agenesis/dysgenesis of the corpus callosum.Not surprisingly these masses follow signal intensity of fat on all sequences 2-3,6-7:  T1 markedly hyperintense demonstrates signal attenuation on fat suppression sequences    T2 high signal, but marginally lower than CSF demonstrates signal attenuation on fat suppression sequences but not on FLAIR    T1 C+ (Gd): no enhancement  GE/EPI/SWI: the presence of peripheral calcification leads to blooming Additionally, peripheral chemical shift artifact may be prominent in some sequences. Again, as vascular abnormalities are associated with these lesions, careful examination of the vessels is essential (best seen on T2 FSE sequences).Treatment and prognosisNo specific treatment is usually required 9, although seizures if present need medical management. In the rare cases where a cranium bifidum is present then surgical repair may be necessary. Prognosis is good, but the degree of disability is variable, ranging from severe neurological dysfunction and debilitating seizures to completely asymptomatic.Differential diagnosisIn general, there is little differential as few intracranial masses have significant fatty components. The differential includes: intracranial dermoid cyst intracranial teratoma  fatty falx cerebri: especially to be considered in curvilinear type rare lipomatous transformation of neoplasm: PNET, ependymoma, glioma

__label__Cardiac Pericardial agenesis is a rare condition where there is the absence of the pericardium to varying degrees. If it is only a small portion of the pericardium that is absent it is known as a pericardial defect. On this page:  Article: Epidemiology Clinical presentation  Pathology Radiographic features Treatment and prognosis References   Images:Cases and figures  EpidemiologyAccording to a surgical and pathological series, the prevalence (inclusive of cases with other cardiopulmonary anomalies) is approximately 0.002-0.004% 13.Clinical presentation Most patients are asymptomatic although, in some cases, the anomaly can result in mechanical impairment of cardiac function and even death. Symptomatic patients may present with fatigue, pain (especially non-exertional paroxysmal stabbing chest pain 6) or cardiac conduction abnormalities 9. PathologyPericardial agenesis occurs from premature atrophy of the common cardinal vein. Agenesis can be complete or partial. In partial cases, the absence of the left hemipericardium is more common and results in rotation of the heart towards the left. AssociationsAssociated congenital abnormalities include:  congenital cardiac abnormalities 11 atrial septal defect (ASD) patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) bicuspid aortic valve mitral valve stenosis tetralogy of Fallot   bronchogenic cyst pulmonary sequestration Radiographic featuresPlain radiographChest radiographic findings are usually subtle and non-specific. Features may include:  apparent elevation of the cardiac apex right cardiac border might be indistinct due to leftward displacement and rotation of the heart prominent pulmonary artery segment (PA): both the medial and the lateral borders of the main PA might be seen more clearly as a result of the lack of pericardial reflection between the aorta and the PA lucency caused by the interposition of the lung between the aorta and main pulmonary artery segment the cardiophrenic space is increased on the frontal chest radiograph CT may show the absence of the thin pericardial lining around the heart may demonstrate excessive levoposition of the heart the lateral and posterior portions of the pericardium may be difficult to visualize on CT normally, the aortopulmonary window is covered by pericardium and contains some fat. In the absence of the pericardium, lung tissue can be detected between the aorta and the main segment of the pulmonary artery.  occasionally, there is bulging of the left atrial appendage through the defect may also be useful to assess for certain complication MRICardiac MRI is probably the best method for assessment.Described features include: loss of direct visualization of the pericardium - low signal on T2 levoposition of the heart increased cardiac mobility (e.g. excessive apical motion 11) - on cine sequences interposition of lung tissue between the heart and other intrathoracic structures 5  a "tongue" of lung tissue interposing between the main pulmonary artery and aorta - this is considered a very specific sign 4,13  between the diaphragm and the base of the heart    MRI is also useful to assess for associated complications.Treatment and prognosisAsymptomatic isolated agenesis usually requires no treatment 10. Symptomatic patients who have the complete form may benefit from a pericardioplasty 4.ComplicationsRecognized but uncommon complications include:  cardiac valvular disease, especially insufficiency herniation (in cases with partial agenesis 7) with incarceration of cardiac tissue, which includes atrial appendage entrapment   compression of the left coronary artery secondary to herniation 1  
__label__Chest __label__Vascular Pericardial calcification is usually seen in individual patients with a history of pericarditis and may be associated with constrictive pericarditis.  On this page:  Article: Pathology Radiographic features Treatment and prognosis Differential diagnosis References   Images:Cases and figures  PathologyAlthough historically infective pericarditis was the most common cause, a wide variety of insults can lead to calcification of the pericardium.   pericarditis: tuberculous, fungal, viral or pyogenic previous trauma (hemopericardium)   cardiac surgery collagen vascular diseases: as systemic lupus erythematosus  uremic pericarditis later sequelae of rheumatic heart disease  malignant pericardial involvement (e.g. mediastinal teratoma) post-radiotherapy 5  idiopathic calcified pericardial masse or cyst Radiographic featuresPericardial calcification is more common over the right side, anterior and diaphragmatic aspects of the heart in the atrioventricular grooves 7. Calcifications over the left ventricle or cardiac apex are rare, unless pericardial calcification is extensive. It is important to assess for signs of associated constrictive pericarditis.Plain radiograph a curvilinear density at the extreme margin of the cardiac silhouette (better on lateral view) extension of calcification over the pulmonary outflow tract (better on lateral view) dilated ​left atrium: due less pericardial investment, even with pericardial constriction, mimicking mitral stenosis Tuberculous calcifications are the most dense, in the atrioventricular grooves and appear as thick, amorphous oblique circles or arcs of calcifications then spread over the atria and ventricles 7.Treatment and prognosisMedical management is ineffective, and surgical resection of the diseased pericardium is usually performed.Differential diagnosisThe differential diagnosis for pericardial calcifications include:  constrictive pericarditis: in the setting of heart failure with concern for constrictive pericarditis or restrictive cardiomyopathy, calcifications are highly suggestive of the former  chronic adhesive pericarditis in the absence of constriction: less dense with a more patchy distribution 1   rheumatic pericarditis 2   myocardial calcification: more left-sided and localized calcification (e.g. over the cardiac apex from prior infarction) 3,6  
__label__Cardiac Pericardial cysts are uncommon benign congenital anomalies of the anterior and middle mediastinum. On this page:  Article: Clinical presentation Pathology Radiographic features Treatment and prognosis Differential diagnosis References   Images:Cases and figures  Clinical presentationUsually asymptomatic and discovered incidentally although occasionally may present with chest pain and dyspnea.PathologyThey are thought to often result from aberrations in the formation of coelomic cavities. They can occur as sequelae of previous pericarditis. The cyst wall is composed of connective tissue and a single layer of mesothelial cells, and usually contains clear fluid.LocationThey are most commonly found on the right side, in particular the right anterior cardiophrenic angle, but can be found almost anywhere adjacent to the heart. Variants wandering pericardial cyst 8 Radiographic featuresPlain radiographTypically seen as a mass-like density at the cardiophrenic sulcus. They can be of different shapes and are not always round. May change in shape and size with inspiration and position.CTUsually appears as a well-defined, non-enhancing, fluid-attenuation, rounded mass next to the pericardium.MRIMorphology again can be variable. Internal septations may be present. Signal characteristics are those of fluid and include 4:  T1: typically low signal (occasionally can be high signal if contains proteinaceous material)  T2: high signal  T1 C+ (Gd): no enhancement Treatment and prognosisThey are benign lesions. Surgical resection or aspiration may be performed for symptomatic selected cases 6-7.Differential diagnosis pericardial diverticulum 9 As general differential on cross sectional imagingcystic mediastinal massesOn a chest radiograph also consider: pericardial fat pad thymic lesion mediastinal teratoma Morgagni hernia 
__label__Cardiac __label__Chest Pericardial diverticula are focal outpouching arising from the pericardium. They are differentiated from congenital pericardial cysts by the presence of direct communication with the pericardial cavity. They can change in size related to body position, with symptoms related to the change in position of the patient.Differential diagnosisThe differentials to be considered may include :   pericardial cysts   bronchogenic cysts   thymic cysts  aortic aneurysm 
__label__Cardiac Pericardial effusions occur when excess fluid collects in the pericardial space (a normal pericardial sac contains approximately 30-50 mL of fluid). On this page:  Article: Epidemiology Clinical presentation Pathology Radiographic features Treatment and prognosis Differential diagnosis See also References   Images:Cases and figures  EpidemiologyThere is no single demographic affected, as there are many underlying causes of pericardial effusion.Clinical presentationClinical presentation of pericardial effusions does not relate so much to the size of the effusion but rather the speed at which the fluid has accumulated, as slow gradual accumulation allows the pericardium to stretch and accommodate much larger volumes of fluid 4.Regardless of volume, symptoms relate to impaired cardiac function due to intrapericardial pressure approximating intracardiac pressure leading to an impaired filling of low-pressure chambers, particularly the right atrium.Dyspnea and reduced exercise tolerance will be early signs, progressing to severe impaired cardiac output and death in severe cases (e.g. cardiac tamponade).PathologyEtiology idiopathic (presumed viral, post-viral or immune-related) inflammatory systemic inflammatory conditions or connective tissue diseases systemic lupus erythematosus rheumatoid arthritis scleroderma Sjögren syndrome vasculitis   post-myocardial infarction: Dressler syndrome    infectious viral bacterial tuberculosis   post-surgical or traumatic  pulmonary arterial hypertension 7  radiotherapy malignancy  primary, e.g. pericardial mesothelioma  metastatic paraneoplastic   endocrine hypothyroidism 3   Radiographic featuresPlain radiographSmall pericardial effusions are often occult on plain film. Greater than 200 mL of pericardial fluid is usually required to become radiographically visible. Radiographic signs include: there can be globular enlargement of the cardiac shadow giving a water bottle configuration  lateral CXR may show a vertical opaque line (pericardial fluid) separating a vertical lucent line directly behind the sternum (pericardial fat) anteriorly from a similar lucent vertical lucent line (epicardial fat) posteriorly; this is known as the Oreo cookie sign 5  widening of the subcarinal angle without other evidence of left atrial enlargement may be an indirect clue 2   a differential density sign at cardiac borders has been suggested 9, but its specificity is limited serially enlarging cardiothoracic ratio  hemodynamic compromise may manifest with signs of cardiogenic pulmonary edema  EchocardiographyEchocardiography is the method of choice to confirm the diagnosis, estimate the volume of fluid and most importantly assess the hemodynamic impact of the effusion.An anechoic separation of pericardial layers can be identified on transthoracic echocardiography when pericardial ﬂuid exceeds 50 mL. In a supine patient, the effusion will first appear posteriorly, tracking anterior to the descending aorta and left atrium. The parasternal long-axis and subcostal four-chamber views are typically favored for inspection of the pericardial space.Differentiation from an epicardial fat pad and a left pleural effusion, which have similar sonographic appearances, relies on the recognition of the anatomical boundaries of the fluid collection in question; pleural effusions are bounded anteriorly by the descending aorta, and a fat pad will be seen most prominently in the atrioventricular groove. Additionally, epicardial fat pads have a different echotexture, with low-level echoes scattered throughout  13.CTThe accepted thickness of a normal pericardium, measured on CT scans and on MR images, is often taken at 2 mm 6,10 and abnormal is considered >3-4 mm 10.CT makes the diagnosis extremely easy but is usually obtained to try and clarify the cause of an effusion rather than to confirm the diagnosis. Pericardial effusions are a frequent incidental finding in unwell hospitalized patients.Fluid density material is seen surrounding the heart. Careful inspection of the region is necessary to ensure that no invasive mass can be identified.Estimating volumeThe depth of the effusion can be used to estimate the likely volume of fluid, provided the fluid is relatively evenly spread throughout the pericardium (i.e. global effusion) 4. Clearly, this does not apply to loculated effusions. <5 mm: 50-100 mL 5-10 mm: 100-250 mL 10-20 mm: 250-500 mL >20 mm: >500 mL However, due to complex pericardial anatomy and fluid being able to pool in the pericardial recesses this relationship is not exact, and it may be better to report volume in more general terms 10-12: <10 mm: small 10-20 mm: moderate >20 mm: large Treatment and prognosisIf small, asymptomatic and clinically not-suspect then conservative management is usually favored.If large, symptomatic or there is a clinical concern of the underlying cause (e.g. infection, malignancy) then pericardiocentesis can be performed to drain the fluid. A Seldinger technique is employed, usually under ultrasound/echocardiographic guidance, to insert a drain into the pericardial space 4.In cases where effusions are recurrent and symptomatic (e.g. malignancy) then pericardial fenestration can be performed.Differential diagnosis  hemopericardium: has higher attenuation on CT and often a different clinical context  cardiomegaly: can sometimes mimic an effusion See alsofetal pericardial effusion
__label__Cardiac __label__Chest Pericardial or epicardial fat necrosis is a rare self-limiting cause of acute chest pain in an otherwise healthy individual. It occurs within the mediastinum outside the pericardium. On this page:  Article: Clinical presentation Pathology Radiographic features History and etymology Treatment and prognosis Differential diagnosis References   Images:Cases and figures  Clinical presentationThe patient presents with an acute chest pain that may mimic other cardiopulmonary causes. It is a self-limiting pain, ipsilateral to the lesion, which is more commonly on the left side (can be right-sided). The pain may persist for several weeks. Syncope, tachycardia, dyspnea have also been reported. On physical examination, a pericardial friction rub may be heard. Laboratory findings will be normal.PathologyThe pathogenesis of pericardial fat necrosis is unknown. Some predisposing factors have been mentioned in the literature: trauma ischemia due to an acute torsion high positioned pericardial fat obesity increased thoracic pressure related to the Valsalva maneuver may increase the capillary pressure, which leads to hemorrhagic necrosis Radiographic featuresRadiographjuxtacardiac opacity near the cardiophrenic angle with or without pleural effusion CT ovoid encapsulated mediastinal (pericardial) fatty lesion with soft tissue rim and intrinsic and surrounding soft tissue stranding thickened adjacent epicardium a pleural effusion may be present Findings are similar to that observed with epiploic appendagitis and omental torsion in the peritoneal space.History and etymologyIt is thought to have been first described in 1957 by Jackson et al 8.Treatment and prognosisConservative management with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents and follow-up is usually performed. It is generally considered left limiting.Differential diagnosisPossible differential considerations include: pericardial/epicardial lipoma  pericardial/epicardial liposarcoma  thymolipoma diaphragmatic hernia 
__label__Chest __label__Cardiac Pericardial fat pads are normal structures that lie in the cardiophrenic angle. They are adipose tissues surrounding the heart composed of the epicardial fat, which lies between the myocardium and visceral pericardium, and paracardial fat, which is adherent and external to the parietal pericardium. Unsurprisingly, they are more prominent in obese patients.  On this page:  Article: Pathology Radiographic features Differential diagnosis Related articles References   Images: Cases and figures Imaging differential diagnosis   PathologyThey can be affected by fat necrosis, see: pericardial fat necrosis. Radiographic featuresPlain radiograph mass or hazy opacity in the costodiaphragmatic angle cardiac and diaphragmatic silhouettes usually visible CTeasily differentiates pericardial fat pad from pathology other than a lipomaDifferential diagnosisAt times they are large enough to simulate pathology and can be mistaken for:  lipoma or another pericardial tumor   pericardial cyst (especially on the right) Morgagni hernia epicardial lymphadenopathy  pleural tumor pseudocardiomegaly 
__label__Trauma __label__Chest The pericardial fat tag sign is a sign of pneumothorax on supine CXR where the cardiac border has a lumpy contour.When gas is located in the pleural space between the lung and mediastinum, the pericardial fat is no longer compressed against the mediastinum and therefore can hang or dangle laterally, giving a lumpy or mogul appearance to the cardiac border/s.It is not commonly seen and may be seen in the absence or presence of all the other chest x-ray signs of a supine pneumothorax.

__label__Cardiac The pericardial ligaments is a name given to a group of variable fibrous ligaments or adhesions that connect the pericardium to adjacent structures. These ‘ligaments’ tether the fibrous pericardium to it's surrounds, hence movements of the chest wall and diaphragm  influence the position of the heart and pericardium in the mediastinum.There are 2 main ligaments described in standard texts with differing importance:  pericardiophrenic ligaments: these are strong adhesions where the floor of the fibrous pericardium is firmly attached (and some authors say blended with) the central tendon of the diaphragm.  sternopericardial ligaments: these are weak adhesion that are variably present that connect the anterior fibrous pericardium to the posterior surface of the upper and lower sternum. The fibrous pericardium also blends with the tunica adventitia of the ascending aorta, pulmonary trunk and superior vena cava in the superior mediastinum. There are also un-named adhesions that loosely fix the fibrous pericardium to the posterior mediastinum.
